<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">MPF Science Goals</head><p>MPF provides a statistical census of exoplanets with masses ≥ 0.1M⊕ and orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to ∞. This includes analogs to all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. MPF measures the frequency of planets orbiting all types of stars with spectral type G or later. MPF and Kepler complement each other, and together they cover the entire planetdiscovery space. Whereas Kepler is sensitive to close-in planets but is unable to sense the more distant ones, MPF is less sensitive to close-in planets, but surveys beyond 0.5 AU better than Kepler. MPF's sensitivity extends out even to unbound planets, offering the only possibility to constrain their numbers and masses. Other methods, including groundbased microlensing, cannot approach the sensitivity and comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major-axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing mission provides. Thus, MPF provides the only way to complete the exoplanet census begun by Kepler and gain a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of planetary systems, needed to understand planet formation and habitability. MPF accomplishes these objectives with proven technology and a cost of under $330 million <ref type="bibr">(FY 2009</ref>, excluding launch vehicle).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Basics of Gravitational Microlensing</head><p>The physical basis of microlensing is the gravitational bending of light rays by a star or planet. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, if a "lens star" passes close to the line of sight to a more distant source star, the gravitational field of the lens star deflects the light rays from the source star. The gravitational bending effect of the lens star "splits", distorts, and magnifies the images of the source star. For Galactic microlensing, the image separation is ≤ 4 mas, so the observer sees a microlensing event as a transient brightening of the source as the lens star's proper motion moves it across the line of sight.</p><p>Gravitational microlensing events are characterized by the Einstein ring radius, , where M L is the lens star mass, and D L and D S are the distances to the lens and source, respectively. R E is the radius of the ring image that is seen with perfect alignment between the lens and source stars. The lensing magnification is determined by the alignment of the lens and source stars measured in units of R E , so even low-mass lenses can give rise to high magnification microlensing events. A microlensing event's duration is given by the Einstein ring crossing time, typically 1-3 months for stellar lenses and a few days or less for a planet.  Planets are detected via light curve deviations that differ from the normal stellar lens light curves <ref type="bibr">(Mao &amp; Paczynski 1991)</ref>. Usually, the signal occurs when one of the two images due to lensing by the host star passes close to the location of the planet, as indicated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> ( <ref type="bibr">Gould &amp; Loeb 1992)</ref>, but planets are also detected at very high magnification where the gravitational field of the planet destroys the symmetry of the Einstein ring <ref type="bibr">(Griest &amp; Safi- zadeh 1998</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Capabilities of MPF</head><p>MPF detects planets down to one tenth of an Earth mass. The probability of a detectable planetary signal and its duration both scale as R E ~ , but given the optimum alignment, planetary signals from low-mass planets is quite strong. The limiting mass for the microlensing method occurs when the planetary Einstein radius becomes smaller than the projected radius of the source star <ref type="bibr">(Bennett &amp; Rhie 1996)</ref>. The ~5.5 M⊕ planet detected by <ref type="bibr">Beau- lieu et al. (2006)</ref> is near this limit for a giant source star, but most microlensing events have G or K-dwarf source stars with radii that are at least 10 times smaller than this. So, the sensitivity of the microlensing method extends down to &lt; 0.1M⊕, as the results of a detailed simulation of the MPF mission <ref type="bibr">(Bennett &amp; Rhie 2002)</ref> show in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>Microlensing is sensitive to a wide range of planet-star separations and host star types. The host stars for planets detected by microlensing are a random sample of stars that happen to pass close to the line-of-sight to the source stars in the Galactic bulge, so all common types of stars are surveyed, including G, K, and M-dwarfs, as well as white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. Microlensing is most sensitive to planets at a separation of ~R E (usually 2-3 AU) due to the strong stellar lens magnification at this separation, but the sensitivity extends to arbitrarily large separations. It is only planets well inside R E that are missed because the stellar lens images that would be distorted by these inner planets have very low magnifications and a very small contribution to the total brightness. These features are seen in <ref type="figure">Fig.  2</ref>, which compares the sensitivity of a space microlensing mission (MPF) with expectations for other planned and current programs. Other ongoing and planned programs can detect, at most, analogs of two of the Solar System's planets, while a space-based microlensing survey can detect seven-all but Mercury. The only method with comparable sensitivity to MPF is the Kepler space-based transit survey, which complements the microlensing method with sensitivity at semi-major axes, a ≤ 1 AU. The sensitivities of MPF and Kepler overlap at separations of ~1 AU, which corresponds to the habitable zone for G and K stars. The red crosses in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> indicate the 5 gas giant ( <ref type="bibr">Bond et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Udalski et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudi et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dong et al. 2008</ref>) and four ~10M⊕ "super-earth" planets discovered by ground-based microlensing ( <ref type="bibr">Beaulieu et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gould et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bennett et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sumi et al. in prepa- ration 2009)</ref>. A preliminary analysis suggests that about one third of all stars are likely to have a super-earth at 1.5-4AU whereas radial velocity surveys find that only about 3% of stars have gas giants in this region ( <ref type="bibr">Butler et al. 2006</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows a comparison of the depth or survey estimates made by the Exoplanet Task Force, and this shows that a 4-year space microlensing mission finds a similar number of habitable zone (HZ) planets as an extended Kepler mission. Almost all the HZ planets found by MPF orbit G and K stars.</p><p>Detailed simulations indicate a large number of planet detections. <ref type="bibr">Bennett &amp; Rhie (2002)</ref> and Gaudi (unpublished) have independently simulated space-based microlensing surveys. These simulations included variations in the assumed mission capabilities that allow us to explore how changes in the mission design affect the scientific output, and they form the basis of our predictions in Figs. 2-5. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> shows the expected number of planets that MPF would detect at orbital separations of 0.5-1.5, 1.5-5, and 5-15 AU. This plot assumes an average of one planet per star in each range of separations. Only MPF has a significant detection rate for Earths in all 3 separation ranges, and so only MPF can sample a wide range of separations including the HZ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.  5</ref> shows the expected detection rate for freefloating planets assuming one such planet per star. Free-floating planets are expected to be a common by-product of most planet formation  scenarios, and only MPF detects free-floating planets of ≤ 1M⊕, which are evidence of important dynamical interactions in the later stages of the planet formation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">MPF's Exoplanet Survey Is Needed</head><p>Microlensing relies upon the high density of source and lens stars towards the Galactic bulge to generate the stellar alignments needed to generate microlensing events, but this high star density also means that the bulge main sequence source stars are not generally resolved in ground-based images, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref> demonstrates. This means that the precise photometry needed to detect planets of ≤ 1M⊕ is not possible from the ground unless the magnification due to the stellar lens is moderately high. This, in turn, implies that ground-based microlensing is only sensitive to terrestrial planets located close to the Einstein ring (at ~2-3 AU). The full sensitivity to terrestrial planets in all orbits from 0.5 AU to ∞ comes only from a spacebased survey.</p><p>MPF light curves yield unambiguous planet mass ratios and separations. For the great majority of events, the basic planet parameters (planet:star mass ratio, planet-star separation) can be "read off" the planetary deviation <ref type="bibr">(Gould &amp; Loeb 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bennett &amp; Rhie 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wambsganss 1997)</ref>. Possible ambiguities in the interpretation of planetary microlensing events have been studied in detail <ref type="bibr">(Gaudi &amp; Gould 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gaudi 1998)</ref>, and these can be resolved with high quality, continuous light curves that will be routinely acquired with a space-based microlensing survey.</p><p>Planetary host star detection from space yields precise star and planet parameters. For all but a small fraction of planetary microlensing events, space-based imaging is needed to detect the planetary host stars, and the detection of the host stars allows the star and planet masses and separation in physical units to be determined ( <ref type="bibr">Bennett et al. 2007</ref>). This can be accomplished with HST observations for a small number of planetary microlensing events ( <ref type="bibr">Bennett et al. 2006</ref>), but space-based survey data is needed for the detection of host stars for the thousands of planetary microlensing events that we expect from a space mission. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref> shows the distribution of planetary host star  masses and the predicted uncertainties in the masses and separation of the planets and their host stars ( <ref type="bibr">Bennett et al. 2007</ref>) from simulations of the MPF mission. The host stars with masses determined to better than 20% are indicated by the red histogram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>(a), and these are primarily the host stars that can be detected in MPF images. The distance to the planetary system is determined when the host star is identified, so a space-based microlensing survey will also measure how the properties of exoplanet systems change as a function of distance from the Galactic Center. Data analysis methods have been proven with ground-based and HST data. HST transit and ground-based microlensing surveys have demonstrated the photometric precision needed by MPF, and current light curve modeling methods need only be automated for MPF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">MPF Constrains Planet Formation</head><p>Theories Rapid advancement in exoplanet research is driven by both extensive observational searches around mature stars as well as the construction of planet formation and models. Perhaps the most surprising discovery so far is the great diversity in the planets' dynamical properties, but these results are largely confined to planets that are unusually massive or reside in very close orbits. The core accretion theory suggests most planets are much less massive than gas giants and that the critical region for understanding planet formation is the "snow-line", located in the region (1.5-4 AU) of greatest microlensing sensitivity <ref type="bibr">(Ida &amp; Lin 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kennedy et al. 2006</ref>). Early results from ground-based microlensing searches ( <ref type="bibr">Beaulieu et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gould et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ben- nett et al. 2008</ref>) appear to confirm these expectations. A space-based microlensing survey would extend the current sensitivity of the microlensing method down to masses of ~0.1M⊕ over a large range (0.5AU-∞) in separation, and in combination with Kepler, such a mission provides sensitivity to sub-Earth mass planets at all separations. The semi-major axis region probed by space-microlensing provides a cleaner test of planet formation theories than the close-in planets detected by other methods, because planets discovered at &gt; 0.5 AU are more likely to have formed in situ than the close-in planets. The sensitivity region for space-microlensing includes the outer habitable zone for G and K stars through the "snowline" and beyond, and the lower sensitivity limit reaches the regime of planetary embryos at ~0.1M⊕. Perhaps such planets are much more common than planets of 1M⊕ because their type-1 migration time is much longer.</p><p>The habitability of a planet depends on its formation history. The suitability of a planet for life depends on a number of factors, such as the average surface temperature, which determines if the planet resides in the habitable zone. However, there are many other factors that also may be important, such as the presence of sufficient water and other volatile compounds necessary for life ( <ref type="bibr">Raymond et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lissauer 2007</ref>). Thus, a reasonable understanding of planet formation is an important foundation for the search for nearby habitable planets and life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5.">Exoplanet Task Force Endorsement</head><p>The Exoplanet Task Force (ExoPTF) recently released a report <ref type="bibr">(Lunine et al. 2008</ref>) that evaluated all of the current and proposed methods to find and study exoplanets, and they expressed strong support for space-based microlensing. Their finding regarding spacebased microlensing states that: "Space-based microlensing is the optimal approach to providing a true statistical census of planetary systems in the Galaxy, over a range of likely semi-major axes, and can likely be conducted with a Discovery-class mission." Their conclusion that a space-based microlensing survey can be conducted with a Discovery-class mission, is in agreement with the judgment of the 2006 Discovery review panel, which found that the proposed Microlensing Planet Finder costs were credible. The ExoPTF's support of space-based microlensing is also reflected in their recommendation B.II.2, which states: "Without impacting the launch schedule of the astrometric mission cited above, launch a Discovery-class space-based microlensing mission to determine the statistics of planetary mass and the separation of planets from their host stars as a function of stellar type and location in the galaxy, and to derive η⊕ over a very large sample."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MPF Technical Overview</head><p>The MPF uses a small telescope with a wide field to monitor 2×10 8 stars in the Galactic bulge for 9 months per year. For three months per year, the Sun is near the Bulge and MPF is available for other science. The MPF flies in an inclined geosynchronous orbit for continuous ground contact. Thick shields protect the detector from trapped cosmic rays. Normal operations are a repeated pattern of observations of several adjacent fields, combined with small dithers for improved spatial resolution. Twice a year, the MPF rolls 180 degrees to keep the Sun out of the instrument. The spacecraft uses avionics flown on Spitzer, XSS-11 and the upcoming IRIS mission, and achieves fine pointing with sensors in the main focal plane.</p><p>The MPF observatory total (dry) mass is 820 kg and its total required power is 445W. Both of these numbers include contingency. The MPF mission is compatible with the Delta 2920-9.5, Delta 4040-12, or Atlas V 501 launch vehicles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detector Producibility</head><p>The initial H2RG detectors were produced over 8 years ago, and the current process is mature. The interconnect yield of 2Kx2K HAWAII-2 FPAs over the past 2 years is &gt; 99.9%. Team member Lockheed Martin developed the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and NICMOS. Team members developed MercuryCadmium-Telluride detectors (2.5 µm cutoff, liquid phase epitaxy), the HST Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) detector (1.7 µm cutoff, molecular beam epitaxy), culminating in stateof-the-art performance for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 2.5 µm and 5.0 µm cutoff arrays. Detectors with the same technology were used in NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper, the WISE all-sky infrared survey, and are flying to Pluto in the New Horizons' Ralph instrument.</p><p>The performance delivered by the WFC3 and JWST detectors is easily sufficient for the relatively bright objects that will be observed by MPF. The large number of detectors in MPF, coupled with its survey-mode strategy, substantially reduces the operability requirements on each detector. While the number of detectors required is relatively large, the requirements are loose and the yield is high.</p><p>Using the TIS SIDECAR ASIC for detector control and readout provides significant reduction in system-level complexity and cost. This device has been qualified for flight on JWST, and was installed in the Advanced Camera for Surveys during the HST Servicing Mission 4 where it has been operational since mid-2009.</p><p>A model of an MPF-like focal plane (photo in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>) has demonstrated the packaging techniques and the integration and alignment processes. Similar ground-based arrays have been successful, e.g. the SiC focal plane for the WIYN One-Degree-Imager.</p></div>

This orbit permits continuous communication with a ground station at White Sands, NM, allowing real-time operations and continuous data down link. It also allows the MPF Galactic bulge field to be observed for 9 months per year, leaving 3 months per year available for a GO program.</p></div>

The PCS modes are described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. The fine pointing mode architecture utilizes reaction wheels, gyros, and the Focal Plane Array.</p><p>Sun sensors, star trackers, and rate gyros are used to control attitude in transitional and contingency modes of operation and to orient the observatory within the acquisition range of the instrument's fine guidance function.</p><p>To acquire the target region, the instrument focal plane is used as a star camera to match an on-board star catalog. Windows on the focal plane array track guide stars and provide fine guidance during observations. 3-axis attitude control is provided by four reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs), operated with zero net momentum, biased to avoid vibrational harmonics. RWA momentum is unloaded using thrusters, and the solar array and high gain antenna are moved, between sensitive observations. The photometric pointing stability requirement of 0.2 pixel determines the needed pointing stability of 0.048 arcsec. Modeling shows that the S/C meets the requirements. The Kepler mission uses the same concept, deriving error signals from its large mosaic detector.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Organization and Current Status</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">MPF Organization</head><p>The MPF team is led by Principal Investigator, David Bennett, who is a pioneer in the gravitational microlensing field, having helped to initiate the MACHO Project, which discovered the first gravitational microlensing event in 1993. He was (with S.H. Rhie) the first to show that gravitational microlensing could detect Earth-mass planets, and he has played a lead role in the analysis of most of the 11 exoplanets found by microlensing to date. These discoveries include two that were the lowest mass exoplanet known at the time of their discovery, including the current record holder, <ref type="bibr">MOA-2007</ref><ref type="bibr">-BLG-192Lb (Bennett et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>Because there is very little space hardware experience in the gravitational microlensing community, the role of Deputy Principal Investigator, Edward Cheng, is critically important. Cheng has 20 yrs experience in detectors and spaceflight missions. Mather is NASA's only Nobel Prize winner, and he will recruit some of Goddard's top engineers to work on MPF, when it is selected for flight.</p><p>MPF's spacecraft will be provided by Lockheed Martin and the telescope and focal plane will be provided by ITT and Teledyne Imaging Sensors, respectively.</p><p>A group from the Space Telescope Science Institute including Scott Friedman and Jay Anderson will handle the primary data analysis and archiving, and a group under the direction of the PI at the University of Notre Dame will do the light curve analysis. Since the 2006 Discovery competition a number of MPF components, such as the H2RG detectors and the SIDECAR ASIC electronics have advanced in their development, so MPF's technology is significantly more mature now than it was in 2006.</p><p>Most recently, a space-based microlensing planet survey, like MPF, was considered and endorse by last year's Exoplanet Task Force ( <ref type="bibr">Lunine et al. 2008)</ref>, provided that it could be done (like MPF) at the cost of a Discovery mission. However, NASA has recently decided to remove exoplanet missions from the Discovery line in favor of a new Exoplanet Probe line. If this new Exoplanet Probe line is started, it is expected to have a significantly higher cost cap than Discovery. So, MPF would be much cheaper than the Exoplanet Probe cost cap. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> is a summary of the MPF schedule for a 4-year mission, showing the critical path in red. This schedule follows the constraints of the NASA Discovery program, which usually limits phase C/D to 4 years or less. This is appropriate for low-cost missions, like MPF, which do not require technology development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">MPF Schedule</head><p>The schedule has more than 30 days per year (Phase B-D) of funded reserve. Trade studies, SSR, PDR, and procurement of long lead items are scheduled for Phase B. Phase C/D contains the CDR, flight build, integration, environmental test campaign, launch on 15-Jan-2016, and a 30-day initial on-orbit checkout (IOC). Phase E, the science operations and data analysis phase, starts at the end of IOC and lasts 4 years, ending on 15-Feb-2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">MPF Cost Estimates</head><p>The MPF mission cost was studied quite thoroughly during the preparation of the MPF proposal that was submitted to the 2006 NASA Discovery competition. The cost studies included a bottoms-up analysis by the MPF team, including NASA/GSFC, Lockheed Mar-  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>The use of the 2006 cost estimates is conservative because many of MPF's technologies have become more mature during the past three years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">MPF Cost Models</head><p>In addition to this bottoms-up analysis, costs were also estimated using two commercially available hardware cost models, PRICE H and SEER-H. These analyses were done in <ref type="bibr">March, 2006</ref>, by the GSFC Resource Analysis Office (RAO).</p><p>Both the PRICE H and SEER-H cost modeling programs produced cost estimates that came within 10% of the bottoms up costs. Similarly, the PRICE H and SEER-H models estimated spacecraft costs that were very close to the bottoms-up cost estimate.</p><p>At the time that the SEER-H analysis was run, the model was ill equipped to handle the costing of the IR detectors that will be used for MPF. Because of this difficulty with SEER-H, we used the actual costs for the JWST NIRSpec detectors in lieu of SEER-H to estimate the detector costs. This is a conservative procedure because the JWST NIRSpec detector requirements are much more stringent than the MPF requirements, and the production process has continued to improve at Teledyne Imaging Sensors. So, it is very likely that the MPF detectors can be produced with a higher yield of flight-quality detectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">2006 Discovery Cost Review</head><p>The MPF cost estimates presented here were reviewed by the TMCO (Technical, Management, Cost, Other) panel for the 2006 NASA Discovery program review. The TMCO panel did three independent cost estimates, and then compared them to reach a consensus cost. Their consensus cost was within 12% of the costs proposed by the MPF team and presented here.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Optional General Observer Program</head><p>MPF can only search for planets in its Galactic bulge fields for 9 months per year when the bulge is more than 45° away from the sun. The other 3 months per year can be devoted to an optional General Observer (GO) program, but the costs of administering this GO program are not included in this cost estimate. However, mission operations and MPF pipeline data reduction during these 3 months per year are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">MPF Summary</head><p>The Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) is a low-cost planetary survey mission that will complete the census of extrasolar planetary systems that is now being begun by Kepler. While Kepler will provide important results on the frequency of close-in planets at separations ≤ 1 AU, MPF is needed to learn about planets in outer orbits. MPF is sensitive to planets down to 0.1 Earth-masses at orbital separations of ≥ 0.5 AU, including the habitable zone for G and K stars. The sensitivity region of MPF (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) includes 7 of the 8 solar system planets, as well as the vicinity of the "snow-line" where the first planets are predicted to form by the core accretion theory. This is also the region where the Earth's water is thought to originate, so an understanding of the planet formation process near the "snow-line" is needed for considerations of planetary habitability.</p><p>The importance of MPF's census of extrasolar planets at orbital separations of ≥ 0.5 AU was recognized by the Exoplanet Task Force, which recommended a space-based microlensing survey if it could be done at the cost of a Discovery mission.</p><p>The MPF mission requirements are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. MPF continuously observes four 0.65 sq. deg. fields in the central Galactic Bulge using an inclined geostationary orbit to provide a continuous view of the Galactic Bulge fields and a continuous downlink. MPF will use a dedicated ground station co-located with other NASA facilities at White Sands, NM. Spacecraft commanding and on-board processing are minimized because of the simple observation plan and orbit design.</p><p>MPF system. MPF uses a 1.1m ThreeMirror Anastigmat (TMA) telescope feeding a  146.8 Mpixel HgCdTe focal plane residing on a standard spacecraft. The MPF design leverages existing hardware and design concepts, many of which are already demonstrated onorbit and/or flight qualified. The spacecraft bus is a near-identical copy of that used for Spitzer and has demonstrated performance that meets MPF requirements. The telescope system leverages Ikonos and NextView commercial Earth-observing telescope designs that provide extensive diffraction-limited images. The focal plane design taps proven technologies developed for JWST. All elements are at TRL 6 or better. The focal plane design uses common non-destructive readout CMOS multiplexers for two detector technologies that cover the visible and the near-IR. The MPF focal plane can track up to 35 guide stars in the field, providing a built-in fine guidance capability. The focal plane gains additional advantages from using the Teledyne SIDECAR™ application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that condenses all the control and readout electronics into a "system-on-a-chip" implementation. This approach dramatically simplifies the support electronics while minimizing wire-count challenges.</p><p>Cost. The total cost for the MPF mission is (FY09) $330M including 30% contingency during development, but excluding the launch vehicle.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: The geometry of a microlensing planet search towards the Galactic bulge.
