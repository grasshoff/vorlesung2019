				<p>Giant planet formation by core accretion requires a core that is sufficiently massive to trigger runaway gas accretion in less that the typical lifetime of protoplanetary disks. We explore how the minimum required core mass, M crit , depends on a non-ideal equation of state and on opacity changes due to grain growth, across a range of stellocentric distances from 5-100 AU. This minimum M crit applies when planetesimal accretion does not substantially heat the atmosphere. Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular hydrogen (H 2) dissociation and variable occupation of H 2 rotational states increases M crit. Specifically, M crit increases by a factor of ∼2 if the H 2 spin isomers, ortho-and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a factor of ∼2 − 4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3:1. Lower opacities due to grain growth reduce M crit. For a standard disk model around a Solar mass star, we calculate M crit ∼ 8M ⊕ at 5 AU, decreasing to ∼5M ⊕ at 100 AU, for a realistic EOS with an equilibrium ortho-to-para ratio and for grain growth to cm-sizes. If grain coagulation is taken into account, M crit may further reduce by up to one order of magnitude. These results for the minimum critical core mass are useful for the interpretation of surveys that find exoplanets at a range of orbital distances.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Core accretion -a prominent theory of giant planet formation -stipulates that Jupiter-sized planets form when planetesimal accretion produces a solid core large enough to attract a massive atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mizuno et al. 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, Stevenson 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986</ref><ref type="bibr">, Wuchterl 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">, D'Angelo et al. 2011</ref>). Because protoplanetary disks dissipate on timescales of a few Myrs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jayawardhana et al. 1999</ref>), cores must grow quickly to accrete disk gas. Fast growth is particularly challenging far from a core's host star, where dynamical times are long. Understanding whether core accretion can work in the outer disk may provide valuable insights into the formation of wide-separation planets such as the directlyimaged giants orbiting HR 8799 <ref type="bibr">(Marois et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>Production of such planets in situ by core accretion requires faster core growth rates than typically assumed. However, even if fast growth could be achieved, it produces an additional difficulty. Though the minimum, or critical, core mass to form a giant planet is often quoted as M crit ∼ 10M ⊕ , the actual value depends on how quickly the core accretes planetesimals (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pol- lack et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Ikoma et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Rafikov 2006</ref>). Fast accretion heats a core's atmosphere, increasing pressure support and hence M crit . Rafikov (2011) finds that beyond 40-50 AU, a core cannot reach M crit while accreting at the rate it requires to grow during its host disk's lifetime.</p><p>This limit on the distance at which core accretion operates may be overcome if core growth does not proceed at a constant rate. Time-dependent models (e.g., Pollack <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138; apiso@cfa.harvard.edu 2 Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933 N Cherry Ave, <ref type="bibr">Tucson AZ 85721</ref> 3 Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA <ref type="bibr">93106</ref> et al. 1996; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ikoma et al. 2000)</ref> suggest that a planets's feeding zone may be depleted of planetesimals before disk dissipation, causing core growth to stall. Planetesimal accretion no longer deposits energy into the atmosphere which, without this balance for radiative losses, cannot maintain a steady state. The envelope accretes gas while undergoing Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) contraction. In this regime, a core of any mass would evolve into a giant planet if given an infinite amount of time. In practice, a core produces a giant planet if it has enough time to accumulate an atmosphere of approximately its own mass before its host disk dissipates. The minimum core mass satisfying this criterion is M crit .</p><p>Because extra heating increases an atmosphere's pressure, opposing runaway envelope growth, M crit is smallest in the absence of planetesimal accretion. While M crit has been systematically computed as a function of disk properties and stellocentric separation for steady-state atmospheres heated by planetesimal accretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Rafikov 2006</ref>), no equivalent systematic study is available for this minimum value of M crit .</p><p>In <ref type="bibr">Piso &amp; Youdin (2014, hereafter Paper I)</ref> and this paper, we provide such a systematic study. Given a fiducial disk model, we calculate the M crit required to nucleate runaway atmospheric growth for a fully formed-and no longer accreting-core. We model the planet's evolution using a series of quasi-static two-layer atmospheres embedded in a protoplanetary disk. Here, we build on the results of Paper I by making two important additions: (1) a realistic equation of state (EOS), and (2) realistic dust opacities. Our aim is twofold: (1) to explain how hydrogen and helium's non-ideal EOS affects atmospheric growth when compared to an ideal gas, and (2) to provide realistic estimates for the minimum critical core mass required to form a giant planet over a range of semimajor axes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Equation of State</head><p>We use the EOS of hydrogen and helium mixtures calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref>, which captures nonideal effects such as dissociation, ionization, and selective occupation of quantum states at low temperatures. We extend these tables to the very low temperatures and pressures required for planets forming in the outer regions of disks (Appendix A). The EOS tables from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> have often been used to model the interiors of giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pollack et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Ikoma et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Alibert et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">, Hubickyj et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">, Papaloizou &amp; Nelson 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">, Mordasini et al. 2012</ref>), as well as in complex stellar evolution simulations involving low temperatures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Paxton et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">, Paxton et al. 2013</ref>, which use the code MESA). More recent EOS tables ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Nettelmann et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">, Nettelmann et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">, Militzer &amp; Hubbard 2013</ref>) are based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and thus avoid some of the approximations of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> semi-analytical approach. However, though these newer tables are sufficient to model the internal structures of Jupiter and of close-in extrasolar planets, they do not extend to the low temperatures and pressures required for wide-separation planets (T 500 K, P 1 GPa, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Militzer &amp; Hubbard 2013)</ref>. Moreover, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Militzer &amp; Hubbard (2013)</ref> EOS tables and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> tables are in good agreement for entropies, S, such that log 10 (S) 8.75 erg g −1 K −1 . All models presented here satisfy this constraint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Opacity</head><p>Opacities in protoplanetary disks are unlikely to be interstellar, and are lowered by grain growth and dust settling. Numerous studies have demonstrated that atmospheric evolution depends strongly on opacity-lower opacities accelerate envelope growth and reduce M crit . For example, the analytic model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Stevenson (1982)</ref> showed that M crit ∝ κ 3/4 for a fully radiative envelope with constant opacity κ. A series of more modern studies conclude that: Jupiter may have formed in 1 Myr with a core of 10M ⊕ for an opacity arbitrarily reduced to 2% of the interstellar value ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hubickyj et al. 2005)</ref>; M crit for Jupiter may be as low as ∼1M ⊕ for a grain free envelope <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hori &amp; Ikoma 2010)</ref>; and the use of grain opacities that take into account coagulation and settling reduces the formation time for Jupiter by up to 80% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Movshovitz et al. 2010</ref>). A recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mordasini et al. (2014)</ref> investigates the effect of opacity on the formation of populations of synthetic planets, and finds from comparisons with observations that opacities are likely to be much smaller than interstellar. Lastly, Paper I shows that reducing the opacity from interstellar to 1% of interstellar reduces M crit by a factor of ∼2.</p><p>Thus, to provide realistic estimates for M crit , we must employ realistic opacities. For temperatures below dust sublimation, we employ opacity tables from D' <ref type="bibr">Alessio et al. (2001)</ref>, which are used to model observations of protoplanetary disks. We present results for both a standard collisional cascade grain size distribution and for a shallower distribution, appropriate for coagulation (see Section 5 for details). At high temperatures, where dust sublimates, we employ the analytic opacity law of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell &amp; Lin (1994)</ref>. For our purposes, this expression sufficiently represents the more detailed opacity tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Semenov et al. (2003)</ref> with reduced computational complexity (see Appendix C). We note that most previous works that study the quantitative effects of opacity reductions on M crit are primarily focused on the formation of Jupiter at 5.2 AU. In contrast, our aim is to provide realistic estimates for M crit for a larger parameter space, and to analyze the dependence of M crit on semimajor axis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Paper Plan</head><p>After reviewing the quasi-static and cooling models derived in Paper I (Section 2), we add a non-ideal EOS. Because the adiabatic gradient, ad , is an important determinant of atmospheric structure, we first explain how dissociation and variable occupation of low-energy rotational states change ad (Section 3). Section 4 presents the impact of these effects on atmosphere evolution. We introduce realistic opacities in Section 5 and determine M crit in Section 6. Section 7 compares our results to those obtained by studies employing high planetesimal accretion rates. We summarize our findings in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ATMOSPHERIC MODEL REVIEW</head><p>We begin with a brief review of Paper I's model for the structure and evolution of a planetary atmosphere embedded in a protoplanetary disk. We summarize assumptions of the model and properties of our assumed disk in §2.1 and list expressions for the atmosphere's structure and time evolution in §2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Assumptions and Disk Model</head><p>We assume that the planet consists of a solid core of fixed mass and a two-layer atmosphere composed of an inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches smoothly onto the disk. The two regions are separated by the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability (see §2.2) at radius r = R RCB , known as the radiative-convective boundary (RCB). We assume that the luminosity is constant throughout the radiative region (see Section §6 for additional discussion). Note that a similar method is used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Papaloizou &amp; Nelson (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mordasini et al. (2012)</ref>, who find that it agrees with more complex models.</p><p>Our model applies when planetesimal accretion is minimal, so that the envelope's evolution is dominated by KH contraction (see §7 for a discussion of the physical conditions required for a core to be in this regime). The atmosphere is spherically symmetric, self-gravitating and in hydrostatic balance. We apply our model at semimajor axes a 5 AU. Here the disk scale height is larger than the radius at which the planet matches onto the disk (see Paper I for further details), and hence spherical symmetry holds. The nebular gas is composed of a hydrogen-helium mixture, with hydrogen and helium mass fractions of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. Because the envelope grows slowly, we calculate its evolution using a series of linked quasi-static equilibrium models.</p><p>The temperature and pressure at the outer boundary of the atmosphere are given by the nebular temperature and pressure. We use the minimum mass, passively irradiated disk model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chiang &amp; Youdin (2010)</ref>. The surface density, mid-plane temperature and mid-plane pressure are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Σ d = 2200 (a/AU) −3/2 g cm −2</formula><p>(1a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T d = 120 (a/AU) −3/7 K (1b) P d = 11 (a/AU) −45/14 dyn cm −2 ,<label>(1c)</label></formula><p>for a mean molecular weight µ = 2.35.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Structure Equations and Cooling Model</head><p>The structure of a static atmosphere is described by the standard equations of hydrostatic balance and thermal equilibrium:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dP dr = − Gm r 2 ρ (2a) dm dr = 4πr 2 ρ (2b) dT dr = T P dP dr (2c) dL dr = 4πr 2 ρ( + g ), (2d)</formula><p>where r is the radial coordinate, P , T and ρ are the gas pressure, temperature, and density, respectively, m is the mass enclosed by radius r, L is the luminosity from the surface of radius r, and G is the gravitational constant. The gas is heated at a rate g ≡ −T dS/dt per unit mass due to gravitational contraction, where S is the specific gas entropy, while represents the rate at which internal heat is generated per unit mass. We do not take into account any internal energy sources and set = 0. The temperature gradient ≡ d ln T /d ln P depends on whether energy is transported throughout the atmosphere by radiation or convection. In the case of radiative diffusion for an optically thick gas, the temperature gradient is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= rad ≡ 3κP 64πGmσT 4 L,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and κ is the dust opacity. In our models the atmosphere is optically thick throughout the outer boundary. Where energy is transported by convection, the temperature gradient is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= ad ≡ d ln T d ln P ad ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with ad the adiabatic temperature gradient. The convective and radiative layers of the envelope are separated by the Schwarzschild criterion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Thompson 2006</ref>): the atmosphere is stable against convection when &lt; ad and convectively unstable when &gt; ad . Since convective energy transport is highly efficient, ≈ ≈ ad in convecting regions. The temperature gradient is thus given by = min( ad , rad ).</p><p>Equation set (2) is supplemented by an equation of state (EOS) relating pressure, temperature and density, as well as an opacity law. As summarized in Sections 1.1 and 1.2, this paper improves on the ideal gas polytropic EOS and interstellar medium dust opacity employed in Paper I. We discuss the impact of our choices in Sections 3, 4, and 5.</p><p>We assume that the atmosphere forms around a solid core of fixed mass M c with a radius R c = (3M c /4πρ c ) 1/3 , where ρ c is the core density. We choose ρ c = 3.2 g cm −3 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem 1999</ref>). Two radial scales determine the extent of the atmosphere: the Hill radius, R H ≡ a[M p /(3M )] 1/3 , where the gravitational attraction of the planet and the tidal gravity due to the host star are equal, and the Bondi radius,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R B ≡ GM p /c 2 s = GM p /(RT d ),</formula><p>where the thermal energy of the nebular gas is approximately the gravitational energy of the planet. Here, M p is the total planet mass, c s is the isothermal sound speed, R = k B /(µm p ) is the reduced gas constant, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and m p the proton mass. We define the planet mass as the mass enclosed inside the smaller of R B or R H . For R B &lt; R H , several studies assume that the atmosphere matches onto the disk at R B (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ikoma et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Pollack et al. 1996</ref>. In all cases, we choose the Hill radius as our outer boundary because the temperature and pressure at R H are those of the disk, T (R H ) = T d and P (R H ) = P d (see Paper I for more details). Outside R B , gas flows no longer circulate the planet, but rather belong to the disk. However, when R B &lt; R H , the density structure between R B and R H remains spherical and is still well described by hydrostatic balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ormel 2013</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we employ a cooling model developed in Paper I to determine the time evolution of the atmosphere between subsequent static models. A protoplanetary atmosphere embedded in a gas disk emits a total luminosity</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L = L c + Γ − ˙ E + e acc ˙ M − P M ∂V M ∂t .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Here, L c is the luminosity from the solid core, which may include planetesimal accretion and radioactive decay, and Γ is the rate of internal heat generation. We set L c = Γ = 0. The ˙ E term is the rate at which total energy (internal and gravitational) is lost. Gas accretes at a rate ˙ M (r) with a specific energy e(r) = u(r) − GM (r)/r, where u(r) is the internal energy per unit mass and M (r) is the mass enclosed by radius r. To evaluate Equation 5, we choose a boundary radius r = R, so that e acc = e(R). Finally, the last term in Equation 5 represents the work done on a surface mass element.</p><p>We obtain an evolutionary series for the atmosphere by connecting sets of subsequent static atmospheres through the cooling Equation (5). Details of our numerical procedure are described in Paper I. In contrast with Paper I, we evaluate Equation (5) at R B rather than R RCB . This ensures that our calculations are consistent, because realistic opacities introduce inner radiative windows in the atmospheric structure and thus multiple RCBs (see Section 5).</p><p>3. ADIABATIC GRADIENT FOR THE TABULATED EQUATION OF STATE For our gas equation of state, we use the interpolated EOS tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> for a helium mass fraction Y = 0.3, and extend them to lower temperatures and pressures corresponding to the conditions in our fiducial disk. Appendix A describes our extension procedure.</p><p>For ease of discussion, we choose to represent the EOS through the adiabatic gradient ad (defined in Equa-tion 4). In contrast with an ideal gas polytrope, the EOS of a realistic gas cannot be fully specified by ad . The <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> EOS tables are obtained using free energy minimization (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Graboske et al. 1969)</ref>, which provides additional information about the relationship between the thermodynamic variables. Nevertheless, ad is a useful parameter for understanding atmospheric structure. For an ideal gas polytropic EOS, the adiabatic gradient is constant. Non-ideal effects such as dissociation or ionization produce temperaturedependent variations in ad . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a contour plot of ad as a function of gas temperature and pressure. We distinguish three separate temperature regimes:</p><p>1. Intermediate temperature regime <ref type="bibr">(300 K T 2000 K)</ref>, where the hydrogen-helium mixture behaves like an ideal gas with a polytropic EOS.</p><p>2. High temperature regime <ref type="bibr">(T 2000 K)</ref>, where dissociation of molecular hydrogen occurs, followed by ionization of atomic hydrogen for T 10, 000 K.</p><p>3. Low temperature regime (T 300 K), where the rotational states of the hydrogen molecule are not fully excited.</p><p>We note that helium behaves like an ideal monatomic gas with ad = 2/5 in our regime of interest. Its presence in the atmosphere thus only causes a small, constant upward shift in the adiabatic gradient of the mixture. . The regions in which the EOS is either invalid or not computed are masked in white. Further details about the masked regions can be found in Appendix A.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Intermediate T : Ideal Gas</head><p>For 300 K T 2000 K, the hydrogen molecule is not energetic enough to dissociate and hydrogen behaves as an ideal diatomic gas with constant ad <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). The monatomic helium component increases the adiabatic index slightly, so that ad ≈ 0.3 rather than 2/7 for a pure diatomic gas. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">High T : Dissociation and Ionization of Hydrogen</head><p>Hydrogen is molecular at low temperatures, dissociates at T 2000 − 3000 K, and ionizes at T 10, 000 K. In stellar and giant planet interiors there is little overlap between the two processes: hydrogen is almost entirely dissociated into atoms by the time ionization becomes important.</p><p>As displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the adiabatic gradient decreases significantly in regions of partial dissociation and partial ionization. This reduction occurs because dissociation and ionization act as energy sinks. When internal energy is input into a partially dissociated gas, a portion is used to break down molecules, reducing the amount available to increase the temperature of the system.</p><p>An expression for ad as a function of the dissociation fraction is presented in Appendix B.1. As expected, ad is 2/7 for pure molecular hydrogen and 2/5 when hydrogen is fully dissociated, but decreases significantly during partial dissociation and is smallest when half of the gas is dissociated. Note that this behavior differs from a mixture of molecular and atomic hydrogen, for which 2/7 &lt; ad &lt; 2/5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Low T : Hydrogen Rotation and Spin Isomers</head><p>The (diatomic) hydrogen molecule has five degrees of freedom, three associated with translational motion and two associated with rotation. At T well above the molecule's excitation temperature for rotation, Θ r ≈ 85 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kittel et al. 1981)</ref>, its rotational states are fully excited and its EOS is that of an ideal diatomic gas (Section 3.1). As T → 0, rotation ceases entirely and ad ≈ 2/5, the value for an ideal monatomic gas. At temperatures comparable to Θ r , the rotational states of H 2 are are partially excited, and its EOS depends on the relative occupation of two isomeric forms, parahydrogen and orthohydrogen, distinguished by the spin symmetry of the molecule's two protons.</p><p>Because protons are fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle implies that the total wave function of H 2 must be antisymmetric with respect to proton exchange. Two components of the wave function may provide this asymmetry-proton spins and the molecule's rotational state. Parahydrogen has antiparallel proton spins and thus can only occupy symmetric rotational states with even angular quantum number j (Farkas 1935). In contrast, orthohydrogen has parallel proton spins, and can only occupy states with odd j. In thermal equilibrium at T → 0 all hydrogen molecules are in the ground state with j = 0, which corresponds to parahydrogen. As temperature increases, parahydrogen starts converting into orthohydrogen. Because the proton spin state is a triplet for orthohydrogen and a singlet for parahydrogen, this conversion plateaus at an ortho-para equilibrium ratio of 3:1 for T 150 K.</p><p>Spin conversion requires energy. In thermal equilibrium, a portion of any internal energy input at <ref type="bibr">20 T 4</ref> Recall that for an ideal gas, ad ≡ γ−1 γ , where the adiabatic index γ = 7/5 for a diatomic gas and 5/3 for a monatomic gas.</p><p>150K is used to convert para-to orthohydrogen, reducing the amount available to increase T . As a result, ad declines ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>; see Appendix B.2 for further discussion).</p></div>

In isolation, isomeric conversion requires a forbidden transition and has a timescale longer than the age of the universe (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pachucki &amp; Komasa 2008)</ref>. Fast conversion requires a magnetic catalyst to aid the transition between the triplet and singlet spin states.</p><p>In astrophysical contexts, this catalyst is typically provided by collisions with ions such as H + or H + 3 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lique et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lique et al. , 2014</ref>.

Equation 5 and ignoring surface terms, which only become significant in the late stages of atmospheric evolution) is lower than in the polytropic case. Slower gas accretion increases the growth time of the atmosphere. Since envelope growth is faster for larger cores, we calculate a larger M crit . Modifications in the EOS affect L and −dE/dM because both of these quantities depend on the global structure of the envelope. From Equation (3) applied at the RCB where ad = rad , and for a fixed atmospheric mass, the luminosity emerging from the convective interior scales as L ∝ T 4 RCB /P RCB . We have shown in Paper I that the outer radiative layer of the atmosphere is nearly isothermal, and that T RCB is only a factor unity correction from the disk temperature, while the pressure in the radiative region increases exponentially with depth. It follows that L primarily scales as 1/P RCB . This pressure depth at the RCB depends on both the interior structure of the atmosphere at high temperatures, and on the matching to the nebula through the radiative region at low temperatures. Similarly, the EOS affects the distribution of total energy E(r) throughout the envelope, and thus −dE/dM .</p><p>Since both dissociation deep in the convective interior and variable occupation of rotation states in the outer envelope affect atmospheric structure and evolution, it is helpful to separate these effects and study them independently. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the time evolution of atmospheres forming at 5 AU around cores of mass M c = 10M ⊕ and described by various equations of state, as follows:</p><p>1.

However, −eρr 3 for EOS 3 and EOS 4 is much larger in magnitude near the core when compared to the others. This is due to the fact that ad decreases in dissociation regions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Dissociation adds particles to the gas and hence increases its entropy. In order for entropy to stay constant with radius in the convective interior, the temperature must drop, lowering ad and |dT /dr| and resulting in lower temperatures near the core (cf. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, bottom-left). Because the specific internal energy u ∝ T , dissociation decreases the total energy deep in the interior. Note that this loss of thermal energy due to dissociation can be large enough to trigger dynamical instabilities and eventual collapse in higher mass objects such as protostars <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Larson 1969)</ref> or during the runaway growth of giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bodenheimer et al. 1980</ref>).</p><p>The reduced total energy of an atmosphere with a realistic EOS can also be explained qualitatively using ad . The density profile in an adiabatic, non-selfgravitating atmosphere composed of an ideal gas scales as ρ(r) ∝ r −1/ ad +1 , and the total specific energy is e(r) ∝ 1/r (see Paper I). Thus −eρr 3 ∼ r −1/ ad +3 . The total energy is concentrated near the core if ad &lt; 1/3, and at the outer boundary otherwise.

However, our scenario of low planetesimal accretion is likely to favor lower dust opacities, due to grain growth and dust settling. Grain growth, in particular, lowers the absolute value of the opacity, and may change the particle size distribution when compared to the standard ISM size distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pollack et al. 1985</ref>). Enhanced metallicity due to planetesimal accretion, by construction not present during our atmosphere's growth, cannot make up for this reduction.</p><p>Although grain growth and evidence for a non-ISM size distribution have been observed in protoplanetary disks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beckwith et al. 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Beckwith &amp; Sargent 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">, Pérez et al. 2012</ref>), the size distribution of dust particles has not been tightly constrained.

In this work we use the D' <ref type="bibr">Alessio et al. (2001)</ref> frequency-dependent opacity tables to obtain the temperature-dependent Rosseland mean opacity κ. We take as a fiducial case a maximum particle size s max = 1 cm and a grain size distribution given by Equation (11) with p = 3.5. Other choices for the power-law coefficient p are discussed later in this section. Though we choose our opacities to reflect ambient conditions in the disk, we note that grains can also grow within an accreting atmosphere, decreasing its opacity at depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Movshovitz et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mordasini 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ormel 2014</ref>).

Additionally, the weak temperature dependence of grain growth opacities may cause larger outer radiative zones than when ISM opacities are used. This could pose two challenges for our model:</p><p>1.

For p = 2.5, however, this approximation breaks down at low core masses, as we show in §6.</p><p>2. As little as half of the atmosphere's luminosity is generated in the innermost convective layer when radiative windows exist. We must therefore check that our assumption of constant L does not substantially change the structure of the atmosphere in the region of the radiative windows. Fortunately, these radiative windows are either very narrow compared to the height of the convective regions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref>, middle panel), or have ad ≈ ≈ rad throughout, which makes the distinction between convective and radiative layers less pronounced ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17, bottom panel)</ref>. This implies that the entropy drop across the radiative windows is small. We investigate the luminosity structure in greater detail in Appendix C and conclude that our model remains a reasonably good approximation even in the presence of radiative windows.</p><p>We thus find that our atmospheric and cooling model is valid in our regions of interest, with some exceptions discussed in §6.</p></div>

This approach contrasts with that of models which assume high planetesimal accretion rates and find that the atmosphere is in steady state and solely heated due to accretion of solids. In both cases, as the envelope and core become comparable in mass, hydrostatic balance no longer holds and runaway gas accretion commences. For fast accretion, M crit is uniquely defined as the maximum core mass for which the atmosphere is still in hydrostatic equilibrium for a fixed planetesimal accretion rate and a set of disk conditions. In this section we compare our results for M crit to analogous results from steady-state fast planetesimal accretion calculations. We discuss the core accretion rates that are necessary for our regime to be valid in §7.1. In §7.2, we estimate core growth at the maximum rate for which the KH regime is valid, and show it is negligible over the timescale on which the atmosphere evolves. Finally, we compare our results with those assuming fast planetesimal accretion in §7.3.</p></div>

Since analytic studies of critical core masses at high planetesimal accretion rates assume an ideal gas EOS, for ease of comparison we choose an ideal gas polytropic EOS with constant adiabatic gradient ad = 2/7 and mean molecular weight µ = 2.35 (see also Paper I). For this choice of parameters, the runaway accretion time is t run ∼ 1.4 Myrs, which is within the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. We also estimate two reference accretion rates. The first one is the core accretion rate ˙ M c,acc needed to grow the core to M c = 10M ⊕ on the same timescale as our model atmosphere, τ = 1.4 Myrs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">˙ M c,acc (M c ) ∼ M c τ .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The second reference planetesimal accretion rate is ˙ M c,Hill , a typically assumed planetesimal accretion rate for which the random velocities of the planetesimals are of the order of the Hill velocity around the protoplanetary core (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Goldreich et al. 2004</ref>).

Had the core accreted planetesimals at the ˙ M c,KH rate since it started forming, it could not have grown large enough to attract an atmosphere within a typical disk lifetime. Our model requires that the planetesimal accretion rate is initially large during core growth, then significantly reduces as the gaseous envelope accumulates, as suggested by, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pollack et al. (1996)</ref>. This is a plausible scenario: the core's feeding zone may be depleted of solids if it is not refilled by radial drift of planetesimals through the nebula, or the core may form in the inner part of the disk and later be scattered outwards by other giants in the system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ida et al. 2013</ref>).  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Various accretion rates for a planet forming at 30 AU and with a core mass Mc = 10M ⊕ , using a polyropic EOS and ISM power-law opacity.

The core accretion rate ˙ Mc,acc (dashed green) necessary to grow the core on the timescale trun is larger than ˙ M c,KH (dotted red), the maximum planetesimal accretion rate during KH contraction for which our regime is valid (see text). The frequently used planetesimal accretion rate ˙ M c,Hill (dashed-dotted light blue) for which the random velocity of the planetesimals is given by the Hill velocity due to the core (see text), also exceeds ˙ M c,KH .This motivates our requirement that planetesimal accretion must have slowed down after core growth for our model to be valid.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Comparison with Steady-State Results</head><p>We compare our results for M crit with those of studies that assume large planetesimal accretion rates. In principle, the disk lifetime could be short enough that our calculated M crit could exceed the M crit estimated for a steady-state, accretion-heated core. This prospect is not self-contradictory since at higher luminosity, an atmosphere evolves more quickly and hence reaches steady state on a timescale shorter than our calculated KH contraction time. We show here that disk lifetimes are long enough that this is not the case. Our model yields lower core masses than those found when fast planetesimal accretion is considered.</p><p>The critical core mass is larger for higher planetesimal accretion, as additional heating increases the core mass required for collapse. As such, if atmosphere collapse does not occur for the lowest value of ˙ M c,KH over the course of the atmosphere's growth, then it can only occur in the KH dominated regime.</p><p>In order to estimate the critical core mass M crit,KH corresponding to planetesimal accretion at the rate ˙ M c,KH , we use the results of R06 for low luminosity atmospheres forming in the outer disk ( 2 − 5 AU). R06 assumes an ideal gas polytropic EOS and an opacity lower than that of the ISM (see Equation 8). For comparison, we calculate M crit for an ideal gas polytrope and an opacity, κ, given by Equation 8 with F κ reduced by a factor of 100. This choice is comparable to the opacity law used by R06. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Following R06, we find that the critical core mass when accretion luminosity dominates the evolution of the atmosphere can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">M crit,KH ∼ min[ ˙ M c,KH (M c )] 64π 2 C κ σG 3 1 R c M 1/3 c k B µm p<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where C is an order unity constant depending on the adiabatic gradient and disk properties (see R06, Equation B3).

The result is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>; <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The power-law opacity of R06 is scaled to the (semimajor axis dependent) disk temperature, while our opacity is scaled to an absolute reference temperature.

SUMMARY In this paper we study the formation of giant planets embedded in a gas disk. We consider atmospheric evolution around fully grown cores and determine the minimum (critical) core mass, M crit , required to form a gas giant during the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. We improve the model developed in <ref type="bibr">Piso &amp; Youdin (2014, hereafter Paper I)</ref> by including realistic equation of state (EOS) tables and dust opacities.</p><p>For a realistic EOS with the molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) spin isomers in thermal equilibrium, and grain growth opacity with maximum particle size s max = 1 cm and a power-law size distribution (11) with p = 3.5, M crit is ∼8M ⊕ at 5 AU in our fiducial disk and drops to ∼5M ⊕ at 100 AU. The realistic EOS and grain growth opacity have two competing effects on M crit :</p><p>1. Realistic EOS effects increase M crit by a factor of ∼2 when compared to the ideal gas polytrope, for an equilibrium ratio of ortho-and parahydrogen.</p><p>If the H 2 spin isomers are in a fixed 3:1 ratio, M crit increases by a factor of ∼2 − 4 when compared to the polytrope. This increase is most significant at larger stellocentric distances, where disk temperatures are lower than the peak ortho-to-para conversion temperature of ∼50 K.</p><p>2. Grain growth opacities decrease M crit by a factor of ∼3.5 at 5 AU and by a factor of ∼1.2 at 100 AU, when compared to ISM opacities, for a particle distribution given by the power-law (11) with p = 3.5 and a maximum particle size of 1 cm. The critical core mass is less sensitive to the location in the disk when realistic opacities are used. If p = 2.5, an approximation for coagulation, M crit further reduces by up to an order of magnitude.</p><p>In our core accretion models, the dissociation of molecular hydrogen slows the atmospheric cooling and gas accretion rate. This finding is somewhat surprising because H 2 dissociation can trigger the gravitational collapse of protostellar or planetary mass gas clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bodenheimer et al. 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Inutsuka 2012</ref>. The presence of a massive solid core is the key factor that prevents dissociation from inducing a global collapse in our models.</p><p>Our results yield lower core masses than analogous results that consider high planetesimal accretion rates for which the core and atmosphere grow simultaneously. It is thus possible to form a giant planet from a smaller core if the core grows first, then the accretion rate of solids is reduced and a gaseous envelope is accumulated. Moreover, since additional heat sources such as planetesimal accretion limit the ability of the atmosphere to cool and undergo Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, our results represent a true minimum on the core mass needed to form a giant planet during the typical lifetime of a protoplanetary disk.</p><p>We thank the referee for a helpful report.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EQUATION OF STATE TABLE EXTENSION</head><p>In this study we consider atmosphere growth in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks (5 &lt; a &lt; 100 AU), where temperature and pressure drop to as little as T ∼ 20 K and P ∼ 4 × 10 −6 dyn cm −2 for our fiducial disk model (see equations 1b and 1c). We model the nebular gas using the EOS tables of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref>. However, these tables only cover the relatively high temperature and pressure ranges 2.1 &lt; log 10 T (K) &lt; 7.06 and 4.0 &lt; log 10 P (dyn cm −2 ) &lt; 19.0. We thus need to extend the tables to lower T and P . We calculate ad for 1.0 &lt; log 10 T &lt; 2.1 (A1) −5.4 &lt; log 10 P &lt; 4.0 (A2) using the following method.</p><p>Hydrogen Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kittel et al. (1981)</ref>, we calculate ad from the partition function for the internal energy of a system of hydrogen gas molecules (see also D'Angelo &amp; Bodenheimer 2013 for EOS calculations that take into account hydrogen isomers). We begin by writing the partition function Z of a gas molecule of mass m as the product of the partition functions associated with each type of internal energy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Z = Z t Z r Z v , (A3)</formula><p>where Z t , Z r , Z v are associated with translation, rotation, and vibration, respectively. 8 In the classical limit, the molecule's center of mass motion generates</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">Z t = (mk B T /2π 2 ) 3/2 V, (A4)</formula><p>where T and V are the gas temperature and volume, respectively, and is the reduced Planck constant. The rotational partition function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Z r = ∞ j=0 (2j + 1) exp −j(j + 1)Θ r T , (A5)</formula><p>where the characteristic temperature for rotational motion Θ r ≈ 85 K for hydrogen. However, molecular hydrogen occurs in two isomeric forms: parahydrogen with a symmetric (even) rotational wavefunction, and orthohydrogen with an antisymmetric (odd) wavefunction (see Section 3). The rotational partition functions for ortho-and parahydrogen are thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Z r,para = ∞ j=0 1 + (−1) j 2 (2j + 1) exp − j(j + 1)Θ r T (A6)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">Z r,ortho = 3 ∞ j=0 1 − (−1) j 2 (2j + 1) exp − j(j + 1)Θ r T . (A7)</formula><p>The factor of 3 in Equation (A7) accounts for the three-fold degeneracy of the ortho state. In thermal equilibrium, the spin isomers have a combined partition function Z r = Z r,ortho + Z r,para , which can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">Z r = ∞ j=0 (2 − (−1) j )(2j + 1) exp −j(j + 1)Θ r T . (A8)</formula><p>For a fixed 3:1 ortho-to-para ratio, the combined partition function is</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">Z r = Z 1/4 r,para Z 3/4</formula><p>r,ortho . In our range of temperatures of interest, we find that Z r converges after about 25 terms in the series, for both the equilibrium and 3:1 cases.</p><p>Note that Z r,ortho → 0 and Z r,para → 1 as T → 0. This is inconsistent with a fixed 3:1 ortho-to-para ratio, since Z r,ortho → 0 implies that there is no orthohydrogen in the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boley et al. (2007)</ref> and D <ref type="bibr">'Angelo &amp; Bodenheimer (2013)</ref> ensure that this requirement is not violated by using a normalized orthohydrogen partition function, Z r,ortho = Z r,ortho exp(2θ r /T ), which reduces the energy of the lowest rotational state for orthohydrogen from 2k B θ r per molecule to zero. This decreases the total internal energy of the system by a constant factor, but does not change c v , ad , or the relative internal energies of static atmospheric profiles, and therefore does not affect atmospheric evolution. Finally, the partition function for vibrational motion is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Z v = [1 − exp (θ v /T )] −1 , (A9)</formula><p>where the characteristic temperature for vibrational motion is θ v ≈ 6140 K for hydrogen. For a system of N particles of mass m, the partition function of the ensemble is Z N = (1/N !)Z N . Given Z N as a function of (V, T ), the internal energy per mass, entropy per mass and specific heat capacity can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">u = RT 2 ∂ ln Z ∂T V (A10) S = R ln Z + u T − R N ln N ! (A11) c V = ∂u ∂T V . (A12)</formula><p>Note that, following the convention of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref>, we use S to denote entropy per mass ([S] =erg K −1 g −1 ).</p><p>Since Z = Z t Z r Z v , we may write u = u t + u r + u v and S = S t + S r + S v , where variables subscripted t, r, and v are the quantities corresponding to the individual translation, rotation and vibration partition functions, respectively. We include the term R/N ln N ! from Equation (A11) in S t . In the temperature regime for which the rotational states of H 2 are selectively occupied, the total number of particles in the system is constant and we may use the ideal gas law, P = ρRT . With Equations (A10), (A11), and Stirling's approximation, ln N ! ≈ N ln N − N , the resulting entropy per mass due to translational motion is</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">S t = R 5 2 ln T − ln P + ln (2π) 3/2 R 5/2 m 4 h 3 + 5 2 (A13)</formula><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(A13)</ref> is known as the Sackur-Tetrode formula. The internal energy per mass due to translational motion is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">u t = 3 2 RT (A14)</formula><p>Putting all of the above together, we can now evaluate the thermodynamic quantities needed to extend the <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al.

The logarithmic derivatives S T and S P are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">S T = ∂ ln S ∂ ln T P (A15)</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">S P = ∂ ln S ∂ ln P T (A16)</formula><p>We calculate S T and S P through finite differencing.</p><p>5. Adiabatic gradient ad . The adiabatic gradient is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">ad = ∂ ln T ∂ ln P S = − S P S T (A17)</formula><p>We evaluate ad from the tabulated values for S T and S P determined above. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows a contour plot of ad as a function of temperature and pressure for the extended EOS table for hydrogen, assuming thermal equilibrium between the spin isomers. For the 3:1 ortho-to-para ratio, ad decreases continuously with T for T 200 K, in contrast with the equilibrium case, in which ad sharply decreases, then increases as T goes down.</p><p>Our extension is only valid for T 2000 K, since it does not take into account hydrogen dissociation. We choose T = 1500 K as a conservative temperature cutoff. While we account for vibrational motion for completeness, its contribution is negligible in the temperature regime of interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> do not compute the EOS at very high pressures, since hydrogen is solid or may form a Coulomb lattice in this regime, and thus their EOS treatment is no longer valid. While the boundaries of the region in which the free-energy EOS treatment fails can be determined from fundamental thermodynamic constraints, such calculations are not the object of this work. Instead, we choose as boundary a constant entropy curve (log(S) = 8.4) above the region in which the <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> model fails. The expressions derived above are sufficient to give good results for the colored regions of the extended map, which fully cover the temperature and pressures ranges required by our models.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>.-Contour plot of the hydrogen adiabatic gradient ad as a function of gas temperature and pressure.

The dissociation energy depends on the dissociation fraction x (i.e., the fraction of molecules that have dissociated), which can be found from the Saha equation (see e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kippenhahn &amp; Weigert 1990, Chapter 14)</ref> as a function of temperature and density,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">x 2 1 − x ∝ T 3/2 ρ e −χ/k B T ,<label>(B1)</label></formula><p>where χ=4.48 eV is the dissociation energy for molecular hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blanksby &amp; Ellison 2003)</ref>. The above also holds true for ionization, with the dissociation energy replaced by ionization energy χ = 13.6 eV for atomic hydrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mandl 1989)</ref>. From the Saha equation one can find an expression for ρ as a function of T and x, then derive the adiabatic gradient directly from its definition (Equation 4), taking into account the fact that the mean 10 -4 10 -2 10 0 10 2 10 <ref type="bibr">4</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>.-Same as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> but for pure helium. Helium ionizes at T 10, 000 K, but behaves as an ideal monatomic gas otherwise. We choose T = 7, 000 K as a conservative temperature cutoff above which our extension is no longer valid (masked in white). The EOS has not been computed in the lower-right region of the plot (see text). molecular weight in the ideal gas law varies with x, hence the pressure will not only be a function of T and ρ but also of x (see <ref type="bibr">Kippenhahn &amp; Weigert 1990, Chapter 14.</ref>3 for a detailed derivation). The final expression for the adiabatic gradient during ionization is</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">ad = 2 + x(1 − x)Φ H 5 + x(1 − x)Φ 2 H ,<label>(B2)</label></formula><p>with Φ H ≡ 5 2 + χ k B T . The derivation of ad during dissociation is more involved mathematically (see, e.g., Vardya 1960) and leads to a slightly more complicated final expression,</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">ad = 1 + x + x(1−x 2 ) 2 χ k B T 5x + 7(1−x) 2 + x(1−x 2 ) 2 χ k B T 2 .<label>(B3)</label></formula><p>Using Equation (B3), we recover ad = 2/7 for x = 0 (no ongoing dissociation hence hydrogen is purely molecular and diatomic) and ad = 2/5 for x = 1 (hydrogen is fully dissociated into atoms and hence monatomic). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the dependence of ad on the dissociation fraction, for T = 3000 K, the temperature at which dissociation typically occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Langmuir 1912</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adiabatic Gradient during Conversion of Spin Isomers</head><p>The adiabatic gradient scales as ad ∼ 1/c V . The translational component of the heat capacity, c V,t = 3R/2, is independent of temperature. As c V,r increases, ad declines. We can therefore understand how conversion between spin isomers affects ad by studying the dependence on temperature of c V,r of the ortho-para mixture.</p><p>The internal energy per unit mass and specific heat capacity associated with rotation for the individual isomers, for the equilibrium mixture, and for a fixed ortho-para ratio of 3:1 can be derived from their partition functions (see Appendix A for details), and are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> (after Farkas 1935, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. At low temperatures, parahydrogen is in the j = 0 state and has no rotational energy, while orthohydrogen is in the j = 1 state and has the energy of its first rotational level. Both para-and orthohydrogen, as well as their equilibrium mixture, behave like monatomic gases at low temperatures and thus have zero rotational heat capacity. This is consistent with ad = 2/5 at low temperatures as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. As the temperature increases, the energetically higher-lying rotational states of para-and orthohydrogen are populated and the heat capacity of both spin isomers increases as a result. We note that the heat capacity of the equilibrium mixture is not a weighted average of the heat capacities of the individual components because it takes into account both the rotational energy uptake of para-and orthohydrogen, and also the shift in their equilibrium concentrations with temperature. This results in a peak in the heat capacity of the mixture around ∼50 K, as seen in the bottom plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>. It follows that the adiabatic gradient has to reduce, reach a minimum, then increase as the temperature rises, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In contrast, the heat capacity for the 3:1 ortho-para ratio mixture will be a weighted average between the individual ortho-and para-components, and will hence have intermediate values between the two, as displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>.  .-Internal energy per unit mass and specific heat capacity associated with rotation for parahydrogen (dashed blue), orthohydrogen (dotted green), the equilibrium mixture (solid red) and a fixed 3:1 ortho-to-para ratio (dash-dotted light blue) as a function of temperature.

This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> for a gas density ρ = 10 −8 g cm −3 , which is typical for the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. <ref type="bibr">Semenov</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref>.-Evolution of the luminosity and elapsed time during atmospheric growth around a 8M ⊕ core at 100 AU, for a realistic EOS with hydrogen spin isomers in thermal equilibrium (solid line), and with a fixed ortho-to-para ratio 3:1 (dashed line). The assumption of a fixed ortho-to-para ratio increases the runaway accretion time trun by a factor of ∼3 compared to the equilibrium mixture. o (2003) calculate Rosseland mean opacities in protoplanetary disks for grains of different sizes and structure. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>, their results are in good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell &amp; Lin (1994)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Semenov et al. (2003)</ref> do not take grain growth into account, which is likely to occur in protoplanetary disks, particularly at the late times when cores form. D' <ref type="bibr">Alessio et al. (2001)</ref> compute wavelength dependent opacities for a range of maximum particle sizes and different size distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> shows the integrated Rosseland mean opacity for a maximum particle size of 1 cm and a power law differential size distribution dN/ds ∝ s −p , with s the grain size and p = 3.5 for a standard collisional cascade and p = 2.5 when coagulation is taken into account. We see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref> that this yields a mean opacity that is both lower and less sensitive to temperature, when compared to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell &amp; Lin (1994)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Semenov et al. (2003)</ref>. However, D' <ref type="bibr">Alessio et al. (2001)</ref> only computes opacities for temperatures less than the dust sublimation temperature, appropriate for current observations of dust in protoplanetary disks. As we see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>, the opacity dramatically decreases during dust sublimation. We thus use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell &amp; Lin (1994)</ref> opacities for T 1000 K, ensuring that they smoothly match the D' <ref type="bibr">Alessio et al. (2001)</ref> opacities for lower temperatures. The significant opacity drop due to the sublimation of ice and metal grains lowers the radiative temperature gradient rad , which may result in one or more inner radiative layers inside the atmosphere of a protoplanet. This is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref>: depending on the semimajor axis and core mass, the opacity drop will generate no radiative window (top panel), one radiative window (middle panel), or two radiative windows (bottom panel).</p><p>Our idealization of a constant L with radius may be challenged by the presence of radiative windows. While the structure of convective regions is unaffected by L, the structure of radiative windows depends on L. Fortunately, the assumption of constant luminosity remains reasonable if most of the luminosity is generated in the innermost convective region of the envelope. We can check whether this is true a posteriori by using the local energy equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">∂L ∂m = −T ∂S ∂t ,<label>(C1)</label></formula><p>and integrating it between M c and M RCB1 , where RCB 1 is the innermost RCB. This luminosity can be as little as half of the assumed fixed atmospheric luminosity L. a max =1 cm, p=2.5 a max =1 cm, p=3.5</p></div>
