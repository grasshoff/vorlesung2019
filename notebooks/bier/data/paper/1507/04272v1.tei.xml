			<abstract>
				<p>The space mission PLATO will usher in a new era of exoplanetary science by expanding our current inventory of transiting systems and constraining host star ages, which are currently highly uncertain. This capability might allow PLATO to detect changes in planetary system architecture with time, particularly because planetary scattering due to Lagrange instability may be triggered long after the system was formed. Here, we utilize previously published instability timescale prescriptions to determine PLATO&apos;s capability to detect a trend of decreasing planet frequency with age for systems with equal-mass planets. For two-planet systems, our results demonstrate that PLATO may detect a trend for planet masses which are at least as massive as super-Earths. For systems with three or more planets, we link their initial compactness to potentially detectable frequency trends in order to aid future investigations when these populations will be better characterized.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Nearly all exoplanets orbit stars whose ages are poorly constrained. This situation is unfortunate because the potential to learn about the dynamical evolution of planetary systems through the host star's evolution has yet to be realized. Accurate stellar ages may provide key constraints and insights on the formation and fate of planets.</p><p>Tidally-influenced, hot exoplanets highlight the importance of this link. Hundreds of confirmed planets have orbital periods less than 10 days, where tidal interactions between the planet and star can affect the planet's orbital parameters in a myriad of ways (e.g. see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ogilvie 2014</ref>). Because the timescales for shrinking an orbit are sensitively dependent on the orbital period, accurate stellar ages would crucially constrain the dynamical histories of these systems. Further, the details of tidal theory are controversial and recent analyses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Efroimsky &amp; Makarov 2013</ref>) demonstrate the dangers of adopting the heretofore widely-used constant quality factor. Adding stellar age to the list of known system parameters would enable greater resolution on this topic.</p><p>However, the insights obtained from accurate stellar ages are not restricted to substellar companions with such close orbits. Single planets or brown dwarfs which ⋆ E-mail: d.veras@warwick.ac.uk are out of the reach of stellar tides (with semimajor axes beyond about 0.1 au) but within the ellipsoid of the gravitational influence of the parent star within the Milky Way (within about 10 5 au) could attain currently-observed orbital properties from (i) a relic planet formation process such as core accretion, gravitational instability or disc migration (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baruteau et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Helled et al. 2013</ref>, for recent reviews), (ii) a relic star formation process such as star-planet scattering in birth clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pfahl &amp; Muterspaugh 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spurzem et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Malmberg et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Parker &amp; Quanz 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hao et al. 2013</ref>), (iii) gravitational interaction with other planets during a star's main sequence lifetime (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davies et al. 2014</ref>, for a recent review) or/and (iv) perturbations from Galactic field star flybys <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zakamska &amp; Tremaine 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fregeau et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boley et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Veras &amp; Moeckel 2012)</ref> and Galactic tides <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Heisler &amp; Tremaine 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brasser 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Veras &amp; Evans 2013)</ref>.</p><p>All these processes are time-dependent and hence could benefit from accurate stellar ages. Techniques are being developed to constrain stellar ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lebreton &amp; Goupil 2014)</ref> to within 10 per cent of a typical main sequence lifetime of a Solar-mass star by utilizing astroseismology. Although these techniques can be applied to high-precision photometric data taken from the CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baglin et al. 2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ke- pler (Borucki et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Koch et al. 2010</ref>) space missions, the number of suitable stars from these missions is just a handful.</p><p>The PLATO space mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>), due for launch in 2024, will achieve similarly tight age constraints, but for a much larger sample of stars. One of the main aims of PLATO is to achieve 10% precision in the age of 20,000 main sequence stars of spectral types F5-K7. In order to achieve this goal, PLATO will produce internal stellar mass distributions for different stars by combining radius measurements derived from Gaia data with the oscillation frequencies observed in the PLATO light curves.</p><p>Other techniques which will be used to derive stellar ages, such as gyrochronology, will be assessed and calibrated from this "primary" sample and then applied to the hundreds of thousands of main sequence stars that PLATO will observe during the course of its 6 year mission (albeit at a lower age precision). Moreover, PLATO will, for the primary sample, allow for direct testing of stellar evolution tracks.</p><p>Such a large sample will enable us to detect trends in exoplanetary science that remain currently hidden in the noise. One of these trends is frequency of planets versus main sequence age. Not all systems with multiple planets will remain stable over their main sequence lifetimes. In our own Solar system, Mercury has a one to few per cent chance of destabilizing the inner planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Laskar &amp; Gastineau 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zeebe 2015</ref>). Other systems are closer to instability; Section 6.3 of Veras et al. (2013) discuss specific examples for planets discovered by Doppler radial velocity with semimajor axes that exceed 1 au. Overall, the frequency of planets might decrease with time.</p><p>The trend for planets detected by transit photometry within 1 au but beyond the limit at which tidal forces cease to become significant (at about 0.1 au) should not be qualitatively different. On 9 Jul 2015, the Exoplanets Data Explorer (http://exoplanets.org) listed 509 substellar objects in this semimajor axis range that are components of multiple-planet systems. Overall, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fang &amp; Margot (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballard &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref> both estimate that about half of Kepler systems are multiple-planet systems, the latter considering only M dwarfs. Seven examples of potential planets in multi-planet systems are the seven candidate planets of KIC 11442793, all of which transit between 0.074 au and 1.0 au but do not have measured masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cabrera et al. 2014</ref>). In fact, those authors conclude that the two outermost candidates are indeed planets due to dynamical stability constraints on their masses, highlighting how close to instability some of these systems might reside.</p><p>In this brief paper, we combine stability prescriptions from previous investigations with the detection capabilities of the PLATO mission. Section 2 identifies these prescriptions and Section 3 performs the analysis. We conclude in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">STABILITY OF PLANETARY SYSTEMS</head><p>Two-planet systems represent a robust starting point with which to study decreasing planet frequency with time along the main sequence. Observers have identified hundreds of these systems, and theorists have established analytical constraints which would otherwise be unattainable with additional planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Two-planet stability</head><p>A two-planet system is a generally-unsolvable threebody problem. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marchal &amp; Saari (1975)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marchal &amp; Bozis (1982)</ref> identified allowable regions of motion in this problem based on the angular momentum and energy of the system. This categorization proved particularly valuable after the confident discovery of extrasolar planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wolszczan &amp; Frail 1992</ref>) for assessing their stability. Many subsequent studies, summarized in Georgakarakos (2008), considered relevant special cases and extensions.</p><p>The allowable regions of motions are partially partitioned by the concept of Hill stability. Two planets are said to be Hill stable if their orbits never cross. This requirement does not preclude the inner planet from crashing into the star, nor the outer planet from escaping from the system. If the planets do remain ordered and do not suffer a collision nor ejection, then the system is said to be Lagrange stable. In Hill unstable cases, when the initial orbits do cross, then the outcome is uncertain: the system could destabilize or alternatively the planets might remain inside of a mean motion resonance (like Neptune and Pluto). This latter possibility presupposes the planets were originally captured into a resonance, most likely due to protoplanetary disc dissipation, but not necessarily ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Raymond et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, in most cases (as a fraction of available parameter space), planets which cross orbits will become violently unstable. In this respect, the critical separation ∆H 1 of the initial planetary orbits that determines the Hill stability boundary has occasionally been treated, erroneously, as a type of global stability boundary. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marzari (2014)</ref> has demonstrated why Hill stability should not be treated as a global boundary through a frequency map analysis. In some cases though, the Hill stability boundary may be considered a dividing line between "quick instability" and "slow instability". This notion may be carried further: one can then define a Lagrange stability boundary ∆L &gt; ∆H beyond which Lagrange instability does not occur, or occurs on a timescale which exceeds the main sequence stellar lifetime.</p><p>The lack of quantification in these statements results from a dearth of dedicated studies of Lagrange instability. We summarize previous investigations as follows: Chapter 11 of Marchal (1990), Anosova (1996) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Li et al. (2009)</ref> focused on the escape of the outer body; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kholshevnikov &amp; Kuznetsov (2011)</ref> considered the mass dependence; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deck et al. (2013)</ref> linked Lagrange instability (albeit defined slightly differently) with mean motion resonance overlap; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes &amp; Greenberg (2006</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raymond et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kopparapu &amp; Barnes (2010)</ref>,  and  evaluated the extent of Lagrange instability beyond the Hill stability limit. Recently Petrovich (2015) unveiled a fairly general Lagrange instability criterion for two unequal-mass, highly eccentric and nearly coplanar planets that performs significantly better than previous widely-used criteria from stellar dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eggleton &amp; Kiseleva 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mardling &amp; Aarseth 2001)</ref>. Although excellent analytic approximations to ∆H exist (Donnison 2011), the same is not true for ∆L. One must Exoplanet frequency with PLATO 3 find ∆L empirically through simulations. However, simulations have revealed that this Lagrange stability boundary is nebulous.  found that although ∆L is difficult to constrain, the minimum time to Lagrange instability is well-established empirically as a function of planet mass only, for equal-mass planets. They defined the Lagrange instability timescale as the time at which either the inner planet collided with the stellar surface or when the outer planet's orbit became hyperbolic. If xuns represents the minimum number of initial orbits of the inner planet before the onset of Lagrange instability, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log 10 (xuns) ∼ (5.23 ± 0.04) µ MJ/M⊙ −0.181±0.003 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where µ is the planet/star mass ratio, for both planets, and MJ is the mass of Jupiter. This formula appears to hold true for any separation in-between ∆H and ∆L, for, at least, orbits with initial eccentricities less than 0.3, and is valid for both planets and brown dwarfs. The equation is based on a fit down to masses of 0.1MJ, and will be used directly in conjunction with PLATO sensitivities in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Stability of three or more planets</head><p>In systems with three or more planets, there is no known analytical constraint on Hill stability, and the distinction between Hill instability and Lagrange instability is rarely asserted. Instead, researchers have relied on empirical fits to N -body simulations to help characterize the potential future stability of a system. Analytical motivation for establishing these fits is also rare. For an exception, see Section 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Zhou et al. (2007)</ref>, who demonstrate how an analytical treatment from first principles can reproduce the same scalings obtained from their empirical fits. The functional form predominately chosen for the global instability fit for three or more planets is equivalent to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chambers et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smith &amp; Lissauer 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Funk et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pu &amp; Wu 2015)</ref> log 10 (xuns) ∼ bβ + c, , overall if β is too small, then the system will become unstable almost immediately. Alternatively, if β is too large, the system will not experience instability during the star's main sequence lifetime.</p><p>Like Equation (1), Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> is applicable only for equal-mass planets. However, Equation (2) is more versatile, having been applied to systems with for example 3, 5, 10 and even 20 planets. The unequal-planet mass case greatly increases the available phase space to explore, and has sofar largely been ignored (we do so here as well). Although Equation (2) may be more versatile, this general form does not appear to constrain stability as well as Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, because the latter is for the specific case of two equal-mass planets.</p><p>Whereas β typically represents a variable user-defined proxy for initial separations, the values of b and c are considered to be fixed and are computed only after a suite of N -body simulations has finished running. Both the number of planets as well as the planet mass / star mass ratio under the assumption of initially circular orbits sets both b and c; these values might also be weakly dependent on a1 and on β. In fact, the LHS of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> is more often expressed as an unscaled time.</p><p>The wide applicability of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> for systems with at least three planets is useful for our purposes. Although that equation does not let us directly relate PLATO sensitivities with planetary mass, as in the two-planet case, the relation provides an indirect pathway to do so depending on the architecture a reader might consider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LINK WITH PLATO</head><p>Assume that PLATO will be able to constrain a star's age to ∆tPLATO, such that PLATO will be able to distinguish (tMS/∆tPLATO) time bins over a star's main sequence lifetime tMS. At the level of approximation we are aiming for, we need not require that the number of time bins is an integer, and may also treat ∆tPLATO as constant in time.

Further, we consider 9 different main sequence stellar masses (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5M⊙), corresponding to the range in which asteroseismology with PLATO can be effective at constraining stellar ages. Because we are interested only in Lagrange instability on the main sequence 2 , we must compute the main sequence lifetime tMS of these stars. To do so, we use the sse code <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hurley et al. 2000)</ref>, and assume Solar metallicity. We obtain tMS = 10948, 7646, 5607, 4237, 3355, and 2716 Myr for M⋆ = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5M⊙, respectively. The lower mass stars are on the main sequence for a duration greater than the current age of the Universe. Consequently, for added clarity, we do not draw curves in the figures of this paper for the 0.8M⊙ and 0.9M⊙ tracks, as they are so similar to the 0.7M⊙ track.</p></div>

For a significant proportion of these planets, stellar activity signals will complicate the determination of their masses. However, by just crudely binning observations, PLATO will be able to recover many of these systems.

Alternatively, β can never be too small, because the resulting quick instabilities will be included in the first time bin.</p><p>If we exclude this time bin, then the result is the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. In this panel, the quantity (bβ + c) is restricted to just about a few; too small of a range to even encompass the different fits from multiple authors to instability timescales in a similar region of parameter space (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pu &amp; Wu 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, and despite large phase space of systems with three or more planets, we can make some concrete statements. Consider the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smith &amp; Lissauer (2009)</ref>, whose equation 6 is in the same form as our Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> and who derive sets of (b, c) based on extensive suites of N -body numerical integrations. They found that for 5-planet systems where µ = 3.0035×10 −6 (corresponding to Earth-mass planets orbiting a Solar-mass star), (b, c) = (1.012, −1.686) holds for 3.4 β 8. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>. These values correspond to (bβ + c) ≈ {1.8, 6.8}, lower than the ranges presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Consequently, instabilities produced from that setup would occur within the first time bin.</p><p>Smith &amp; Lissauer (2009) also considered many other system types; for systems with three Earth-mass planets, they fit values of (b, c) = (1.496, −3.142) for β 3.0, which would give (bβ +c) ≈ {10, 11, 12} for β ≈ {8. <ref type="bibr">78, 9.45, 10.12}</ref>. These values of β would place the systems in other time bins (besides the first). Comparing their 5-planet and 3-planet fits in their <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref> reveals that the functional form of the fit might change for β 8.5. Quantifying how, even for just the equal-mass case, is difficult because of computational limitations. Using N -body simulations to predict the very long term (∼Gyrs) evolution of transiting planets (such as those which will be discovered by PLATO) pose an additional challenge because their semimajor axes would be on the scale of hundredths or tenths of an au (whereas Smith &amp; Lissauer 2009 adopted a1 = 1 au).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SUMMARY</head><p>Compared to previous experiments, the PLATO space mission will significantly improve robust stellar age estimates by developing separate internal mass distributions for thousands of individual stars. Consequently, PLATO will unveil currently undetectable trends in planetary systems. In this work, we demonstrated one such potential trend: decreasing planetary frequency with main sequence age for marginally unstable equal-mass multi-planet systems. For two-planet systems, this trend could be most secure for planetary masses which are on the order of ten Earth masses, well within PLATO's planet detection capabilities. Detection of this trend could also help constrain formation mechanisms and test the theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Pu &amp; Wu 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Volk &amp; Gladman 2015</ref>) that tightly packed inner planets were more prevalent in the initial stages of the lifetime of planetary systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>although slight variations exist (Faber &amp; Quillen 2007; Zhou et al. 2007; Chatterjee et al. 2008; Quillen 2011; Mustill et al. 2014). In equation (2), b and c are fit- ted constants and β refers to the number of mutual Hill radii by which consecutive pairs of planets are sepa- rated. A mutual Hill radius is a distance that is not de- fined uniformly throughout the literature (contrast, e.g., Chambers et al. 1996 and Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002 with Smith &amp; Lissauer 2009, and see the discussion at the end of Section 2 of Mustill et al. 2014). Regardless, ef- fectively, β determines the extent of packing in a plane- tary system (Barnes &amp; Raymond 2004; Barnes et al. 2008; Raymond et al. 2009; Veras &amp; Gänsicke 2015), and can be expressed through masses and semimajor axes. Although the exact definition of β varies (see also the sentence containing equation 5 in Pu &amp; Wu 2015)</figDesc></figure>
