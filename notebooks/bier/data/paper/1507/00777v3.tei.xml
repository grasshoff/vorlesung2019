				<p>Several concepts now exist for small, space-based missions to directly characterize exoplanets in reflected light. While studies have been performed that investigate the potential detection yields of such missions, little work has been done to understand how instrumental and astrophysical parameters will affect the ability of these missions to obtain spectra that are useful for characterizing their planetary targets. Here, we develop an instrument noise model suitable for studying the spectral characterization potential of a coronagraph-equipped, space-based telescope. We adopt a baseline set of telescope and instrument parameters appropriate for near-future planned missions like WFIRST-AFTA, including a 2 m diameter primary aperture, an operational wavelength range of 0.4-1.0 µm, and an instrument spectral resolution of λ/∆λ = 70, and apply our baseline model to a variety of spectral models of different planet types, including Earth twins, Jupiter twins, and warm and cool Jupiters and Neptunes. With 1 Sagan Fellow-2-our exoplanet spectral models, we explore wavelength-dependent planet-star flux ratios for main sequence stars of various effective temperatures, and discuss how coronagraph inner and outer working angle constraints will influence the potential to study different types of planets. For planets most favorable to spectroscopic characterization-cool Jupiters and Neptunes as well as nearby super-Earths-we study the integration times required to achieve moderate signal-to-noise ratio spectra. We also explore the sensitivity of the integration times required to either detect the bottom or presence of key absorption bands (for methane, water vapor, and molecular oxygen) to coronagraph raw contrast performance, exozo-diacal light levels, and the distance to the planetary system. Decreasing detector quantum efficiency at longer visible wavelengths makes the detection of water vapor in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets extremely challenging, and also hinders detections of the 0.89 µm methane band. Additionally, most modeled observations have noise dominated by dark current, indicating that improving CCD performance could substantially drive down requisite integration times. Finally , we briefly discuss the extension of our models to a more distant future Large UV-Optical-InfraRed (LUVOIR) mission.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Exoplanet atmospheric characterization is a rapidly progressing field, and will likely continue on this trajectory as the detection and study of nearby exoplanets was highlighted as one of three main science objectives in the 2010 National Research Council decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Following the first detection of an exoplanet atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Charbonneau et al. 2002)</ref>, secondary eclipse and transit observations have been used to characterize the atmospheres of a number of hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grillmair et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Swain et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Swain et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sing et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2009)</ref>. More recently, observations have begun to probe new categories of planets, including miniNeptune and super-Earth exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Stevenson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bean et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kreidberg et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Knutson et al. 2014a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ehrenreich et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fraine et al. 2014</ref>). Of course, and as with any young field, some findings remain controversial or have undergone substantial revision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Line et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hansen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Diamond-Lowe et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Anticipating future exoplanet direct detection missions, several studies have investigated the detection capabilities of coronagraph or starshade instruments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol (2007)</ref> presented analytic models of the detection efficiency of coronagraph searches and investigated dependencies on key parameters, including survey duration, telescope diameter, and telescope inner working angle (IWA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown &amp; Soummer (2010)</ref> discussed methods for optimizing survey "completeness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">(Brown , 2005</ref>), while other studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Savransky et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turn- bull et al. 2012</ref>) have emphasized techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed missions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mawet et al. (2014)</ref> studied the statistics of high-contrast imaging at small angles, and found that the limited number of resolution elements near to the star (i.e., at 2λ/D) can lead to large errors in contrast estimations and false alarm probabilities computed by less sophisticated methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stark et al. (2014)</ref> presented an improved technique for optimizing exoplanet detection completeness, and explored the dependencies of exo-Earth yield on a number of astrophysical, mission, and instrument parameters. In a follow-up paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stark et al. (2015)</ref> used their completeness model to compute lower limits on the aperture size required to find and characterize a significant number of Earth-twins. Very recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Greco &amp; Burrows (2015)</ref> studied the detection capabilities of a coronagraph-equipped WFIRST-AFTA mission 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spergel et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Technologies and ideas for direct detection and characterization of exoplanets have long been discussed, and there exists a body of white papers and summary documents that outline strategies for direct characterization missions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beichman et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Des Marais et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schneider et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lunine et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cockell et al. 2009)</ref>. Recently, following a growing interest in exoplanet direct detection <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> , NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program commissioned a number of "quick study" reports focused on exoplanet characterization at visible wavelengths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marley et al. (2014)</ref> discussed how reflected light observations could be used to characterize existing radial velocity-detected exoplanets. Hu (2014) studied how direct imaging could constrain methane abundances and cloud properties using low resolution spectra. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows (2014)</ref> explored the diversity of giant exoplanet spectra that may be accessible to a coronagraph-equiped WFIRST-AFTA mission.</p><p>Only a subset of the aforementioned quick studies considered the influence of noise on spectral observations, which, if included, is commonly applied by assuming a constant signalto-noise ratio (SNR) across the entire modeled "observation". While some studies have done extensive modeling of the influence of speckle noise (and techniques for minimizing such noise) on direct exoplanet observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Marois et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sparks &amp; Ford 2002)</ref>, few published studies exist that comprehensively examine how spectral observations are influenced by stellar leakage, zodiacal light, exozodiacal light, and other noise sources. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maire et al. (2012)</ref> investigated how noise would influence the characterization capabilities of the proposed the Spectro-Polarimetric Imaging and Characterization of Exoplanetary Systems (SPICES) mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Boccaletti et al. 2012</ref>). This work included noise due to speckles, exozodiacal light, zodiacal light, and read-out, resulting in a handful of spectral simulations for planet-star systems for a specified distance and integration time. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Leger et al. (2015)</ref> studied design missions for a 2-meter class space-based coronagraph mission and a four-spacecraft formation flying interferometer mission, assuming noise from only stellar leakage and exozodiacal light, with a primary goal of determining how effective such missions would be in studying exo-Earths given new estimates of η ⊕ .</p><p>Here, we build on the limited previous studies of the influence of noise on the ability of space-based coronagraphs to characterize exoplanets. We begin by outlining a framework for modeling noise for such missions, including stellar leakage, exozodiacal light, zodiacal light, dark current, and read noise. We then investigate the capabilities of a 2-meter class mission to observe and study a variety of Jupiter-and Neptune-sized worlds as well as terrestrial exoplanets. Using a characteristic set of mission parameters, we show how expected integration times will scale with wavelength and host star spectral type, and, for key spectral features, we show the sensitivity of these integration times to distance to the star-planet system, exozodiacal light levels, and coronagraph raw contrast performance. Finally, we discuss how our framework extends to the characterization of Earth twins with Large UV-Optical-InfraRed (LUVOIR) telescope missions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model Description</head><p>We consider a space-based telescope of diameter D designed to detect and characterize exoplanets in reflected light. The telescope is equipped with a coronagraph that achieves a raw contrast C (which can, in general, be wavelength-dependent) and has inner and outer working angles of θ IWA and θ OWA , respectively. The planetary light is is distributed into a point spread function (PSF), where an aperture of width (or diameter) Xλ/D is used in the image plane to extract the planetary signal. However, a number of other sources will contribute to the detector counts within the defined aperture, including Solar System zodiacal light, exozodiacal light, leaked stellar light, dark current, and read noise.</p><p>The Appendix contains a presentation of our models of the planet count rate and count rates from key noise sources, which are similar to those of <ref type="bibr">Brown (2005)</ref>. For convenience, a synopsis of all of the model parameters, variables, and outputs are given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Briefly, our planet count rate (c p ), zodiacal light count rate (c z ), exozodiacal light count rate (c ez ), stellar leakage count rate (c lk ), dark current count rate (c D ), and read noise count rate (c R ) are computed using Equations A5, A7, A10, A11, A12, and A21, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Baseline Parameters and Input Data</head><p>It is useful to define a baseline set of astrophysical, telescope, and instrument parameters, though later sections of this paper will explore sensitivity to key variables (e.g., distance, exozodiacal light levels, and coronagraph raw contrast). Baseline astrophysical parameters are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, while telescope and instrument parameters are in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Regarding astrophysical parameters, we adopt the standard, empirically-derived solar spectrum of <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wehrli (1985)</ref>. As mentioned in Section A.2, we use a surface brightness of M z,V = 23 mag arcsec −2 for Solar System zodiacal light. For exozodiacal light, we assume one zodi (i.e., N ez = 1) with a surface brightness of M ez,V = 22 mag arcsec −2 , which is a factor of ∼2 larger than Solar System zodiacal surface brightness, as exozodiacal dust both above and below the midplane contribute ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stark et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>For baseline telescope and instrument parameters, we consider a 2-meter class telescope equipped with a coronagraph designed to achieve a raw contrast of C = 10 −9 between θ IWA = 2λ/D and θ OWA = 10λ/D. The total system throughput is T = 0.05, and we mimic the decreasing sensitivity of CCDs at red wavelengths by parameterizing the quantum efficiency according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q = 0.9, λ ≤ 0.7 µm 0.9 1 − λ−0.7 0.3 , 0.7 µm &lt; λ ≤ 1 µm .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We use a characteristic dark current of 5×10 −4 s −1 and read noise of 0.1. We assume a square aperture width of 1.5λ/D (i.e., X = 1.5), which would be a sensible choice to help eliminate sensitivity to the sub-pixel (or sub-lenslet) location of the planet, whose PSF is sampled at 0.5λ/D. Finally, we assume that the coronagraph is paired with a spectrometer that covers 0.4-1.0 µm at R = 70, which is sufficient to resolve many molecular absorption bands and features throughout the visible wavelength range (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Note that, while a resolution of 70 is small enough to resolve the A-band of molecular oxygen, this may not be the ideal resolution for detecting this band <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brandt &amp; Spiegel 2014</ref>). Overall, our assumed parameters are meant to be representative of either the previously-mentioned WFIRST-AFTA mission or the Exo-C mission concept (see reports linked in the Introduction).</p><p>Our reflectivity data come from a number of different sources. For Earth twins we use the extensively validated Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3-D spectral Earth model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Robinson et al. (2011)</ref>, which realistically simulates wavelength-and phase-dependent spectra of the Pale Blue Dot ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Robinson et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Robinson et al. , 2014</ref>). In certain cases, we investigate super-Earths, which we take to have an Earth-like reflectivity and a radius of 1.5R ⊕ , and Venus twins, with a characteristic reflectivity from the validated models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arney et al. (2014)</ref>. For Jupiter and Neptune twins, we use the observed geometric albedos from <ref type="bibr">Karkoschka (1998)</ref> and a Lambertian phase function given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Φ L (α) = sin α + (π − α) cos α π ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>although realistic planetary phase functions are not perfectly Lambertian (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>, their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15</ref>). Recall that the phase function captures phase-dependent brightness changes as the planet moves through its orbit and that the brightness increase from quadrature to full phase is a factor of ∼3. Finally, we also consider "warm" and "cool" Jupiters and Neptunes, using the wavelength-and phase-dependent models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. (2010)</ref> for both a 0.8 AU and 2 AU (from a Sun-like star) Jupiter and Neptune (at 3× and 30× heavy element enhancement, respectively). All planets are taken to be at a characteristic phase angle of α = π/2 = 90 • (i.e., quadrature).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Noise</head><p>The total number of counts, C tot , is computed from the total count rate using</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C tot = (c p + c z + c ez + c lk + c D + c R ) ∆t exp = (c p + c b ) ∆t exp ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ∆t exp is the exposure time, and we have defined the total background count rate,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c b = c z + c ez + c lk + c D + c R .</formula><p>The total number of background counts would be C b = c b ∆t exp . Following <ref type="bibr">Brown (2005)</ref>, the noise counts are taken as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C noise = C p + 2C b ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>which assumes a background subtraction (e.g., via a spacecraft roll maneuver) is performed to detect the planet (implying that the single exposure photon counting noise limit is not achieved), and C p is the total planet counts. With the signal-to-noise ratio given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">SNR = C p C noise ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>we can compute the exposure time needed to achieve a given SNR by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">∆t exp = c p + 2c b c 2 p SNR 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that the exposure time required to achieve a given SNR is distinct from the SNR required to detect a certain molecule (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brandt &amp; Spiegel 2014)</ref>, or to distinguish between models with different heavy element enhancements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maire et al. 2012</ref>). The former (given by Equation 6), when applied at the bottom of several molecular features (as is done in later sections), is representative of the requisite exposure time for determining molecular abundances and cloud properties for exoplanet atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Marley et al. 2014</ref>). Such determinations require comparisons to cloudy atmospheric models, both at continuum wavelengths and across/in molecular bands, thereby simultaneously retrieving cloud and atmospheric parameters (including the abundances of key species).</p><p>We also explore the integration time required to simply detect a molecular feature by the deviation it causes from a flat continuum, which is sufficient for stating whether or not a certain species is present in an atmosphere. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Misra et al. (2014)</ref>, we write the band SNR by defining the signal as the count difference between the spectral model and a model without absorption, determined by fitting the continuum on both sides of the absorption band. The noise counts are summed over the band. Thus, if c cont is the continuum count rate, then the band SNR is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">SNR band = j c cont,j − c p,j j c p,j + 2c b,j ∆t 1/2 exp ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the sum is over all spectral elements (denoted by sub-script 'j') within the molecular band. Band detection times, in general, will be long for shallow and narrow features, whereas the previously discussed exposure times to reach a given SNR at the bottom of a band is shortest for shallow features. These two times will be roughly equal for a feature that is one resolution element in width and that is moderately deep.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The following subsections explore the detectability of, and integration time required to detect, key spectral features for various categories of planets. We define a planet "type" as having fixed radius, reflectivity [AΦ (α)], and incident flux from its host star. The latter requirement is sometimes referred to as the "flux (or insolation) equivalent distance". Note that we focus on the visible wavelength range (0.4-1.0 µm), as exoplanet characterization in reflected light at near-infrared wavelengths is especially difficult for small telescopes due to IWA constraints.</p><p>To get a sense for the scales involved, we note that an Earth twin around a Sun-like star, using A = 0.2, Φ (π/2) ∼ 1/π, R p = R ⊕ , and r = 1 AU, would have the canonical planet-star flux ratio (from Equation A3) of 10 −10 . Then, assuming our baseline parameters, and using λ = 0.55 µm with a 8 nm-wide bandpass, Equation A5 gives c p ∼ 5 × 10 −4 s −1 (or about 2 hr −1 ) for an Earth twin at 5 pc. By comparison, the leakage count rate is 20 hr −1 for C = 10 −9 , while the zodiacal and exozodiacal light count rates are 2 hr −1 and 4 hr −1 , respectively. With a dark count rate of about 240 hr −1 and a read noise count rate of 10 hr −1 , the exposure time needed to reach SNR = 5 is roughly 5 × 10 3 hr-an unfeasibly long integration time, but which could be reduced by decreasing spectral resolution. For a Jupiter twin at 5 pc, with a geometric albedo of 0.5, the planet-star flux ratio increases to ∼10 −9 , and the planet count rate increases to 20 hr −1 (although this twin, at 5.2 AU from its Sun-like host, would be outside θ OWA = 10λ/D at quadrature) while the exozodiacal light count rate decreases to 0.2 hr −1 . Here, then, the time needed to reach SNR = 5 is only 30 hours.</p><p>As demonstrated by these count rate example calculations, the dominant term in the noise counts (Equation 4)-for a wide range of planet types, distances, stellar effective temperatures, and wavelengths-is dark current. This term is strongly influenced by two parameters: the dark current rate (D e − ) and the width of our assumed photometric aperture (controlled by X). The latter term determines the area used to extract the planetary signal, which leads to a X 2 dependence in the dark noise count rate. For our assumed baseline set of parameters and a characteristic distance of 10 pc, all of the planet types investigated in Section 3.2 and later have dark current as the dominant noise source, leading the exposure times required to achieve a given SNR to scale with the planet count rate as (roughly) c D /c 2 p . Note that this scaling leads to a strong dependence on planetary properties, implying that, for example, observing planets closer to full phase would drive down integration times by as much as an order of magnitude from the estimates provided below (which are given at quadrature phase). Also, the overall importance of dark current in our results below is influenced by our baseline throughput assumption (selected to be consistent with, e.g., WFIRST-AFTA)-improved telescope and instrument throughputs will drive up the planetary signal, while also increasing the relative weights of noise due to stellar leakage and zodiacal and exozodiacal light.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Planet-Star Flux Ratios</head><p>Insight into the complexities associated with directly observing cool exoplanets comes from investigating planet-star flux ratios for our different types of worlds. The first panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the planet-star flux ratio as color contours for a Jupiter-sized world with AΦ (α) = 0.5/π (independent of wavelength) and with a Jupiter-like top-of-atmosphere flux (fixed at F TOA = 50.5 W m −2 ), as a function of main sequence host star effective temperature. As we have assumed a gray reflectivity, the planet-star flux ratio only depends on T eff (assuming a simple relationship between this and R s on the main sequence), with</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F p F s = AΦ (α) F TOA σT 4 eff R p R s 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where the dependence on planetary orbital distance is functionally removed. Here, since the planet flux is fixed by AΦ (α) and F TOA (regardless of stellar effective temperature), the planet-star flux ratio increases for cooler stars as these stars are intrinsically fainter.</p><p>The planet-star flux ratio contours for the gray case in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> tell an incomplete story, however. First, while the results indicate that detecting a Jupiter-sized planet around cool stars (with T eff &lt; 4000 K) would be straightforward with a coronagraph capable of achieving a raw contrast of only 10 −8 , it is important to remember that the probability that such cool stars host a gas giant is small (of order a few percent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Johnson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Montet et al. 2014</ref>). Additionally, the coronagraph inner and outer working angles will constrain the range of planet-star apparent separations (which are related to orbital separations) accessible to the telescope when observing a system at a given distance. These constraints are shown as dashed lines for distances of 5 pc and 15 pc in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. For fixed F TOA and a system distance of 5 pc, the OWA would not allow observations of the gray Jupiter world at quadrature over the entire wavelength range for host stars with effective temperatures above 5800 K. When placed at 15 pc, the IWA can prevent observations at the longest wavelengths for stars with effective temperature below 4900 K.</p><p>The remaining panels in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> show non-gray cases, where realistic reflectivities are used. Like the gray case, the Jupiter twins have F TOA = 50.5 W m −2 , while the cool and warm Jupiters have F TOA = 342 W m −2 and F TOA = 2140 W m −2 , respectively. With the planet-star flux ratio now a function of wavelength, these plots allow us to easily determine roughly what raw contrast must be achieved to detect different types of Jupiters at continuum wavelengths and within absorption features. The Jupiter twins and the cool Jupiters are relatively reflective and have several methane bands covering a range of feature depths. Note that the Jupiter twins have low planet-star contrast ratios due to their small F TOA . Additionally, despite their large F TOA , the warm Jupiters have low planet-star contrast ratios at longer wavelengths due to strong methane and water vapor bands as well as a lack of water clouds.</p><p>Figure 3 is similar to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> but for Neptune twins, cool Neptunes, and warm Neptunes. Neptune twins have very low planet-star flux ratios due to a very small F TOA (1.5 W m −2 ), and would also be difficult to detect for a wide range of stellar effective temperatures due to the telescope OWA restrictions. The flux ratios improve for the cool and warm cases, but are lower than the equivalent Jupiter-sized cases as Neptune is 2.9 times smaller than Jupiter. Also, the methane and water bands for these cases are deeper than those for the Jupiters, yielding flux ratios near 10 −10 -10 −11 over much of parameter space.</p><p>Continuing downwards in the size/mass regime, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows planet-star contrast ratios for Venus twins (F TOA = 2610 W m −2 ), as well as for Earth twins and super-Earths (both with F TOA = 1370 W m −2 ). The Venus twins have comparatively high planet-star flux ratios, both due to their high reflectivity and large F TOA , and have nearly featureless spectra over the highlighted wavelength range. Inner working angle constraints make Venus twins very difficult to detect for our chosen architecture, especially at longer wavelengths. For Earths and super-Earths, the visible wavelength range contains key spectral features-the 0.76 µm O 2 A-band and the 0.94 µm water band-but IWA constraints largely limit our ability to characterize such planets around cool stars.</p><p>The relationships between wavelength-dependent reflectivity, host star effective temperature, and planet-star flux ratio discussed above can be straightforwardly manipulated to show contours of stellar effective temperature where planet types achieve a given flux ratio. Four such plots are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, which illustrate the range of different stellar spectral types that can be investigated for a specified planet type and contrast performance. These diagrams demonstrate how, for a fixed planet-star flux ratio, the depths of absorption bands can best be probed for cooler stars, where the low intrinsic stellar brightness compensates for the low planetary reflectivity. As before, inner and outer working angle limitations are shown for planet-star systems at 5 pc and 15 pc.</p></div>

These exposure times determine whether or not it is realistically feasible to acquire the types of observations needed to characterize planets at a wide range of wavelengths, especially given constraints on mission duration and overall mission time allotted for exoplanet studies. While we highlight SNR = 5 as a minimum value needed for characterization- <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marley et al. (2014)</ref> were able to draw scientifically valuable conclusions from their simulated data at this SNR-the exposure times discussed here can be easily scaled to other SNRs since ∆t exp ∝ SNR 2 .</p><p>Wavelength-dependent integration times required to achieve SNR = 5 fixed F TOA cases are shown for Jupiter twins and cool Jupiters at a characteristic distance of 10 pc in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>Requisite integration times for the cool Jupiters are promising, reaching SNR = 5 in 10-100 hr, even in the depths of some methane absorption bands. For the Jupiter twins, detecting the bottom of these bands requires more than 10 3 hours of observation, owing to these planets' larger orbital distances, although binning data to lower spectral resolution (R =20-30) would drive down the requisite exposure times (by a factor of a few). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> shows integration times required to achieve SNR = 5 for cool Neptunes at a distance of 10 pc. Note that these integration times show a much larger dynamic range than the cool Jupiter cases owing to the generally deeper methane bands in the geometric albedo spectrum of the Neptunes . Overall, integration times shorter than 10 3 hr are only achieved below 0.7 µm, owing to both strong absorption features and falling stellar spectra at longer wavelengths.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows integration times to SNR = 5 for Earth twins and super-Earths, both taken to be at 5 pc distance. To maintain integration times shorter than about 10 3 hr, the Earth and super-Earth observations have been degraded to spectral resolutions of 10 and 20, respectively (which would not allow detection of the 0.76 µm A-band of molecular oxygen). Outside of the 0.94 µm water band, the Earth twins have integration times of order 10 3 hr, although achieving such observations for Sun-like stars and hotter would require a contrast noise floor better than 10 −10 . By comparison, super-Earths avoid the contrast limitation over most of parameter space, and require integration times less than 500 hr for most wavelengths (at R = 20).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Integration Times: Molecular Features</head><p>By highlighting key molecular bands in certain planet type spectra, we can investigate the integration times required to detect these features. We explore both the integration time required to achieve a given SNR at the bottom of a molecular band (Equation 6), and the integration time required to detect a band (or bands) of certain species (Equation 7). Recall that the former is indicative of the integration time required to achieve observations suitable for abundance determinations (where detections of the bottoms of multiple bands are required), while the latter indicates the time required to determine whether or not a species is present. As before, we set the detection SNR to be 5, which can easily be scaled to other SNR values. Also, for all the bands discussed below, our baseline spectral resolution (R = 70) is sufficient to resolve these bands <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Des Marais et al. 2002)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows integration times for detection of species and bottoms of bands for cool Jupiters as a function of distance to the planetary system. We focus on methane, which is the dominant absorber for the cool Jupiters (and Neptunes) at visible wavelengths. For detecting the bottoms of bands, we highlight the 0.73 µm and 0.89 µm methane bands, which are, respectively, moderate and strong bands. For detecting methane, we use the 0.73 µm band, although required integration times for detecting the 0.89 µm band are similar, owing to a trade-off between detector quantum efficiency (lower at these wavelengths) and band strength (higher). We also show that the integration time required to detect methane is decreased by about 50% if both bands are used. Including the 0.62 µm methane band does not further decrease integration times, as the shallowness of this band leads to long required integration times for detection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> is similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>, except for cool Neptunes. For detecting band bottoms, we use the 0.54 µm and 0.62 µm methane bands, as detecting the bottom of longer wavelength bands would require contrast ratios better than 10 −10 . We show integration times for methane detection using the 0.62 µm band, and including both this band and the 0.73 µm decreases requisite times by about 50%.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 11 and 12</ref> show integration times for band bottom and species detections for Earth twins and super-Earths, respectively. Here, we emphasize the 0.76 µm A-band of molecular oxygen and the 0.94 µm water vapor band. The A-band is a key potential biosignature, while the water vapor band is essential for discerning planetary habitability. Note that the time required to detect the bottom of the A-band is much shorter than the time to detect the presence of the band. This is due to the convolution of the high-resolution Earth reflectance spectrum with the spectrometer line-shape function, which serves to decrease the depth of this band at R = 70 and, thus, makes detection of the band difficult. Thus, the integration time required to reach the bottom of the A-band at a SNR of 5 is not much different from the time to reach the same SNR in the surrounding continuum. We note that requisite integration times for Earths or super-Earths placed at the outer edge of the habitable zone are typically 5-10 times longer due to the lower stellar flux incident on these planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Sensitivity to Key Parameters</head><p>Our baseline parameter set assumed that every planet-star system has one exozodi and that the coronagraph could deliver a raw contrast of 10 −9 . However, exozodi levels can vary by orders of magnitude, as can the designed raw contrast (depending on which mission architecture is adopted). Thus, we explore sensitivity to these two parameters by examining their influence on our ability to characterize a planet for key atmospheric constituents. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> shows the integration time required to achieve SNR = 5 in the bottom of the 0.73 µm methane band as well as the integration time required to detect this band SNR band = 5 for our cool Jupiter model. Panels demonstrate sensitivity to exozodi levels and raw contrast performance at a fixed distance of 10 pc. For these studies, the coronagraph IWA prevents observations of this planet type around stars cooler than 5,300 K. As the 0.73 µm methane band is not particularly deep or wide in the cool Jupiter reflectance spectrum, integration times for band detection are longer than for detecting the bottom of the band. Nevertheless, even at poor raw contrast performance and/or larger (N ez 10) levels of exozodi, integration times for either band bottom or species detection are below 100 hr. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 14</ref> is similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>, but for the cool Neptune model. Here we use the 0.62 µm methane band, because, as mentioned earlier, the bottom of the 0.73 µm band is at a contrast ratio of less than 10 −10 . We place the planet-star systems at a distance of 5 pc. Integration times for band detection are now shorter than for detecting the bottom of the band, as the 0.62 µm methane band is deeper in the cool Neptune reflectance spectrum than the 0.73 µm band in the cool Jupiter spectrum.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 15</ref> shows sensitivity tests for the integration times required to detect the 0.76 µm oxygen A-band for 1.5R ⊕ super-Earths. We place the planet-star systems at a distance of 3.7 pc, which is roughly the distance to τ Ceti. We do not consider the 0.94 µm water vapor band as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> shows that detecting this band at 3.7 pc would require nearly a 10 4 hr integration time. Also, we do not consider the integration time required to detect the bottom of the band as this is shorter than the time to detect the band.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Towards Large UV/Optical/Infrared Telescopes</head><p>Large UV-Optical-Infrared telescopes have been proposed as important tools for continuing NASA's vision for exploring and characterizing exoplanets beyond the James Webb Space Telescope mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kouveliotou et al. 2014</ref>). The capabilities of such a 10-meter class space-based telescope, if equipped with a coronagraph, can be investigated using the formalism outlined above. As an example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 16</ref> shows integration times to SNR = 5 across a broad wavelength range, and sensitivity to exozodi levels for the 0.76 µm oxygen A-band for Earth twins, as would be the primary target of a LUVOIR mission. We have adopted an extended wavelength range (0.4-3 µm), and have assumed the distance to these systems is 10 pc. We have extended the OWA to a more generous 20λ/D and use C = 10 −10 , as could hopefully be achieved by such a distant-future mission. Also, we extend the IWA to 3λ/D, as telescope stability for a 10-meter class observatory would make achieving smaller IWAs very challenging. (Note that this larger IWA is outside the 2λ/D "practical limit to small IWA coronagraphy" determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mawet et al. (2014)</ref>.) Finally, we assume that the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges would be handled by two separate detectors, with respective pixel/lenslet sizes determined at 0.4 µm and 1.0 µm. For the near-infrared detector, we adopt a dark current, read noise, and quantum efficiency that are representative of HgCdTe detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Morgan &amp; Siegler 2015</ref> For the adopted LUVOIR architecture and for Earth twins at 10 pc, most of the wavelength-T eff parameter space is dominated by noise from dark current, which is not influenced by telescope diameter. If not for the larger dark current rates of the nearinfrared HgCdTe detector, exozodiacal light would be the dominant noise source at longer wavelengths, owing to its strong wavelength dependence (∝ λ 4 F s,λ ). Note also that the wavelength-dependent IWA at 3λ/D limits our ability to obtain a full spectrum through the near-infrared for all but the hottest stars. For Earth twins at 5 pc, the IWA restrictions are less strict (although the OWA can restrict observations at quadrature for stars hotter than 5,500 K), and leakage from the star can dominate over other noise sources at visible wavelengths for stars hotter than about 6,000 K. This all assumes that the telescope system can be cooled to a sufficiently low temperature to minimize thermal noise contributions to observations in the near-infrared (i.e., below about 80 K). As an example of the capabilities of a LUVOIR mission, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 17</ref> shows a simulated observation of an Earth twin orbiting a solar twin, assuming the system is at 10 pc and an integration time of 200 hr.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Direct characterization of exoplanets in reflected light will require moving beyond Vband detections, and will utilize a wide range of wavelengths. This added spectral dimension influences our understanding of spectrographic observations with coronagraph-equipped telescopes in a variety of ways. First, planet-star flux ratios are a strong function of wavelength, owing to the presence of gaseous and aerosol absorption/extinction features (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sudarsky et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>). Thus, while a coronagraph may provide a raw contrast, or achieve a contrast floor, that can detect certain planet types at continuum wavelengths, this performance may not permit adequate SNRs in molecular absorption bands, thereby impeding characterization attempts.</p><p>Second, as coronagraphs have inner and outer working angles that depend on wavelength, the variety of planets accessible for observation will depend on distance from the Solar System. The interplay between planet-star flux ratio, wavelength, host star effective temperature, and inner and outer working angle constraints are depicted for different planet types in <ref type="figure">Figures 2-4</ref>. These contour diagrams are extremely useful for understanding the types of observations that could be made by a given mission architecture and, to our knowledge, are the first of their kind. Additionally, these diagrams depict an important reality of exoplanet spectral characterization: wavelength-dependent instrument inner and/or outer working angles can cause portions of a exoplanetary spectrum to be unobservable, depending on the apparent planet-star separation at the time of observation.</p><p>Recall that we have defined a planet "type" based, in part, on insolation and size. Thus, <ref type="figure">Figures 2-4</ref> show that a 2λ/D IWA for a 2-meter class telescope will strongly limit our ability to study warm Jupiters and Neptunes (at distances equivalent to 0.8 AU from the Sun) and Venus-like planets. Cool Jupiters and Neptunes (at distances equivalent to 2 AU from the Sun) are much more accessible. Interestingly, the presence of thick water clouds in the atmospheres of the cool Jupiters and Neptunes make these worlds very reflective compared to their warm counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>). Hence, the planet-star flux ratios in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 2 and 3</ref> are broadly similar for these planet types, even though the insolation levels of the warm planet types is over six times larger.</p><p>For our baseline parameters, integration times for cool Jupiters are relatively short, even out to 10 pc ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>). Detecting the bottom of the 0.73 µm methane band, which could indicate different planet formation scenarios as it can distinguish between different amounts of heavy element enhancement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cahoy et al. 2010</ref>), can be accomplished with a 10 hr integration time (or less) for distances as large as 7 pc and with 100 hr integration times out to 13 pc <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 9</ref>). Integration times required to detect the 0.73 µm methane band are similar, and could be decreased by about 50% by observing both the 0.73 µm and 0.89 µm methane bands. Detecting the bottom of the 0.89 µm band in less than 100 hr is limited to cool Jupiters at distances of 6 pc or less, where the overall longer integration times for detecting the bottom of this band are driven up by falling detector quantum efficiencies at these wavelengths. Finally, these integration times are largely insensitive to raw contrast performance and exozodi levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13)</ref>. Regarding the latter, dust clearing by giant planets will likely prevent large exozodi levels in the vicinity of a giant (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Papaloizou et al. 2007</ref>), limiting the range of realistic values for N ez in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>.</p><p>Resolution 70 spectra at constant SNR for Jupiter twins are limited by long integration times in methane bands at long wavelengths, which can exceed 10 3 hr (Figures 6). Such long integration times are unrealistic (especially on a shared resource like WFIRST-AFTA-the Hubble Deep Field used less than 200 hr of exposure time). Only for continuum wavelengths between about 0.5-0.8 µm do integration times for SNR = 5 spectra fall below 10 3 hr for a Jupiter twin at 10 pc. While integration times for Jupiter twins around closer (i.e., less than about 5 pc) stars would be much shorter, telescope OWA constraints would limit study of twins in these nearby systems to cool stars (i.e., roughly 4,300 K or less for the orbit to be entirely within the OWA). Note, however, that the OWA constraint is less strict than the IWA constraint, as some fraction of the orbit, both towards gibbous and crescent phases, can occur inside the OWA, depending on orbit parameters and orientation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Greco &amp; Burrows 2015</ref>).</p><p>For the cool Neptunes, a coronagraph contrast noise floor of 10 −10 would strongly limit observations at longer wavelengths <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figures 7)</ref>, although detecting the 0.62 µm methane band with integration times below 100 hr can be done out to distances of about 5 pc ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>). As this band is relatively deep in the reflectance spectrum of cool Neptunes, integration times for detecting the bottom of the 0.62 µm band are longer, remaining below 100 hr only out to 3-4 pc. The 0.54 µm methane band is shallower, so detecting its bottom can be done with integration times comparable to the band detection times for the 0.62 µm band.</p><p>Inner working angle constraints strongly limit the ability of a 2-meter class telescope to study Earths and super-Earths at 1 AU flux equivalent distances from their host stars. Covering the entire 0.4-1 µm spectral range at a distance of 5 pc (or more) requires solar twins (or hotter). For Earth twins, this implies planet-star flux ratios of 10 −10 -10 −11 , which could be improved by a factor of (R p /R ⊕ ) 2 for super-Earths (assuming similar reflectivity). Additionally, maintaining integration times below even 10 3 hr at continuum wavelengths for these worlds at 5 pc would require degrading spectra to R = 10-20 to achieve SNR = 5 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 8</ref>), notably ruling out detection of the 0.76 µm oxygen A-band <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brandt &amp; Spiegel 2014)</ref>. Such long integration times may be an unrealistic price to pay for characterizing potentially habitable worlds. Additionally, a 2λ/D coronagraph IWA could interfere with our ability to detect the 0.94 µm water vapor band, a key indicator of habitability, for 5 pc Earths and super-Earths around Sun-like stars and cooler. These IWA constraints could be alleviated by investigating worlds at the outer edge of the habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kopparapu et al. 2013</ref>), but the low incident flux on these worlds pushes integration to times 10 3 hr (assuming an Earth-like size and reflectivity), even at R = 10.</p><p>Shorter integration times and more favorable contrast ratios argue for super-Earths as being more attractive targets than Earth-sized worlds. Even for these worlds, though, detecting the oxygen A-band with integration times less than 10 3 hr requires targets to be nearer than about 3 pc ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13)</ref>. Only a few stars meet the distance and effective temperature requirements (α Centauri A and B, Eridani), and most of these stars are in multi-star systems. Detecting the 0.94 µm water vapor band in super-Earth spectra with integration times below 10 3 hr will be extremely challenging, if not impossible, owing in large part to extremely low detector quantum efficiencies at these wavelengths. This outlook could be improved by using detectors with better quantum efficiency at red visible wavelengths, although these detectors tend to have larger dark currents, which might diminish any possible improvements.</p><p>While our results show that characterizing Earth twins with a 2-meter class, coronagraphequipped telescope will be unlikely, 10-meter class LUVOIR telescopes show much more promising results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 16</ref>). Such a mission could achieve R = 70 visible wavelength spectra at SNR = 5 for Earth twins at a characteristic distance of 10 pc for integration times of order 100 hr. Falling stellar spectra and strong water vapor absorption drive up integration times at near-infrared wavelengths. Additionally, falling CCD quantum efficiency will drive up required integration times for species and band bottom detection at red visible wavelengths, especially for the 0.94 µm water vapor band. Using the near-infrared HgCdTe detector at these wavelengths can improve required integration times by an order of magnitude, even when accounting for the larger dark current and read noise in these detectors. Finally, note that telescope IWA constraints can prevent observations of large parts of the near-infrared wavelength range for Earth twins orbiting Sun-like stars at 10 pc, and exozodi levels larger than N ez = 10 begin to rapidly drive up integration times.</p><p>Moving beyond requisite integration times and sensitivities, several of our assumptions about our instrumental, astrophysical, and planetary parameters warrant further discussion. Most notably, current experimental coronagraphs designed to achieve raw contrasts suitable for exoplanet characterization typically operate only over a ∼20% bandpass (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Trauger et al. 2013</ref>), which is limited by chromatic effects within the wavefront control system (although progress is being made on some aspects of this problem, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Newman et al. 2015</ref>). Thus, if only a single coronagraph is used, observing over the full 0.4-1.0 µm range used in this work would require 4-5 separate integrations, thereby driving up overall characterization time. This feature of coronagraphs is not entirely negative, as integration times in different bandpasses could be tailored to prevent achieving unnecessarily large SNRs in bright spectral regions. Also, while we include stellar leakage from the coronagraph, we did not consider how systematic errors from speckle subtraction might impact performance and increase required integration times, all of which would depend on telescope stability, the capabilities of the coronagraph wave-front control system, and how well speckles can be modeled ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Krist et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>Regarding astrophysical assumptions, recall that our noise models assumed that the starplanet systems were isolated in the instrument field-of-view. In reality, stellar companions (which are common, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Duchêne &amp; Kraus 2013)</ref> and background objects will contribute light to the observations, possibly within the planetary PSF. Stray light from a companion could impact the systematic contrast noise floor and/or the raw contrast performance. While simplistic for companion star scenarios, our sensitivity studies to raw contrast performance (C) provide an estimate for how integration times would change if a companion were to increase the contrast background. Also, we assume smoothly varying exozodi structure that only depends on distance from the host star. Real exozodiacal disks will have more complex structure, such as clumps and bands, and studies of such structure would be a major science driver of a space-based coronagraph mission.</p><p>While we have presented a range of planet models and types, the true diversity of exoplanets will be much greater. Additionally, some of our planet types (the warm and cool Jupiters and Neptunes) are based on models that do not include atmospheric photochemistry. For the Solar System gas and ice giants, this chemistry leads to haze formation, which causes lower albedos at blue wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Karkoschka 1994)</ref>. Thus, we are likely underestimating integration times for these worlds at the shortest wavelengths. Also, our placement of planet types at flux equivalent distances attempts, to first order, to maintain self-consistent atmospheric and cloud structures for these worlds. This treatment does not account for the shift of cooler stellar spectral energy distributions to longer wavelengths, where planets tend to be more absorbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marley et al. 1999</ref>). So, our planet types around cooler stars would be absorbing more stellar flux, implying that an "absorbed flux" equivalent distance is further from the host star than our incident bolometric flux equivalent distance.</p></div>

Observational investigations will not have control over planetary properties, but we do have control over instrument performance requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1. Planet Count Rate</head><p>The planetary signal is the incident stellar host spectrum, weighted by a wavelength-and phase-dependent planetary reflectance, and passed through the optics of a distant telescope. We assume that the host star has radius R s and a spectrum of a blackbody, B λ (T eff ), where T eff is the stellar effective temperature. Thus, the specific flux density at a distance d from the stellar host is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">F s,λ (d) = πB λ (T eff ) R s d 2 .<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>Note that non-blackbody stellar spectra, either from observations or models, can be used for F s,λ (d)-we simply adopt blackbody spectra for efficiency, allowing us to rapidly model large swaths of parameter space. If the planetary target has radius R p , orbits its host at a distance r, is observed at phase angle (i.e., star-planet-observer angle) α, and has a wavelength-dependent geometric albedo A, then the specific flux density at a distance d from the planet is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">F p,λ (d) = AΦ(α)F s,λ (r) R p d 2 = πAΦ(α)B λ (T eff ) R s r 2 R p d 2 ,<label>(A2)</label></formula><p>where Φ(α) is the planetary phase function, which is generally a function of wavelength. Thus, the wavelength-dependent planet-star flux ratio is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F p,λ F s,λ = AΦ(α) R p r 2 ,<label>(A3)</label></formula><p>which, of course, is only a function of the product of the geometric albedo and phase function (i.e., the phase-dependent planetary reflectivity), and the ratio of the planetary radius to the orbital separation.</p><p>At the telescope, a distance d from the star-planet system, the planetary flux is passed through the optical components, with total throughput T (which can, in general, be wavelengthdependent) and spectral bandwidth ∆λ, and converted into counts on the detector with quantum efficiency q (in dimensionless units of counts per photon).

Here, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and f pa is a factor of order unity (computed using X, the photometric aperture length) that describes the fraction of light from the planet that falls within the photometric aperture.

Zodiacal and Exozodiacal Light</head><p>Local zodiacal light is known to be a function of ecliptic latitude and longitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Levasseur- Regourd &amp; Dumont 1980)</ref>, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stark et al. (2014)</ref> demonstrated that a constant Vband surface brightness of M z,V = 23 mag arcsec −2 was a reasonably accurate representation. Thus, we take the wavelength-dependent zodiacal light count rate to be given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">c z = πqT Ω∆λ λ hc D 2 2 F ,λ (1 AU) F ,V (1 AU) F 0,V 10 −M z,V /2.5 , (A7)</formula><p>where F ,λ is the wavelength-dependent specific solar flux density, F ,V is the solar flux density in V-band, Ω is the photometry aperture area (with dimensions of arcsec 2 ), and F 0,V is the standard zero-magnitude V-band specific flux density (F 0,V = 3.6×10 −8 W m −2 µm −1 ).</p><p>We use a square aperture with width Xλ/D along an edge, such that Ω = (Xλ/D) 2 , to most accurately represent a square grid of pixels (or spaxels) that would be used to isolate the planet. Note that the ratio F ,λ /F ,V in Equation A7 forces the color of the zodiacal light spectrum to match that of the Sun, which is a reasonable approximation, especially at large elongation angles from the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Leinert et al. 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Inserting Ω, and assuming constant spectral resolution, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">c z = πqT X 2 λ 4 4hcR F ,λ (1 AU) F ,V (1 AU) F 0,V 10 −M z,V /2.5 , (A8)</formula><p>which is a strong function of wavelength.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stark et al. (2014)</ref>, we define a "zodi" as the surface brightness of an exozodiacal disk at 1 AU from a solar twin, which we label M ez,V . Then the wavelength-dependent exozodiacal light count rate is given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">c ez = πqT Ω∆λ λ hc D 2 2 1 AU r 2 F s,λ (1 AU) F s,V (1 AU) F s,V (1 AU) F ,V (1 AU) N ez F 0,V 10 −M ez,V /2.5 , (A9)</formula><p>where N ez is the number of exozodis in the disk. Note that the F s,V /F ,V term ensures that exozodiacal light surface brightness scales with the intrinsic stellar brightness (at fixed orbital distance), and the (1 AU/r) 2 term causes the disk surface brightness to decrease with increasing orbital separation according to the 1/r 2 law. Again, inserting Ω, and assuming constant spectral resolution, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">c ez = πqT X 2 λ 4 4hcR F s,V (1 AU) F ,V (1 AU) N ez F 0,V 10 −M ez,V /2.5 . (A10)</formula><p>For a discussion of the variety of different exozodiacal light treatments and exozodi definitions adopted throughout the literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Roberge et al. (2012)</ref>. Note that, while the zodiacal and exozodiacal light count rates are independent of telescope diameter, the ratio of the planetary signal to the zodiacal and exozodiacal light signals will depend on telescope size</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">[c p / (c z + c ez ) ∝ D 2 ].</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Leakage, Dark Counts, and Read Noise</head><p>We consider several other key sources of noise. Stellar light leaked through the coronagraph ("leakage") can contribute a large number of noise counts as the host star is many orders of magnitude brighter than the target planet. The leakage count rate is determined from the stellar photon flux passed through the observing system, diminished by C (the coronagraph design raw contrast), and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">c lk = πqT C∆λF s,λ (d) λ hc D 2 2 = qT CB λ (T eff ) λ 2 hcR πDR s 2d 2 , (A11)</formula><p>where the final step assumes constant spectral resolution. Detections are possible for sources fainter than the raw contrast, but coronagraphs will have systematic noise floors that limit how far below the raw contrast observations can go. The noise floor limit is due to residuals in the subtracted stellar PSF, and is typically a factor of ten below the raw contrast. This limit is important to keep in mind when discussing small, low-albedo, and/or large separation planetary companions.</p><p>For a given dark current D e − , in counts per pixel per unit time, the dark count rate is</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">c D = D e − N pix , (A12)</formula><p>where N pix is the number of detector pixels contributing to the spectral element. For imaging, the contributing pixels are those that fall within the aperture (Ω), so that, if a pixel has an angular diameter θ pix , then</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">N pix,i = 4Ω πθ 2 pix , (A13)</formula><p>where the sub-script 'i' has been introduced for 'imaging'. If the pixel diameter is determined by the diffraction limit at some wavelength λ 0 , giving θ pix λ 0 /2D, then the number of contributing pixels is simply</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">N pix,i = 16 π Xλ λ 0 2 . (A14)</formula><p>Determining the number of contributing pixels for a spectrometer is more complicated. For an integral field spectrometer (IFS), angularly-resolved spectroscopic observations are obtained by placing a grid of small lenses (called "lenslets") in the focal plane, spectrally dispersing the light from each lenslet, and recording the resulting spectra at the detector. For this setup, the number of contributing pixels is</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">N pix,s = n pix ∆λ 4Ω πθ 2 lens , (A15)</formula><p>where 's' is for 'spectroscopy', n pix is the number of pixels per unit wavelength designed for each lenslet spectrum, and θ lens is the angular diameter of an individual lenslet (so that 4Ω/πθ 2 lens is the number of lenslets over which the aperture is distributed). For a spectrum sampled at two pixels per spectral resolution element, and spread over ∆N hpix pixels in the horizontal/spatial dimension, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">n pix = ∆N hpix 2R λ = 2∆N hpix ∆λ , (A16)</formula><p>which gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">N pix,s = 8∆N hpix Ω πθ 2 lens . (A17)</formula><p>Again, if the lenslets are sized to yield the diffraction limit at some reference wavelength, then we would have</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">N pix,s = ∆N hpix 32 π Xλ λ 0 2 . (A18)</formula><p>Note that the lenslet array typically only covers the inner portion of the overall imaging area, with coverage limited by detector space for recording individual lenslet spectra. Thus, lenslet arrays and, more importantly, their associated detectors can set a tighter constraint on the OWA than the coronagraph.</p><p>Read noise is computed using the number of reads per observation, N read , the number of contributing pixels, and the read noise counts per pixel, R e − , and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">c R = N pix N read ∆t exp R e − ,<label>(A19)</label></formula><p>where dividing by the exposure time, ∆t exp , permits expressing read noise counts as a rate.</p><p>The number of reads is determined by assuming a maximum exposure time, ∆t max (often limited by cosmic ray strikes), with</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">N read = ∆t exp ∆t max (A20)</formula><p>so that Equation A19 can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">c R = N pix ∆t max R e − .<label>(A21)</label></formula><p>Note that integer quantities (e.g., numbers of pixels) can be determined by rounding the expressions above, which are, for simplicity, expressed as non-integer quantities.</p><p>For completeness, internal thermal noise can be included and has a count rate given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">c th = πqΩ λ hc sys B λ (T sys ) ∆λ D 2 2 = πqq sys B λ (T sys ) X 2 λ 4 4hcR , (A22)</formula><p>where sys is the effective emissivity for the observing system (of order unity), and T sys is the system temperature. As we focus primarily on the visible wavelength range throughout this paper, internal thermal contributions are negligible, so we ignore them throughout.    Scalings for gaseous absorption are constant with wavelength for each species and arbitrary; these were chosen to highlight relevant bands. The haze opacity is for extinction by a Titan tholin-lke haze, and the Rayleigh scattering opacities are scaled to that of CO 2 at 0.4 µm (and divided by 10).       For band detections, we use the 0.73 µm methane band, as its depth leads to shorter required integration times than bands at shorter wavelengths. The lower right plot shows how the band detection time decreases when both the 0.62 µm and 0.73 µm methane features are used. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>.-The same as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, except for 1.5R ⊕ super-Earths. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 13</ref>.-Contours of integration time required to achieve SNR = 5 in the bottom of the 0.73 µm methane band (top) or to detect this band at SNR band = 5 (bottom) for a cool Jupiter at a distance of 10 pc for various levels of exozodis and raw contrast.
