			<abstract>
				<p>We present new UVES spectra of a sample of 15 cool unevolved stars with and without detected planetary companions. Together with previous determinations, we study Be depletion and possible differences in Be abundances between both groups of stars. We obtain a final sample of 89 and 40 stars with and without planets, respectively, which covers a wide range of effective temperatures, from 4700 K to 6400 K, and includes several cool dwarf stars for the first time. We determine Be abundances for these stars and find that for most of them (the coolest ones) the BeII resonance lines are often undetectable, implying significant Be depletion. While for hot stars Be abundances are aproximately constant, with a slight fall as T eff decreases and the Li-Be gap around 6300 K, we find a steep drop of Be content as T eff decreases for T eff &lt; 5500 K, confirming the results of previous papers. Therefore, for these stars there is an unknown mechanism destroying Be that is not reflected in current models of Be depletion. Moreover, this strong Be depletion in cool objects takes place for all the stars regardless of the presence of planets, thus, the effect of extra Li depletion in solar-type stars with planets when compared with stars without detected planets does not seem to be present for Be, although the number of stars at those temperatures is still small to reach a final conclusion.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Light elements are important tracers of stellar internal mixing and rotation. Since they are burned at relatively low temperatures they constrain how the material inside stars is mixed with the hotter interior. Rotation and angular momentum loss are among the leading processes to explain the mixing that leads to depletion of light elements in solar-type stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Stephens et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouvier 2008</ref>) although gravitational waves may also affect the abundances of those elements <ref type="bibr">(Montalbán &amp; Schatzman 2000)</ref>. However, available models for evolution of Be (considering rotation) do not predict a significant depletion of Be during the main sequence for stars with 6000 K &gt; T eff &gt; 4000 K <ref type="bibr">(Pinsonneault et al. 1990</ref>). On the other hand, models which take into account gravitational waves predict significant Be depletion only for stars cooler than 4500 K <ref type="bibr">(Montalbán &amp; Schatzman 2000)</ref>.</p><p>In a recent work, <ref type="bibr">Israelian et al. (2009)</ref> confirmed that Li was severely depleted in solar-type stars (with T eff between 5600 K and 5850 K) with planets when compared with similar stars without detected planets although this result is controversial ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baumann et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sousa et al. 2010)</ref>; for a complete discussion see Delgado <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mena et al. (2011)</ref>. This difference in Li abundance seems to be related to the different rotational history of both groups of stars due to the presence of protoplanetary disks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bouvier 2008</ref>). However, beryllium needs a greater temperature to be burned so we would expect to see the onset of this effect in cooler stars where convective envelopes are deep enough to reach those higher temperatures.</p><p>In a previous paper, Delgado <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mena et al. (2011)</ref> found two cool planet host stars with an extra depletion of Be when compared with analog stars without detected planets. This encourages us to try to investigate this process in cool stars. In this work we continue that analysis by extending the sample with 15 new cool stars. We refer the reader to that paper for further information and a more extensive introduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations and spectral synthesis</head><p>In this study we obtained high resolution spectra for 15 new stars with magnitudes V between 6 and 10 using the UVES spectrograph at the 8.2-m Kueyen VLT (UT2) telescope (run ID 86.D-0082A) between October 2010 and March 2011. The dichroic mirror was used to obtain also red spectra and the slit width was 0.5 arcsec. These new spectra have a spectral resolution R ∼ 70000 and S/N ratios between 100 and 200. All the data were reduced with the pipeline of UVES/VLT. Standard background correction, flat-field and extraction procedures were used. The wavelength calibration was made using a ThAr lamp spectrum taken during the same night. Finally we manually normalized the continuum by dividing the spectra by a spline function with three pieces (and the parameter low − reject set to 1) in the whole blue region <ref type="bibr">(3040Å3040Å-3800Å3800Å)</ref>. This normalization does not present any bias for stars with and without planets. When plotting together observed spectra of stars with and without planets we only had to multiply the flux of comparison stars by 0.9-1.1 in order to make them match up. We note that in our previous works we have analyzed high metallicity (up to 0.4) solar type stars with Teff down to 5300 K for which we could make a good normalization. The main problem is the normalization of spectra of stars with Teff less than ∼ 5300 K. These stars could have spots and inhomogeneous atmospheres that make the spectral synthesis more difficult.</p><p>The uniform stellar atmospheric parameters were taken from <ref type="bibr">Sousa et al. (2008)</ref> with typical errors of 25 K for T eff , 0.04 dex for log g, 0.03 km s −1 for ξ t and 0.02 dex for metallicity. We refer to that work for further details in these parameters and their uncertainties.</p><p>Be abundances were derived by fitting the spectral region around the Be II line at 3131.06Å06Å and then using the Be II line 3130.42Å42Å to check the consistency of the fit. We used an empirical line list from García <ref type="bibr">López et al. (1995)</ref> tuned to reproduce the solar spectrum (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). These synthetic spectra were convolved with a rotational profile. We made a standard LTE analysis with the revised version of the spectral synthesis code MOOG2002 <ref type="bibr">(Sneden 1973</ref>) and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres with overshooting ( <ref type="bibr">Kurucz et al. 1993</ref>). Examples of synthetic spectra and the parameters used in the synthesis are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The final sample is composed of 70 and 30 stars with and without planets, respectively, from <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. (2002</ref><ref type="bibr">Santos et al. ( , 2004a</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. (2011)</ref>, 14 stars with planets from Delgado Mena et al. (2011) and 5 and 10 stars with and without detected planets, respectively, from this work. This gives a total sample of 89 stars with planets and 40 comparison sample stars. All Be abundances for these 89+40 stars were analyzed by our team using the same methodology, making this a very uniform sample.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analysis</head><p>In general, Be abundances for stars cooler than 5200 K are probably not reliable since in this regime Be lines are barely sensitive to changes in the abundance. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we can observe that for the coolest stars the fits are not good. At those temperatures Mn I line at 3129.037Å037Å dominates the feature and the presence of Be is negligible (see also García <ref type="bibr">López et al. 1995</ref>). We make several tests to try to improve those fits.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> we show several spectral syntheses. In panel a we have used different line lists for HD 213042. The orange dashed line is a fit made with original Kurucz line list 2 . It is clear that the Mn-Be feature cannot be well reproduce with the original value of log gf for Mn line even if we increase Be abundance (light blue dashedpointed line). Furthermore, the lambda of the whole feature do not match Be line, so this star do not present so much Be and another line is required to fit the observed spectrum. <ref type="bibr">Primas et al. (1997)</ref> used an artificial Fe line at 3131.043 which in our case does not help to fit the spectrum (purple dashed-three pointed line) since this line gets stronger in metallic stars. Another option is to increase the gf of Mn line at 3131.037Å037Å. This was first proposed by García <ref type="bibr">López et al. (1995)</ref> to reproduce solar spectrum and we also used this modified line in our previous works on Be. The green line represents a fit with Kurucz line list and this modified line. We note that for our syntheses we have used Mn measured abundances by <ref type="bibr">Neves et al. (2009)</ref> with the same models. This fit is better but the feature is still stronger than observed in its red wing although the Be abundance used in the syntehsis is negligible. The synthetic spectra of these cool stars present strong molecular lines. If we decrease O and C abundances (red line) we can get a better fit though this does not affect Be line at 3131.06Å06Å.</p><p>The different contributions of molecular an atomic lines is shown in panel b for star HD 16270. The Mn-Be feature is practically filled with atomic lines, that is, Mn line. Therefore we can put an upper limit in Be abundance since increasing Be abundance would result in a stronger line with a 2 http://kurucz.harvard.edu/line lists.html core shifted towards higher λ which would not fit the observed spectrum. We can again get a better fit if we decrease O and C abundances (red line). However, as the stars get cooler we need to use lower C and O abundances, ∼ -0.6 dex for O and ∼ -0.9 dex for C in this star. This is not a realistic approach but fortunately C and O abundances hardly affect the Be feature.</p><p>In panel c we show three syntheses for HD 63454 with the solar line list derived by García <ref type="bibr">López et al. (1995)</ref> and decreasing C and O abundances -0.3 and -0.2 dex respectively. The fits with log Be = 0.6 and 0.3 dex presents a stronger line than observed, so we can adopt an upper limit of 0.0 dex for this star. Certainly, Be line is not very sensitive at these low temperatures and we think that we may be overestimating Be depletion. However, it is imposible to fit the spectra using high Be abundances so we can put an upper limit in Be content though we cannot calculate accurate abundances. Moreover, the sensitivity of Be line does not seem to be related to T eff since some cool young objets present strong Be lines with abundances similar to solar ( <ref type="bibr">Smiljanic et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Randich et al. 2007)</ref>. This is the case of the star R1 in the young cluster IC 2602 of 46 Myr and solar metallicity. This star was observed by <ref type="bibr">Smiljanic et al. (2011)</ref> who found log Be = 1.25. We have analyzed this star using the same spectrum and three different line lists (see panel d of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>): <ref type="bibr">Primas et al. (1997)</ref> line list, used by these authors, gives log Be = 1.22; our solar line list gives log Be = 1.37 and Kurucz line list with Mn line modified and decreasing C and O abundances by 0.3 dex gives log Be = 1.32, all of them in perfect agreement with the value previously found. Therefore, this test probably suggests that our line list does work for cool stars which present a measurable quantity of Be, and our fittings should be valid at least to put an upper limit in Be abundances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this section we will discuss the different trends of Be abundances with the effective temperature, the metallicity and the oxygen abundance.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Is Be depleted in stars with planets?</head><p>We have seen in the previous section that absolute Be abundances determined with spectral synthesis are probably not reliable for cool stars, preventing a comparison between stars with and without detected planets. In order to search for differences in Be abundances between those stars we proposed to compare directly their spectra in a previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Delgado Mena et al. 2011</ref>). We selected pairs of stars with similar stellar parameters so if there were a difference between their spectra in the Be region it should be due to a difference in Be abundance. In that paper we presented two planet-host stars, HD 330075 and HD 13445, with an extra Be depletion when com- pared to analogous stars without detected planets, showing that the effect observed in Li abundances for solar-type stars with giant planets might also occur for Be in cooler stars.</p><p>In this work we present new spectra for 15 cool stars (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>) with and without detected planets. Using these stars and others from previous works ( <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. 2004a,c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Delgado Mena et al. 2011</ref>) we made 13 new pairs of analogous stars with differences in T eff , log g and [Fe/H] lower than 50K, 0.15 dex and 0.10 dex respectively. We also note that v sini values of these stars are very similar. Some examples of these couples are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. We can see in these plots that stars with and without planets present similar Be features and the differences in flux between spectra are very low around Be features. In the previous paper we found three stars from the comparison sample with clearly higher Be abundance than the planet-host star HD 330075, whose abundance is log ǫ(Be) &lt; -0.25. Now we have two more stars with very similar parameters. HD 44573 has a higher Be abundance (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table  2</ref>) and the difference in fluxes between both stars is around 5σ in the position of the two Be lines. However, HD 8326 has a spectrum very similar to HD 330075 and Be abundances are almost equal. Therefore, planet host stars and comparison stars can have similar Be abundances. We note, however, that our sample of cool stars is small and although unlikely, it might be possible that we are only observing the fraction of comparison stars with a strong Be depletion. A similar situation is seen for solar-type stars without detected planets, where 50% have high Li abundances while the other 50% do have its Li depleted like planet-hosts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Be versus T eff</head><p>In left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> we plot the derived Be abundances as a function of effective temperature for planet-host stars in our sample (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>) together with previous samples. In this plot we have removed subgiants and giants (except the three analyzed in this work) to avoid evolutionary effects in the abundances. In this selection we took the spectral types of the stars from <ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. (2011)</ref>. With this new sample of stars we have completed the coolest part of the plot and now we can see the behaviour of Be abundances in a wide range of effective temperatures.</p><p>As mentioned in previous papers, the Be abundances decrease from a maximum near T eff = 6100 K towards higher and lower temperatures, in a similar way as Li abundances behave. In the high temperature domain, the steep decrease with increasing temperatures resembles the well known Be gap for F stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boesgaard &amp; King 2002)</ref>. The decrease of the Be content towards lower temperatures is smoother and may show evidence for continuous Be burning during the main sequence evolution of these stars.</p><p>When we move to the coolest stars, we observe a strong Be depletion regardless of the presence of planets. Hence, the planetary formation processes that affect Li depletion in solar analog stars ( <ref type="bibr">Israelian et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gonzalez et al. 2010</ref>) do not seem to take effect in the Be abundances.</p><p>On the other hand, we have found several stars with undetectable or very weak Be lines. The steep decrease of Be abundances for T eff &lt; 5500 K is in contradiction with models of Be depletion <ref type="bibr">(Pinsonneault et al. 1990</ref>), which predict either constant or increasing Be abundances as T eff decreases (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>. Even taking into account mixing by internal waves <ref type="bibr">(Montalbán &amp; Schatzman 2000)</ref>, Be depletion is still lower than predicted. Be abundances have also been studied in clusters of different ages. <ref type="bibr">Randich et al. (2007)</ref> found that stars in the 150 Myr old cluster NGC 2516 with 5000 &lt; T eff &lt; 5500 K have not depleted Be while Hyades stars (600 Myr) of the same T eff present some Be depletion, something that cannot be explained by models with only convective mixing. García <ref type="bibr">López et al. (1995)</ref> also found evidence of Be depletion for two cool Hyades members. Although uncertainties in Be abundandes for the coolest stars are large and it might be some kind of systematic effect due to the Mn I λ 3131.037Å037Å line, many of them seem to have their Be totally destroyed. Therefore, none of those models including convective mixing, rotation or gravitational waves seems to fit the observed Be abundances, at least at these cool temperatures. Other depletion mechanisms have been pro-posed to explain Li destruction, such as tachocline diffusion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brun et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piau et al. 2003</ref>) or episodic accretion of planetary material during the PMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baraffe &amp; Chabrier 2010</ref>) though Be has not been analyzed. However, accretion of planetary material in the ZAMS ( <ref type="bibr">Théado et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Théado &amp; Vauclair 2011</ref>) can lead to an enhanced depletion of Li and Be, as well. These models can explain the difference in the Li abundances between stars with and without planets and might also explain the observed Be differences in a pair of cool planet-hosts when compared to several stars without detected planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Delgado Mena et al. 2011</ref>). On the other hand the depletion produced by episodic accretion does not seem to be enough to explain the strong Be depletion observed in cool stars and the presence of planetary material would be necessary in all stars though many of them do not have detected planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Be versus Li</head><p>A beryllium versus lithium diagram can give us information about the depletion rates in mainsequence stars. In right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> this relation is shown for all the stars in our sample. In general Be abundances increase with increasing Li abundances and stars with and without planets (filled and open symbols, respectively) behave in a similar way. If we take into account the effective temperatures we can divide the sample in four groups. The first one, with the hottest stars (light blue points), present both high Be and Li abundances except for two stars with T eff around 6300K which fall in the Be-Li dip region, where the depletion of those elements is atributted to slow mixing and depends on age and temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boesgaard &amp; King 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boesgaard et al. 2004a</ref>), though one of them, HD 120136 presents a normal Li abundance (log ǫ(Li) = 2.04). In the second group (orange points), with effective temperatures between 5600 and 5900 K, Be abundances remain high although Li abundances present different depletion rates. There are several objects with low Be abundances and solar temperatures (specially the comparison star HD 20766 T eff = 5733 K, log ǫ(Be) &lt; -0.09), which could form some kind of "Be-gap" where the depletion of Be may be related to different pre-main sequence rotational histories ( <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. 2004c</ref>). In a recent work, <ref type="bibr">Takeda et al. (2011)</ref> found four stars with solar temperatures and Be line undetectable. Those stars are also depleted in Li and have low v sini values indicating that slow rotation can be the cause for that strong Be depletion.</p><p>In the third group (blue points), composed by stars with 5150K &lt; T eff &lt; 5600K, Be abundances begin to decrease and Li is severely depleted except for two objects, HD 11964A and HD 21019, with particularly high Li abundances considering its temperature. These two objects are evolved stars, therefore a possible explanation for the high Li content is that they have just left the main sequence, where they were hotter than they are now, but there has not been time for their Li and Be to become strongly depleted. Other possible explanations are a dredge up effect from a "buffer" below the former main sequence convective envelope <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Deliyannis et al. 1990</ref>) or accretion of planetary metal-rich material, although recent models indicate that accretion of planetary material might destroy Li instead of producing an enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baraffe &amp; Chabrier 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Théado et al. 2010</ref>). Finally, the coolest objects of our sample (red symbols) are depleted in both Be and Li, although some stars have preserved some Be. There are two objects with anomalous high Li content. HD 74576 seems to be a young star, something that probably justifies its high Li content (see discussion in <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. 2004c</ref>) while HD 40105 is an evolved star that might have suffered some of the processes proposed for HD 11964A and HD 21019. We note that we have removed from the plots all the evolved stars from previous works. Only the three subgiants observed for this work are analyzed here but there are similar cases in the whole sample (see <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. 2004c;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>This figure confirms what found in <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. (2004a,c)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. (2011)</ref>, Be and Li burning seems to follow the same trend. Both elements increase their content as the temperature rises, although Li depletion begins at 5900 K while strong Be depletion starts below 5500 K. Stars with and without planets behave in a similar way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Be versus [Fe/H]</head><p>In the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> we show Be abundances as a function of metallicity for different temperature ranges. We can see that the stars are equally distributed regardless of their temperature and for higher metallicities the dispersion in Be abundances increases, mainly due to objects with 5150 K &lt; T eff &lt; 5600 K. It is well known that Be abundances increase with metallicity for [Fe/H] &lt; -1 with a steep slope near 1 (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Rebolo et al. 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boesgaard et al. 2009</ref>), but for higher metallicities this relation is not so well defined. In the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> all the dwarf stars of our sample with 5600 K &lt; T eff &lt; 6150 K are plotted. We have chosen this limit in temperature in order to remove most of the upper limits in Be abundances and those stars from the Li-Be dip. We have also removed stars from the solar Be-gap. We find a slope of 0.13 for planet-host stars and 0.07 for comparison sample stars. These values are lower than previously found by other authors but this could be possibly due to the lack of stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.2 in our sample in comparison with the high number of metal-rich objects. It seems that stars with solar and supersolar metallicities do not follow the same trend as metal-poor stars, and Be has been produced at a lower rate as the Galaxy has evolved. However, we note that Be abundances present higher uncertainties in metalrich stars that might be affecting these trends. If we have a look in the upper envelope, which might be more consistent with low er metallicity stars (around [Fe/H] = -0.5), we obtain a fit with a slope of 0.38, more consistent with previous results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Be versus [O/H]</head><p>Beryllium is produced by spallation reactions between galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and the CNO nuclei in the interstellar medium (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Tan et al. 2009</ref>, and references therein). Therefore, oxygen abundances can provide us with complementary information about the galactic evolution of Be. We compile oxygen abundances from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ecuvillon et al. (2006)</ref> (see the final lists in <ref type="bibr">Gálvez-Ortiz et al. 2011</ref>), derived with the OH bands in the near-UV since this region is closed to Be lines. We use the same temperature ranges than in previous section, 5600 K &lt; T eff &lt; 6150 K. Thus, none of the stars analyzed in this work are included in this plot because all of them are cooler than 5600 K. However, 6 planet-host stars from our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Delgado Mena et al. 2011</ref>) are hotter and we have displayed them as green circles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>. Oxygen abundances for these stars have been obtained in the same way as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ecuvillon et al. (2006)</ref> and are presented in Table 3.</p><p>In the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, Be abundances are plotted as a function of <ref type="bibr">[O/H]</ref>. We can see that the slopes of planet hosts and stars without detected planets are slightly different, possibly due to the low number of comparison sample stars in this range. We have removed the star HD154857 since its O abundance is the lowest of this sample and its content in Be is considerable lower than other stars of similar oxygen abundance, hence it would increase the slope by 0.3. We make again a fit of the upper envelope for stars with planets to take into account the lack of stars with low [O/H] in our plot. These trends might be influenced by the effect of T eff in Be abundances. To remove this effect, we have made a new Be vs.</p><p>[O/H] plot (lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>) with "corrected" Be abundances, calculated as log ǫ(Be)-log ǫ(Be(T eff )), where log ǫ(Be(T eff )) is obtained from a linear fit of Be as a function o f temperature in the same T eff range (upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure  6</ref>). However, the slope is still the same for stars with planets. it seems that there remains a correlation between Be and O abundances, which may indicate that the sensitivity of Be to the Teff is not affecting at all this correlation. On the other hand, the comparison sample is so small at this temperature range, that no strong conclusion can be extracted from the different slopes obtained before and after the Be-Teff linear correction.</p><p>Nevertheless, these slopes are considerable lower than previously found for metal-poor stars, <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> Oxygen abundances for stars with T eff &gt; 5400 K from Delgado <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mena et al. (2011)</ref>. . Therefore, the slope for metal-rich stars is much flatter than for metalpoor stars as it seems to happen for Be versus <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. A slope like this would not be in agreement with models of Be production that predict quadratic or linear relations (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Tan et al. 2009</ref>, and references therein). We note again that oxygen abundances present a high dispersion in metal-rich stars and even at low metallicities, the use of different O indicators change this trend.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Star [O/H] 1 [O/H] 2 [O/H] 3 [O/H] 4 [O/H] f inal log ǫ(Be)<label>HD2039 0</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We present new high-resolution UVES/VLT near-UV spectra of 15 stars with and without planets in order to find possible differences in Be abundances between them and confirm our previous results that suggested a greater depletion of Be in planet-host stars when compared with stars without detected planets. Be needs higher temperatures than Li to be destroyed so we have to search for these differences in cooler stars, which have deeper convective envelopes and are able to carry the material towards Be-burning layers. We have made new couples of analog stars with and without planets with the purpose of comparing directly their spectra to see possible differences in Be abundances. Although in a previous work we found a pair of planet-host stars with their Be severely depleted, now we have not observed important differences in Be abundances between both groups of stars. Thus, the effect caused by protoplanetary disks and rotational history on extra Li depletion in solar-type stars with planets is not taking effect in Be abundances, apparently.</p><p>Furthermore, Be abundances in cool stars (T eff &lt; 5200 K) are much lower than predicted by the models. We have analyzed for the first time a considerable number of cool objects and found a strong destruction of Be in most of the stars. Although we cannot provide absolute abundances we can give upper values for Be. This gives a steep drop of Be abundances as T eff diminishes in contradiction with current models of Be depletion.</p><p>Finally, the slopes of Be abundances as a function of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[O/H]</ref> are considerably lower than found for metal-poor stars, indicating that the production rate of Be may have diminished with the evolution of the Galaxy.
