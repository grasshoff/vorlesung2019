				<p>Context. For direct imaging of exoplanets, a stellar coronagraph helps to remove the image of an observed bright star by attenuating the diffraction effects caused by the telescope aperture of diameter D. The Dual Zone Phase Mask (DZPM) coronagraph constitutes a promising concept since it theoretically offers a small inner working angle (IWA ∼ λ 0 /D where λ 0 denotes the central wavelength of the spectral range ∆λ), good achromaticity and high starlight rejection, typically reaching a 10 6 contrast at 5 λ 0 /D from the star over a spectral bandwidth ∆λ/λ 0 of 25% (similar to H-band). This last value proves to be encouraging for broadband imaging of young and warm Jupiter-like planets. Aims. Contrast levels higher than 10 6 are however required for the observation of older and/or less massive companions over a finite spectral bandwidth. An achromatization improvement of the DZPM coronagraph is therefore mandatory to reach such performance. Methods. In its design, the DZPM coronagraph uses a grey (or achromatic) apodization. We propose to replace it by a colored apodization to increase the performance of this coronagraphic system over a large spectral range. This innovative concept, called Colored Apodizer Phase Mask (CAPM) coronagraph, is defined with some design parameters optimized to reach the best contrast in the exoplanet search area. Once this done, we study the performance of the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of different errors to evaluate the sensitivity of our concept. Results. A 2.5 mag contrast gain is estimated from the performance provided by the CAPM coronagraph with respect to that of the DZPM coronagraph. A 2.2 · 10 −8 intensity level at 5 λ 0 /D separation is then theoretically achieved with the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of a clear circular aperture and a 25% bandwidth. In addition, our studies show that our concept is less sensitive to low than high-order aberrations for a given value of rms wavefront errors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Astronomical context</head><p>Recently, the direct imaging of several exoplanets have been made possible ( <ref type="bibr">Kalas et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Marois et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lagrange et al. 2010</ref>) owing to their youth (tens of Myr), their high mass (a few Jupiter masses) or their wide apparent distance from their host star (larger than 1 arcsecond). For imaging older, less massive or less separated planetary companions while enabling their spectroscopic observations, achromatic high contrast imaging techniques are required. However, large broadband imaging of these exoplanets is extraordinarily challenging in the visible and near-infrared bands because of the large flux ratio (10 7 to 10 10 ) and the small angular separation (less than 1 arcsecond) between them and their host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Traub &amp; Oppenheimer 2010)</ref>. Such detection requires the combination of different methods, such as extreme adaptive optics (XAO), stellar coronagraphy and post processing techniques, to enhance the exoplanet image <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Oppenheimer &amp; Hinkley 2009)</ref>. XAO systems on groundbased telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Macintosh et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sauvage et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guyon et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hinkley et al. 2011</ref>) will compensate the effects of the atmospheric turbulence to provide high angular resolution images at very high Strehl ratio. A stellar coronagraph ) will help to mostly suppress the diffraction effects due to the telescope aperture. In addition, postprocessing techniques (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marois et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sparks &amp; Ford 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marois et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lafrenì ere et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mugnier et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vigan et al. 2008</ref>) will allow us to remove the speckles caused by the XAO residual aberrations and the slow variations of the physical conditions of a telescope. The current limits of all these methods need to be pushed further to expect imaging the exoplanets mentioned above. In particular, increasing the performance of the current coronagraphs is mandatory for reaching an excellent polychromatic removal of the star diffraction pattern and image the faintest substellar mass companions in white light. The resulting, innovative coronagraphs will find their place in the exoplanet imagers planned to follow the upcoming Palomar P1640 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hinkley et al. 2011</ref>), VLT-SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>), Gemini Planet Imager ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>) and Subaru HiCIAO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hodapp et al. 2008</ref>): e.g. EPICS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kasper et al. 2008)</ref> for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) on the ground or possible 1-2 m off-axis telescopes in space ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Galicher et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trauger et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guyon et al. 2010c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Broadband capabilities of coronagraphs</head><p>Many coronagraphic designs have been proposed these past few years; most of them are reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guyon et al. (2006)</ref>. We are here particularly interested in broadband behavior of coronagraphs and although a complete review of the broadband performance of all the existing coronagraphs is not within the scope of this paper, we provide here some numbers from the literature allowing to situate the presented work in the context of the state of the art. λ 0 and D denote the central wavelength of the spectral range ∆λ and the telescope aperture diameter respectively. The Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph ( <ref type="bibr">Gay &amp; Rabbia 1996</ref>) was the first attempt to make a concept able to image faint substellar mass companions close to the star in white light. This device can theoretically offer an intensity level of 1.6 · 10 −5 at a distance of λ 0 /D from the star over a bandwidth (∆λ/λ 0 ) of 18% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baudoz et al. 2000</ref>). The Apodized Pupil Lyot coronagraph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aime et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Soummer et al. 2003a</ref>), a more recent concept, is one of the most popular designs, adopted for the forthcoming generation of exoplanet imagers (e.g. VLT-SPHERE, Gemini Planet Imager, Palomar P1640). It can theoretically reach an intensity level lower than 10 −7 at 5 λ 0 /D over a bandwidth of 20%, in the presence of a telescope aperture with central obstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aime 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Soummer 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Soummer et al. 2011</ref>). Band-limited coronagraphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kuchner &amp; Traub 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuchner et al. 2005</ref>) also represent encouraging solutions to produce very high contrast performance over large spectral bands. Recent studies predict for instance that these concepts using hybrid metal-dielectric masks and combined with a deformable mirror, set to generate a dark half field in the image plane, can provide an intensity level of 4.9 · 10 −10 at 3.5 λ 0 /D within this dark region, over a bandwidth of 20% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Moody et al. 2008</ref>). The Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA, Guyon 2003) and its avatars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guyon et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Martinache et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pluzhnik et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Guyon et al. 2010a</ref>) constitute some of the most promising solutions for Earth-like planet detection. Indeed, an intensity level of 10 −10 at 1.5 λ 0 /D over a 21% bandwidth is predicted with an hybrid coronagraph composed of PIAA with a classical apodization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pluzhnik et al. 2006</ref>). Stellar coronagraphs using a phase mask in the focal plane represent some encouraging solutions to achieve the requested contrast levels, either in the form of sectorized masks (Four Quadrant Phase Mask <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Rouan et al. 2000]</ref> and Eight Octant Phase Mask <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Murakami et al. 2008]</ref>) or circular masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Roddier &amp; Roddier 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. 2003b</ref>). These systems are characterized by their very small inner working angles (IWAs) and good starlight rejection capabilities. Achromatization of these phase mask coronagraphs has been intensively studied in the past few years to improve the capability of these concepts to work in broad spectral bands. For sectorized phase masks, the use of achromatic half-wave plates leads to intensity levels of 5 · 10 −5 at 2.5 λ 0 /D from the star over a 20% bandwidth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mawet et al. 2006</ref>). Derived from the FQPM concept, the vector vortex coronagraph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mawet et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mawet et al. , 2010</ref>) also provides achromatic solutions. Using Liquid Crystal Polymers (LCP) for the manufacturing of such phase mask, intensity levels lower than 1.4 · 10 −7 at 3 λ 0 /D for a 15% bandwidth can theoretically be reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mawet et al. 2005</ref>), and further improvements are expected using a 3-layer LCP structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mawet et al. 2010</ref>). Achromatization of circular phase mask coronagraphs by the use of dual zone phase structures has also been studied ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. 2003b</ref>), leading to intensity levels of 10 −6 at 3 λ/D for 20% bandwidth. We report on further improvements of this concept in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Circular phase mask coronagraphs</head><p>Focus is made here on stellar coronagraphs with circular axi-symmetrical phase masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Roddier &amp; Roddier 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. 2003b</ref>). This is a promising concept, well suited for any arbitrary aperture (clear aperture, centrally obstructed circular pupil, diluted pupil...) and free from blind axes in the coronagraphic images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roddier &amp; Roddier (1997)</ref> proposed the first design, referred here as Roddier &amp; Roddier Phase Mask (RRPM), which was later improved by adding an entrance pupil apodizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guyon &amp; Roddier 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Soummer et al. 2003a</ref>). The corresponding system, called apodized pupil Roddier &amp; Roddier phase mask (ARPM) coronagraph, can theoretically achieve perfect starlight extinction at a single wavelength. Unfortunately, its performance decreases strongly in broadband observation. This loss of coronagraphic performance comes from chromatism effects related to the inherent properties of the RRPM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref> proposed an improvement of the ARPM coronagraph to overcome the problem of chromaticity, replacing the simple phase mask of the Roddier coronagraph with a double phase mask, named Dual Zone Phase Mask (DZPM). With this innovative coronagraph which also includes pupil apodization, they showed that an intensity level of ∼ 10 −6 can theoretically be reached at a 3 λ 0 /D angular distance from the star. These promising results were achieved both for a clear circular aperture and for an entrance pupil with 14% central obscuration ratio, in both cases considering a 20% bandwidth. Although encouraging, the performance of this coronagraphic system needs to be enlarged so as to realize spectro-imaging observations of the faintest close-in companions with this concept. The DZPM coronagraph has been originally designed considering a grey (or achromatic) entrance pupil apodization. This component then applies the same transmission function to the incident beam over the whole spectral bandwidth of study. The apodization shape is possibly not optimal at all the wavelengths of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.">Objectives of the paper</head><p>The aim of this paper is twofold. First of all, we investigate the possibility of using a colored (or chromatic) instead of a grey apodization to improve the contrast gain delivered by the DZPM coronagraph over the whole spectral bandwidth. This innovative concept will be named Colored Apodizer Phase Mask (CAPM) coronagraph. Secondly, once the apodization parameters optimized, we propose to analyze the sensitivity of the CAPM coronagraph by estimating the impact of different effects which may alter its performance in a realistic case. In Section 2, we briefly review the principle of the DZPM coronagraph and state the possibility of upgrading this concept with the use of a colored apodization. The methodology, applied to optimize numerically the parameters of the CAPM coronagraph, is thereafter described in Section 3. We present the theoretical performance achieved by this coronagraphic device for different spectral bandwidths and a clear circular aperture in Section 4. In addition, manufacturing aspects are addressed in Section 5 with the development of a physical design for the colored apodization and the performance study for the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of this component. The sensitivity of the CAPM coronagraph to different errors is thereafter analyzed in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The CAPM coronagraph</head><p>The principle of the DZPM coronagraph is recalled in the following before introducing our proposal, the CAPM coronagraph and its colored apodization. We then expose the formalism of this latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Principle of the DZPM coronagraph</head><p>An illustration of the DZPM coronagraphic layout is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, detailing the typical four planes of Lyot style coronagraphs. The DZPM coronagraph combines an apodization in the entrance pupil plane A, a DZPM in the following focal plane B and a Lyot stop in the re-imaged pupil plane C. The coronagraphic image forms in the final image plane D in which a detector is located. The optical design is such that the complex amplitudes of the electric field in two successive planes are related one to each other by a Fourier transform operation. The DZPM is designed as a circular phase disk of diameter d 1 surrounded by an annular phase ring of diameter d 2 , see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  2</ref>. Each diameter is equal to a very precise fraction of the size of the Airy disk. The inner and outer parts of the mask introduce some phase shifts ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 respectively, to the incoming wavefront in the focal plane B. As the wavelength increases, ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 decrease and the stellar diffraction pattern expands. This combination of effects leads to a decrease of the relative flux passing through the inner zone, while the flux passing through the annular zone increases. At a given wavelength, the complex amplitude of the field in the relayed pupil plane C corresponds to the result of the interference between the direct wave with the waves delayed by the two phase shift zones of the DZPM. This sum of wavefronts varies with the wavelength since ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 and the areas of the diffraction pattern covered by the mask also evolve with the wavelength. With an adequate choice of the DZPM parameters, the recombination of these three wavefronts in plane C generates destructive interferences inside the geometric pupil for a wide range of wavelengths. The light is rejected outside of this relayed pupil and blocked by a Lyot stop, leading to a broadband suppression of the star image at the detector in plane D. In addition, the presence of an entrance pupil apodization in plane A allows us to match well the direct wave with the waves diffracted by the DZPM. It results in improved destructive interference over the relayed pupil. A lower amount of the residual starlight is then found inside this pupil and therefore, a better starlight extinction is observed in the final image plane D. As was shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref>, further improvements can be achieved by adding a slight defocus of the coronagraph mask, which is equivalent to allocate a complex term in our apodization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Replacement of the grey by a colored apodization</head><p>A complex apodization in the coronagraphic scheme allows the direct wave and the waves diffracted by the DZPM to match well within the geometric pupil image and interfere destructively over it. In their design, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref> considered a grey version of the complex apodization. Since the waves diffracted by  the mask evolve with the wavelength, they do not match well the direct wave at all the wavelengths. Ideally, a complex apodization has to be found for each wavelength to obtain an achromatic nulling recombination of the direct with the diffracted waves. The design improvement proposed here from the DZPM coronagraph is similar to the approach developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aime (2005)</ref> for the Prolate apodized Lyot coronagraph. The idea consists in replacing the grey by a colored apodization in our coronagraphic system. This colored apodization constitutes an amplitude apodization and hence, intensity apodization variable with the wavelength. This change in apodization leads to the design of CAPM coronagraph which combines a colored apodization, a DZPM in the following focal plane and a Lyot stop in the relayed pupil plane. With this innovative coronagraphic system, we expect to reach contrast levels larger than those achieved by the DZPM coronagraph over a finite spectral bandwidth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Formalism</head><p>In the following, the formalism common to DZPM and CAPM coronagraphs is given. For the sake of clarity, we omit the position vector r, its modulus r and the wavelength λ in the equations below. F symbolizes the Fourier transform operator in which we include the Fourier Optics scaling factor 1/λ f , with f the telescope focal length <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goodman 1996</ref>). The complex amplitude of the field Ψ A at the aperture is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ψ A = P Φ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>in which P defines the telescope aperture shape whereas Φ denotes the complex apodization.</p><p>The DZPM is located in the following focal plane B. Its amplitude transmission function t can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t = 1 − (e iϕ 2 − e iϕ 1 ) M 1 − (1 − e iϕ 2 ) M 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>in which M 1 and M 2 define the top-hat functions of the inner and outer parts of the DZPM; they are equal to 1 for |r| &lt; d 1 /2 and |r| &lt; d 2 /2 respectively and 0 otherwise. Let us remind that ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 represent the phase shifts introduced by the mask in its inner and outer parts respectively, at a given wavelength. The complex amplitude of the field Ψ B after the mask is then given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Ψ B = 1 − (e iϕ 2 − e iϕ 1 ) M 1 − (1 − e iϕ 2 ) M 2 F [Ψ A ] .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The DZPM and CAPM coronagraphs belong to the class of the Lyot-style coronagraphs which consist in a succession of binary filters (pupil, finite-size focal plane mask, Lyot stop). We then adopt the semi-analytical approach suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Soummer et al. (2007)</ref> in the case of a Lyot-style coronagraph for a better understanding of the interference effects occurring in the pupil plane C. The complex amplitude after the Lyot stop Ψ C is expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ψ C = Ψ A L − (e iϕ 2 − e iϕ 1 ) F [F [Ψ A ]M 1 ] L − (1 − e iϕ 2 ) F [F [Ψ A ]M 2 ] L ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>in which L denotes the index function of the Lyot stop. Ψ C is the sum of three terms which represent the direct wave Ψ A and the sum of the waves diffracted by the inner and outer parts of the DZPM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Parameters of the CAPM coronagraph</head><p>Several parameters are involved in the CAPM coronagraph. d 1 , d 2 and the phase steps, expressed in optical path differences OPD 1 and OPD 2 , correspond to the characteristics related to the DZPM. The other parameters refer to the complex apodization Φ which can be decomposed into the product of an amplitude and a phase apodizations Φ a and Φ w respectively:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Φ = Φ a · Φ w .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Following the indications of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref>, the transmission function chosen for Φ a is a radial symmetric fourth order polynomial while Φ w is in the form of a defocus of the mask. This amplitude transmission function finds its maximum value at the pupil center in the case of a clear aperture and at the edge of the central obscuration for a centrally obstructed circular aperture. For a given central obscuration ratio η (null for a clear aperture), the amplitude apodization Φ a can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Φ a (r, λ) = 1 + ω 1,λ r 2 − η 2 4 + ω 2,λ r 4 − η 4 16 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ω 1,λ and ω 2,λ denote the colored parameters related to the amplitude apodization Φ a .

Manufacturing aspects on the chromatic defocus are discussed below in Section 5. As mentioned above, ω 1,λ , ω 2,λ and β λ are chromatic parameters since we deal here with a colored apodization. They will be optimized at each wavelength of the spectral bandwidth with the criteria given below. Let us note that the previous expressions of apodization are still valid for the DZPM coronagraph, with ω 1,λ , ω 2,λ and β λ remaining constant over the spectral bandwidth.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Computation of the amplitude in plane C</head><p>The complex amplitude Ψ C in pupil plane C is computed following Eq.(4). This semi-analytical expression is advantageous in terms of computation time since Fourier transform operations are only required within the mask area of width ∼ λ 0 /D in the focal plane B and within the Lyot stop area in plane C. No zeropadding is required in this case so we can use arrays of width equal to the mask diameter. We apply the algorithm, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Soummer et al. (2007)</ref>, based on the matrix Fourier transform (MFT) to compute these truncated Fourier transform and evaluate Ψ C .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Computation of the amplitude in plane D</head><p>The complex amplitude Ψ D in image plane D is obtained with a Fourier transform of the complex amplitude Ψ C , see Eq.(5). We want to evaluate this complex amplitude over a large field of view (FoV), typically from 50 to 200 λ 0 /D width with good sampling. This can be seen as a truncated Fourier transform within the area of interest (here, FoV) like in the case of Ψ B and the MFT can be used again. However, the computation proves to be slow since an array much larger than that used in plane B is involved. While this increase in computation time is not dramatic in the monochromatic case, it becomes important when we consider a broadband image for which several monochromatic images are computed and summed. For fast computation of Ψ D from Ψ C , we apply a novel method based on a succession of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) instead of the MFT. By this method, already experimented in the context of James Webb Space Telescope PSF calculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zamkotsian &amp; Dohlen 2004</ref>), the diameter in pixels of the geometric pupil in plane C is assumed to be equal to N C0 . Ψ C is represented in an array C 0 with dimensions N C0 × N C0 .

(2003b)</ref> optimized the parameters of the DZPM coronagraph to achieve the best on-axis extinction of the stellar diffraction pattern in the image plane. We decide here to optimize the CAPM coronagraph parameters in order to reach the best off-axis cancellation of the star image. This will yield minimal starlight pollution in the search area in which exoplanets are expected to be found. The search area is defined by an annulus of width between 2 λ 0 /D and 10 λ 0 /D from the main optical axis in the image plane.</p><p>We average the intensity of the monochromatic coronagraphic image over this search area. This calculus is performed at five different wavelengths uniformly distributed within the spectral bandwidth. Once this done, we compute a merit function M to estimate the quadratic sum of the mean intensities reached at each wavelength λ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">M = λ n λ 1 ρ O ρ I |Ψ D | 2 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where ρ I and ρ O are the inner and outer radii of the search area and λ 1 and λ n represent the first and n-th wavelengths of study within the spectral bandwidth. For our optimization, 5 wavelengths from λ 1 to λ 5 have been considered within the spectral bandwidth ∆λ, centered on λ 3 = λ 0 , and equally spaced from one to another by ∆λ/5, see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Some test optimizations have also been run with an eleven wavelengths gridding for 25% and 50% bands, showing no improvement of the coronagraph performance with respect to the five wavelength sampling. A numerical least-squares method is used to obtain the CAPM coronagraph parameters (d 1 , d 2 , ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , ω 1,λ , ω 2,λ , β λ ) that minimize our merit function and therefore, achieve the lowest averaged intensity over the search area for simultaneously all the wavelengths. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.

An interpolation of the values is realized for each apodization parameter. After several tests, we decide to use a second degree polynomial function to fit the parameter values, more representative of the behavior of actual materials than higher order functions. In the following, all our interpolations are performed with a second degree polynomial function. Once this defined, we can estimate the values of the parameter at a given wavelength and compute its frame. We then sum several monochromatic images with small spectral separation between two successive frames and obtain our broadband image in plane D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Performance over large spectral bandwidths</head><p>In this section, we study the behavior of the CAPM coronagraph and its theoretical performance for different spectral bandwidths. This investigation is made for a clear circular aperture but it can be generalized to any kind of entrance pupil geometry. The current study will be particularly interesting in the context of some exoplanet imagers under consideration, such as 1-2 m class off-axis space telescopes equipped with an internal coronagraph (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Galicher et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Trauger et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guyon et al. 2010c</ref>). In addition, the results reached with our concept are compared to those previously achieved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref> with the DZPM coronagraph. This allows us to underline the contrast gain obtained with the use of a colored apodization instead of a grey one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Colored apodization</head><p>Let us first observe the shape of the apodization reached for the CAPM coronagraph at different wavelengths. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> panel (a) shows the radial intensity profiles of the colored apodization at five wavelengths for a 25% bandwidth (H-band). We can notice the similarity between all the displayed profiles. To disentangle them, the difference between the transmission functions at a given wavelength λ and at λ 0 has been drawn on the panel (b), emphasizing small difference in absolute value existing between different profiles. The intensity difference is not larger than 3% of the normalized intensity peak but it reveals the chromatic aspect of our apodization used for the CAPM coronagraph. The apodization throughput evolves slightly from 57.9% (λ = 1.485 µm) to 55.3% (λ = 1.815 µm).</p><p>The panels (c) and (d) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> show the phase ϕ of the phase apodization Φ w = e iϕ in a similar way.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Residual intensity</head><p>Much information can be extracted from the monochromatic intensity profiles in the Lyot and image planes, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref>. These curves have been obtained considering the optimized apodizer showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. The minimization of the residual broadband intensity inside the search area (2-10 λ 0 /D range) has driven the optimization of our CAPM concept, leading to coronagraphic images with high intensity peak and low sidelobe level, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> bottom plot. In parallel, the energy distribution inside the Lyot stop exhibits apodized intensity profiles, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> top plot. Observing all the wavelengths, we note that the brightness of the sidelobes beyond 6 λ 0 /D angular separation follows the intensity value found at the pupil edge. For sidelobes in the 2-6 λ 0 /D range, this assertion is no longer valid because of the combination of several effects, including oscillations of the amplitude for some wavelengths in the Lyot plane as well as the presence of a phase apodization in the entrance pupil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Optimized parameters</head><p>Following our optimization criteria, we estimate the different parameters of the CAPM coronagraph for different spectral bandwidths. The obtained values are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. In addition, the colored apodization parameters ω 1,λ , ω 2,λ and β λ are plotted as a function of the wavelength for different bandwidths in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>.  Profiles have been normalized at the origin to directly read the coronagraphic extinction ratio at a given angular distance from the on-axis star image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Contrast results and discussion</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>, we draw the radial intensity profile of the images achieved with the CAPM coronagraph for different spectral bandwidths. The plotted curves are extracted from polychromatic images computed with N=1+100 ∆λ/λ 0 monochromatic frames with a separation corresponding to 1% band. The values of the averaged intensities reached for each band and at several angular separations are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Averaged intensities of 2.2 · 10 −7 and 2.2 · 10 −8 are theoretically reached at 3 λ 0 /D and 5 λ 0 /D respectively, with our coronagraphic device for a 25% bandwidth. As we can notice in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, the interpolation function is not optimal for the largest bands, leading to a loss of coronagraph performance when the optimized parameters are replaced by the interpolated values: the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D degrades from 3.8 · 10 −8 and 7.1 · 10 −8 to 5.0 · 10 −8 and 1.3 · 10 −7 for the 40% and 50% bands respectively.</p><p>To go further in the analysis, we also determine the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D achieved by the coronagraph at each wavelength of a given spectral bandwidth case, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9</ref>. Each curve is plotted with the same 1% sampling as described above. It can be noticed from this plot that a 2 · 10 −8 averaged intensity at ∼ λ 0 can theoretically be achieved in the case of a 25% bandwidth. Another interesting aspect about reachable averaged intensities concerns the spectral range. As the bandwidth decreases below 20%, a single hole in the intensity curve appears around λ 0 , surrounded by increasingly steep edges. In the monochromatic case, the coronagraph becomes identical to the ARPM coronagraph as we could expect. Finally in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we compare the results achieved with the CAPM coronagraph with those obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. (2003b)</ref> with the DZPM coronagraph. It can be noticed that a ∼2.5 mag contrast gain at 3 λ 0 /D is reached with our device compared with the first DZPM coronagraph design for a 20% and a 40% bandwidths. Similar improvements of the reachable averaged intensities have been observed at other angular separations (5 and 7 λ 0 /D), confirming the substantial gain obtained for the CAPM coronagraph by replacing the grey by a colored apodization.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Design proposal for the colored apodization</head><p>The realization of a colored apodizer is a key point for the implementation of the CAPM coronagraph. This requires careful control of the transmission function of the apodizer both spatially across the pupil and spectrally over a wide range of wavelengths. We expose here some of the options currently investigated for the fabrication of this chromatic apodization. One option consists of using an absorbing material with an appropriate chromatic variation of the absorption coefficient, for instance a colored-glass filter. The required transmission function for the apodizer is obtained at all the wavelengths by careful thickness control of the absorbing material. Appropriate material choice would lead to a negative lens of up to a few mm edge thickness. The optical power of this lens could possibly be included in the optical design of the instrument, but in a more general option it would need to be compensated by a positively powered non-absorbing lens. Another approach for the colored apodizer that we have considered is to use a thin film of a highly absorbing material such as metal, deposited with an appropriate radial thickness profile onto a silica substrate. The chromaticity of the apodizer is now related to the chromatic variation of the complex refractive index of the material. ). Our study is focused here on the search of metals to design chromatic components instead of grey masks.</p><p>In the following, we detail this approach for the realization of the colored apodization. The performance of the CAPM coronagraph is estimated with this physical design and then compared to the results with the theoretical model of colored apodizer described above. We assume a clear circular aperture and a 25% bandwidth centered at λ 0 = 1.65 µm (H-band) for our optimization.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Assembly based on a metallic thin film on a silica substrate</head><p>For the manufacturing of our colored amplitude apodization Φ a , we investigate an assembly based on a metallic thin film deposited on a silica substrate with complex refractive index N m and N s respectively, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. At the boundaries of our assembly, we consider an absorption-free medium of refractive index N 0 . The assembly is assumed to work in transmission at normal incidence. The substrate is supposed to be an absorption-free medium, thick enough to neglect the internal reflections. Referring to the metallic thin film, the refractive index N m presents a complex part, called extinction coefficient k, which is related to the absorption α m within the metal layer by α m = 4πk/λ. Increasing the metal thickness leads to a combined enhancement of the absorption and reflection of the assembly and therefore, a reduction of its transmission. A careful control of the metallic thin film thickness allows us to adjust the amplitude transmission function of our assembly. The chromaticity of the amplitude apodization is mainly due to the dependence on wavelength of the metal extinction coefficient. For the present concept, the amplitude transmission function of our assembly Φ b is defined as the product of the transmittances through the metallic thin film and the substrate τ m and τ s respectively. The amplitude apodization can therefore be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Φ b (r, λ) =τ m (r, λ)τ s (λ) ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>For the sake of clarity, we omit the dependence on wavelength of the refractive indices and the parameters B, C and δ m which appear in the following equations. The transmittances in amplitude τ m and τ s can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">τ m (r, λ) =2N 0 /(N 0 B + C) , τ s (λ) =2N s /(N s + N 0 ) ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where B and C can be identified as the normalized electric and magnetic field amplitudes at the front interface respectively <ref type="bibr">(MacLeod 1991)</ref>. In our case, B and C can be calculated with the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">B C = cos δ m (i sin δ m )/N m iN m sin δ m cos δ m 1 N s<label>(14)</label></formula><p>with δ m (r, λ) = 2πN m t(r)/λ the phase shift experienced by the wave as it traverses a distance t normal to the substrate boundary. The complex apodization Φ of the CAPM coronagraph with the physical design writes as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Φ = Φ b · Φ w .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>The metallic thin film also induces a radially variable phase delay, leading to complex values evolving with r for the transmission function Φ b . Since our concept of CAPM coronagraph also contains a phase apodization Φ w , the total phase of the complex apodization Φ in the entrance pupil plane A will be the combination of the phase terms of Φ w and Φ b .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Choice of the metal</head><p>Preliminary studies have been realized to choose the metal for the physical model, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. Five metals (gold, silver, aluminum, nickel and chromium) have been considered for this purpose while five radial distances have been investigated to determine the optimal thickness of the metallic thin film at different positions in the pupil. For each metal and radial distance, the thickness of the metallic thin film has been estimated such that the assembly reaches the same intensity transmission as the theoretical model at λ 0 observed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>. Bulk refractive indices for the metal layer, obtained from Palik (1985), have been used for the implementation of our simulations. The thicknesses reached for each metal and radial distance are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Using silver or nickel provides the best fit to the theoretical model at small or large radial distances, respectively. However, even with those metals, the theoretical profile of the colored apodization is not reached at all the wavelengths of study. In the following, we re-optimize the CAPM coronagraph, using a nickel apodizer. With reference to the apodizer model of Eq. (8), the thickness profile t of the metal is optimized using the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">t(r) = t c χ 1 r 2 − η 2 4 + χ 2 r 4 − η 4 16 ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where t c = 1 nm is the reference thin film thickness and χ 1 and χ 2 are the parameters related to the terms in r 2 and r 4 respectively of the thickness profile. This assembly provides a maximum amplitude transmission at the center of the pupil or at the edge of the central obscuration for η 0. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Results</head><p>The optimized parameters for the phase mask and apodizer are reported in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> while the resulting thickness profile t of the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>nickel film and the parameter β λ associated to the phase apodization are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. Regarding t displayed in the top plot, a maximum thickness of 9.1 nm is reached at the pupil edge for the metal layer, proving to be consistent with the 9.7 nm value observed at r = 0.5 in the tests for the choice of the metal and reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Concerning the β λ curve in the bottom plot, we can note some discrepancy between the values obtained for the CAPM coronagraphs working with the theoretical model and the physical design. This difference can be explained by the presence of the additional phase shifting introduced by the metallic thin film of the assembly, leading to a re-adjustment of the parameter β λ of the chromatic defocus during the optimization of the CAPM coronagraph with the physical design. The radial intensity profiles of the apodizer for a 25% bandwidth (H-band) are represented at five wavelengths in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> panel (a). While the profiles are quite similar to the profiles shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, the difference between them, shown in panel (b), are smaller than for the optimal profiles. The apodization throughput of the assembly ranges from 59.5% (λ = 1.485 µm) to 58.8% (λ = 1.815 µm), which is slightly higher than the theoretical colored apodizer. The phase profiles, shown in panel (c), are somewhat different from those of the optimal apodizer in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, indicating the presence of a fourth-order term (spherical aberration) in addition to the second order term. The differential phase profiles in panel (d) are remarcably similar to those of the opti-mal apodizer, both in shape and amplitude. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>, we represent the intensity profiles obtained with the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of the theoretical colored apodizer and our physical design. The profiles are almost identical, underlining the good relevance of using a nickel layer to realize our colored amplitude apodization. The intensity levels estimated at different separations from the star are thus very close for the two models of colored amplitude apodization, see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. For instance, the intensity levels at 5 λ 0 /D are 2.6 · 10 −8 and 2.2 · 10 −8 , respectively. An optimized design using a nickel thin film therefore allows us to reproduce the contrast results obtained for the optimal CAPM coronagraph. The nickel layer presents a maximum thickness of 9.1 nm with an accurate control at atomic level. To manufacture such a design, atomic layer deposition (ALD) represents a very attractive technique, widely used in microelectronics, since it enables the production of very thin, conformal film with thickness control and composition of the films at the atomic level for a large range of materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Leskel &amp; Ritala 2002)</ref>. Further studies and tests will be required for the manufacturing of such chromatic apodizers. Finally, options based on more elaborate, radially variable thin film stacks, possibly containing both dielectric and metallic materials, are also being considered. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Values of the parameters for the CAPM coronagraph optimized with an assembly using nickel thin film for the colored apodization. The DZPM phase steps are given in optical path difference (OPD).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Implementation of the chromatic defocus</head><p>The colored apodizer also includes phase apodization Φ w with a chromatic parameter β λ . While grey phase apodization can simply be realized by defocussing the mask, we address here the possibility to produce a chromatic defocus. Our numerical optimization shows that parameter β λ varies as λ 2 for the theoretical model and our physical design, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. A possible way to realize a 2 nd degree polynomial chromatic defocus consists in using a powerless doublet at the entrance pupil plane. This doublet will present the following characteristics: infinite focal length at λ 0 , a null 1 st order chromatic dispersion and a constant and non null 2 nd order chromatic dispersion, also called anomalous dispersion. This can be achieved by combining glasses which have the same refractive indices n 1 and n 2 , the same Abbe numbers ν 1 and ν 2 , but different partial dispersions. This work follows Duplov (2006) who has recently realized studies of apochromatic lens design by considering the partial dispersion properties of materials from standard glass catalogs rather than special anomalous-dispersion glasses. We have performed preliminary tests of this approach in the visible range using ZEMAX R ray tracing code and tabulated glass data. Encouraging results for the realization of our phase apodization were found with a combination of Schott glass materials N-FK9 and K5, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>. Indeed, chromatic behavior in λ 2 is obtained with this doublet, corresponding to the chromatic defocus expected for the phase apodization of our CAPM coronagraph. Combination of other glass materials are currently under study to achieve adequate chromatic defocus in other spectral bands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Sensitivity analysis</head><p>After optimizing the CAPM coronagraph for achromatization, we investigate here several effects that may alter the performance provided by this coronagraphic system. In the following sensitivity analysis, we consider a CAPM coronagraph optimized for a 25% bandwidth (H-band) observing a point-like source, except for the star angular size study, in the case of a clear circular aperture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Performance criteria</head><p>Contrast performance is judged by the averaged intensity estimated at 5 λ 0 /D from the main optical axis in the image plane and for an annulus of width λ 0 /D. To quantify the capacity to work close to the star, the Inner Working Angle (IWA) is often used, defining the minimum angular distance at which the throughput of a companion is larger than 50%. Phase mask coronagraphs offer very small IWA, typically ∼ λ 0 /D, as recalled for instance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Martinez et al. (2008)</ref>. This is the case for the CAPM coronagraph as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref>. Unfortunately, IWA is not related to the notion of contrast and therefore, the intensity of close-in companions detectable at a given angular distance from the star cannot be determined with this benchmark. We propose a new criterion, named Inner Detectability Angle (IDA), which represents the compromise between IWA and achievable contrast. IDA is defined as the minimum angular distance α from the main optical axis for which the ratio between the normalized intensity of our coronagraphic star image and the planet transmission flux T p is less than a given value, here set to 10 −6 : where I 0 denotes the intensity peak value in the absence of coronagraph mask. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref>, we plot the planet transmission profile as a function of the planet position in the presence of a CAPM coronagraph optimized for a 25% bandwidth. From this curve, we deduce that the planet transmission can reasonably be taken equal to 1 for distances larger than 1.5 λ 0 /D. IDA is expected to be larger than IWA, but estimating IDA allows us to know at which angular distance companions, 10 −6 fainter than their host star, could be detected with our CAPM coronagraph.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">I D (α) I 0 × 1 T p (α) ≤ 10 −6 ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>We study the evolution of IDA for the different cases described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Effects of aberrations</head><p>Wavefront errors constitute a major issue for stellar coronagraphs as they limit the performance provided by these diffraction suppression systems. This crucial point of aberrations then has to be addressed in the framework of a coronagraphic planet imager. In the case of a ground-based telescope with an XAO system, as in the case of a well-corrected space instrument, the residual quasi-static instrumental aberrations are known to affect the intensity level reached by a downstream coronagraphic device. A performance estimate of the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of aberrations is therefore required to know the sensitivity of our device. In the following, we describe the behavior of our coronagraphic concept in the presence of low-order aberrations (tip-tilt, defocus, astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration) since they represent the main contribution in terms of wavefront errors. In addition, we analyze the impact of random aberrations caused by real optical elements on the CAPM coronagraph performance. This aims to determine the limits of our system in the presence of light scattered by the surface roughness of optical elements. The low-order aberrations are decomposed here following the Zernike polynomials basis. Their amount is expressed in Zernike rms coefficients and given in λ 0 unit. The random aberrations considered here are related to the wavefront errors introduced by real optical elements. Good quality optical surfaces are found to exhibit a power spectral density (PSD) function proportional to ν −2 where ν denotes the spatial frequency in the pupil, as recalled for instance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Roddier &amp; Roddier (1997)</ref>. To realize our study with random aberrations, we introduce numerically a randomly aberrated phase screen following this PSD, in the entrance pupil plane A of our coronagraph. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref> gives a set of the images theoretically obtained with the CAPM coronagraph. These frames are represented for different values of rms wavefront errors and each aberration considered here. The shape of the coronagraphic image modifies and evolves quickly as the amount of the rms wavefront errors increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.">Qualitative analysis</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>, we draw the radial intensity profiles of the coronagraphic images obtained with the CAPM coronagraph for different rms wavefront error values of defocus (top plot), spherical aberration (middle plot) and random aberration (bottom plot).</p><p>Through the evolution of the profile with the amount of a given aberration, one can appreciate the variation of the IDA and the intensity level reached with the CAPM coronagraph. A dashed line representing the 10 −6 intensity level set for IDA is also displayed on the plot. We note that while both low-order and random aberrations affect all angular separations, the low-order profiles remain parallel with the non-aberrated profile, following a α −3 law, as in the case of the classical Airy pattern. In the random aberrations case, on the other hand, the profile changes towards a α −2 profile, corresponding to the PSD profile defined above. We conclude that mechanism leading to performance degradation is different in the two cases. While edge diffraction dominates in the low-order case, wavefront diffraction, as modeled by a sum of phase gratings (Goodman 1996) dominates in the random case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Intensity &amp; IDA</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref> top plot, we represent the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D achieved by the CAPM coronagraph as a function of the rms wavefront errors value. The averaged intensity goes beyond a 10 −7 value for rms wavefront errors value larger than ∼ 3 · 10 −3 λ 0 and ∼ 9 · 10 −4 λ 0 for low-order and random aberrations respectively. At greatest aberration values, the reachable averaged intensity increases approximately as a 2 nd degree polynomial function for all the aberrations. Let us note that in the case of a spherical aberration, a small and local improvement of the coronagraph performance is observed for a wavefront error of ∼ 7 · 10 −4 λ 0 rms with respect to the reference averaged intensity value in the absence of aberration. We deduce that an additional phase apodization in the form of spherical aberration can slightly improve the contrast gain provided by this device but the investigation of this effect is not within the scope of this paper. However, the gain at 5 λ 0 /D implies a non desirable increase in intensity of the first Airy ring, see the 10 −3 λ 0 rms profile in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>  and a second degree polynomial function for the low-order and random aberrations respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3.">Discussion</head><p>The intensity level and IDA provided by CAPM coronagraph are all the more altered as the aberration order is higher. These results show that at a given value of rms aberration, the sensitivity of our coronagraph increases with the order of the aberration. They also underline the necessity of working with very high quality optical elements, typically better than 10 −3 λ 0 rms wavefront error, to enable high performance of the CAPM coronagraph for a very high contrast imaging as well as a very small IDA. Several studies of sensitivity to low-order aberrations have been performed for different kinds of coronagraph (e.g <ref type="bibr">Shaklan &amp; Green 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Belikov et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mawet et al. 2010)</ref>. No general behavior of the coronagraphs to low-order aberrations emerge from the previous analysis since each concept presents a specific response to these wavefront errors. In addition and to the best of our knowledge, no advanced study has been reported on the response of circular phase mask coronagraphs to low-order aberrations.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Effects of mask imperfections</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1.">Mask roughness</head><p>Effects of the mask roughness have to be analyzed since they could alter the performance of the CAPM coronagraph. Many glass substrates with excellent flatness (better than λ/20, see for instance Newport R 10QW40-30 glass) are available and useful for our DZPM manufacturing. To lead our study, we therefore assume a perfectly flat substrate of the DZPM except where the phase disk and annulus are machined into it. So, only effects of surface roughness present inside the mask area of diameter d 2 have been considered. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> top plot, we draw the radial profile of the coronagraphic image for different values of rms mask roughness. All the coronagraphic profiles follow a α −3 law as that of the Airy diffraction pattern does and their intensity level increases with the amount of rms mask roughness. Following this result, we also represent the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D reached by the CAPM coronagraph as a function of the rms mask roughness, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref> top plot. It can be noticed that a 10 −7 intensity level is provided with the CAPM coronagraph for rms mask roughness values lower than ∼ 0.12 λ 0 . Beyond this value, the intensity increases and follows the behavior of a 2 nd degree polynomial function until it reaches a plateau at 2 ·10 −5 , corresponding to the non-coronagraphic case, for roughness greater than 1.00 λ 0 rms. In addition, the IDA profile is displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref> bottom plot. A 3 λ 0 /D IDA is preserved for rms mask roughness value lower than 0.15 λ 0 . For larger roughness values, the IDA increases and follows a 1 st degree polynomial function, again reaching a plateau at 1.00 λ 0 rms. For 0.12 λ 0 rms mask roughness, the corresponding values are 198.0 nm and 76.0 nm at λ 0 = 1650 nm (H-band) and at λ 0 = 633 nm (visible) respectively. As a reference, the roughness obtained with our second-generation RRPM is 0.8 nm rms (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2010</ref>). Since the same accuracy can be obtained for the manufacturing of DZPM as for that of the RRPM, we can deduce that mask roughness will not constitute a major issue for the CAPM coronagraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2.">Mask transition zone width</head><p>The DZPM is theoretically a hard-edge mask. However in practice, some transition zone widths are found in a manufactured prototype as noticed with the second-generation RRPM (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2010</ref>). We propose to study the impact of the DZPM transition width on the CAPM coronagraph performance by replacing vertical transitions by slopes in the mask shape. The same width is assumed here for the inner and outer parts of the DZPM and expressed in mask outer part diameter d 2 . The transition zone is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Radial profiles of the coronagraphic images are displayed for different mask transition widths in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref> bottom plot. All the profiles evolve as a 3 rd degree polynomial function like the Airy diffraction pattern. As expected, the intensity values of the coronagraphic image increase as the DZPM transition zone width becomes larger. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref> top plot, we display the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D provided by the CAPM coronagraph as a function of the DZPM transition zone width. An intensity level of 10 −7 is preserved for a mask transition width smaller than 0.014 d 2 . At larger widths, the averaged intensity increases but slower than a 2 nd degree polynomial function. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref> bottom plot shows the evolution of IDA achieved with the CAPM coronagraph as a function of the mask transition width. We can notice that IDA remains below 3 λ 0 /D for a mask transition width lower than 0.028 d 2 . Beyond this value, IDA evolves as a 1/2 degree polynomial function, showing the low sensitivity of this criteria to an increase of the mask transition width. As a summary, a 1% mask transition width allows us to preserve a 10 −7 intensity level and good IDA with the CAPM coronagraph. This value is similar to that measured for the secondgeneration RRPM which was less than 1% of the mask diameter (N' <ref type="bibr">Diaye et al. 2010</ref>) and below 1 µm. The same accuracy is expected concerning the manufacturing of the DZPM. A 1% mask transition width corresponds physically to 1 µm for a 100 µm DZPM diameter. Hence, the focal ratio F of the coronagraphic layout will range as follows: F ∼ 61 at λ = 1.65 µm, F ∼ 100 at λ = 1 µm and F ∼ 200 at λ = 0.5 µm. Below a 1 µm wavelength, F constitutes a severe constrain on the design of a planet imager working in the visible and in which a CAPM coronagraph could be inserted. To overcome focal ratio issues in the visible spectral range, manufacturing DZPM with a diameter and mask transition width smaller than 100 µm and 1 µm respectively is required. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Lyot stop size</head><p>Pupil undersizing in the Lyot plane is often required in the context of instrument design to allow alignment and manufacturing tolerance. The sensitivity of the CAPM coronagraph to this parameter has therefore to be taken into account. We analyze the impact of a Lyot Stop (LS) size reduction on the contrast provided by the CAPM coronagraph. Two CAPM coronagraphs optimized with a 90% and a 100% LS are considered here. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 23</ref>, the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D achieved by the CAPM coronagraph is represented as a function of the pupil size for both designs. In each case, the best contrast provided by the CAPM coronagraph is almost obtained for the LS size for which the coronagraphic device has been optimized. However, the behavior of the CAPM coronagraphs differs from each other. In the case of the CAPM coronagraph optimized with a 100% LS, the intensity level increases from 2 ·10 −8 to 2 ·10 −7 as we reduce the size of the LS from 1 D to 0.85 D. On the opposite, in the case of the CAPM coronagraph optimized with a 90% LS, the intensity level varies slowly from 3 ·10 −8 to 5 ·10 −8 for LS sizes diverg- ing from 0.93 D. A grey area in the plot underlines the range of Lyot stop sizes for which weak fluctuations of the coronagraph performance are observed. The CAPM coronagraph optimized with 90% LS is less sensitive to Lyot Stop reduction than that optimized with 100% LS. So, pupil undersizing weakly alters the CAPM coronagraph performance if this coronagraphic system has been optimized considering the Lyot Stop size. Let us notice that in the case of a Lyot stop size larger than the geometric pupil diameter, the performance of the CAPM coronagraph decreases quickly as expected since the rejected starlight is found there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2.">Lyot stop misalignment</head><p>Lyot stop misalignment has been identified as one of the issues for the coronagraphs on VLT-SPHERE. A misalignment less than 0.2% of the pupil diameter has been imposed to the selected coronagraphs for the instrument requirements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beuzit et al. 2006</ref>). In the following, we analyze the impact of the Lyot Stop misalignment with respect to the geometric pupil on the CAPM coronagraph performance. The LS size is taken here equal to 90% the relayed pupil diameter D. Once again, we consider two CAPM coronagraphs: optimized with a 90% and 100% LS. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref>, the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D provided by the DZPM coronagraph is represented as a function of the Lyot Stop misalignment. In the absence of pupil misalignment, the intensity level achieved by the CAPM coronagraph optimized with a 90% LS and 100% LS are about 4 ·10 −8 and 8 ·10 −8 respectively. The result achieved by the CAPM coronagraph optimized to 90% LS is better than that optimized to 100% LS since we are facing a 90% LS in the coronagraphic scheme as mentionned above. As the pupil misalignment increases up to 0.05 D, the intensity level provided by the CAPM coronagraph does not really change significantly. Clearly, the CAPM coronagraph is not sensitive to pupil misalignment for a LS remaining completely inside the geometric pupil. Beyond a 0.05 D pupil misalignment, the Lyot Stop starts to go outside the geometric pupil image where most of the rejected starlight is found. It results in a very high increase of the averaged intensity and an expected dramatic diminution in performance for the CAPM coronagraph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Star angular size</head><p>A Sun-like star at 10 pc is 1 milliarcsec across, corresponding to 0.024 λ 0 /D and 0.125 λ 0 /D in H-band for a 8m-class telescope and the E-ELT respectively. Since phase mask coronagraphs are quite sensitive to star size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guyon et al. 2006</ref>), we analyze the impact of this latter on the performance of our concept. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 25</ref>, we plot the azimuthally averaged intensity profiles with the CAPM coronagraph for different star angular radii θ. All the profiles follow a α −3 law like the Airy diffraction pattern and the intensity values increase with θ, as expected. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  26</ref> top and bottom plots, we represent the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D and IDA respectively as a function of the star angular radius. In the top plot, the intensity level goes beyond 10 −7 for θ larger than 0.018 λ 0 /D. At larger angular radii, the intensity level increases as θ 2 . In bottom plot, a 3 λ 0 /D IDA is preserved for θ lower than 0.025 λ 0 /D. At larger values, IDA evolves as θ. As a consequence, the finite size of the sun-like star at 10 pc has little impact on the CAPM coronagraph when observed through an 8 m-class telescope. However, for a 40 m-class telescope, the finite size of this star clearly limits the coronagraphic performance. These results confirm the limitations observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guyon et al. (2006)</ref> about the circular phase mask coronagraphs for the direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets. In order to use the CAPM coronagraph at its optimal performance with an ELT, it is therefore more appropriate to observe more compact or more distant stellar objects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>The CAPM coronagraph is an original concept composed of a colored pupil apodization, a DZPM in the following focal plane and a Lyot Stop in the re-imaged pupil plane. This diffraction suppression system constitutes an improved version of the DZPM coronagraph ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Soummer et al. 2003b</ref>) in which the grey apodization has been replaced by a colored one. This change allows us to increase the achromaticity of circular phase mask coronagraphs; indeed, a 2.5 mag contrast gain for the CAPM coronagraph is achieved with respect to the DZPM coronagraph. In addition, intensity levels of 2.2·10 −7 and 2.2·10 −8 at 3 λ 0 /D and 5 λ 0 /D respectively from the observed bright star are expected with the CAPM coronagraph, in the case of a clear aperture and a 25% bandwidth. This performance situates the concept in an excellent position with respect to similar concepts reviewed in the introduction to this paper. Manufacturing aspects of the colored apodizer have also been addressed, leading to a promising solution for the realization of our CAPM coronagraph using a nickel thin film for the colored amplitude apodizer. Optimizing the metallic layer thickness and mask parameters, we obtained the ultimate performance of the CAPM coronagraph. We consider to use a lens doublet combining two glasses with the same refractive index, the same Abbe number and different anomalous dispersion to produce colored phase apodization. An encouraging solution has been found for the visible range and studies are on-going to address other spectral bands with the same concept.</p><p>A sensitivity analysis of the CAPM coronagraph to different errors has also been performed, leading to the determination of the error level which can be accepted before the performance of the device is altered. We find in particular that for a given amount of rms wavefront errors, the concept is less sensitive to loworder than to high-order aberrations. While an intensity level at 5 λ 0 /D of 10 −7 is ensured for about 6 · 10 −3 λ 0 of tilt or defocus, the same intensity level requires spherical aberration less than 3 · 10 −3 λ 0 . In the case of random aberrations with a ν −2 PSD distribution, this intensity level requires wavefront errors below 10 −3 λ 0 . Similar observations are made in the case of close-in imaging capabilities, quantified by the Inner Detectability Angle (IDA). Constrains on DZPM design are quite relaxed at level of mask roughness (76 nm rms in the visible spectral range). However, they can prove to be critical in the case of the mask transition width where a value better than 1 µm is required if one wants to use our CAPM coronagraph within an exoplanet imager with a reasonable focal ratio (F less than 100) in the visible. Technological improvements of mask manufacturing are under development and some first prototypes are expected to be tested in our laboratory soon. In addition, we show that an optimization of the CAPM coronagraph with a 90% Lyot stop is helpful for this device to be less sensitive to pupil stop misalignments. Furthermore, the averaged intensity at 5 λ 0 /D remains lower than 10 −7 with our concept for a stellar angular size smaller than 0.018 λ 0 /D. Central obstruction and spiders effects have not been addressed here. They will be presented in a future paper with a design study and performance analysis of the CAPM coronagraph in the framework of the E-ELT. Finally, the CAPM coronagraph constitutes a very attractive concept for the planet imagers of the next decade thanks to its small inner working angle, its great ability to suppress broadband starlight and the relative simplicity of its design. The next step will now consist in manufacturing all the components of the CAPM coronagraph and performing an experimental demonstration of the concept. We are currently preparing a visible coronagraph testbed at LAM in Marseilles for this purpose.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

array D Thanks to these successive operations, a fast computation of Ψ D 
is achieved. To check the accuracy of our method, we compare 
the monochromatic intensity |Ψ D | 2 obtained with our ultrafast 
Fourier transform method and with a simple FFT (steps 1 to 3 are 
skipped here). We work with N the element resolution λ/D is sampled each 10 pixels in the im-
age plane. This leads to an absolute difference less than 2 ·10 −15 . 
This numerical noise remains largely below all the contrast val-
ues that we are considering here and therefore, it does not have 
an influence on the analysis of our results. This test allows us to 
confirm the accuracy of our ultrafast Fourier transform proposed 
here. In the following, we apply this algorithm to estimate Ψ D .
