<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Throughout recorded history, mankind has speculated about the existence of other planets, and the possibility of life, beyond our own solar system. The unambiguous detection of the first such extra-solar planets, or 'exoplanets', in the early 1990s has transformed the field into a rapidly expanding and quantitative field of astronomical research. A variety of observational methods have been developed for their discovery and characterisation.</p><p>As of 1 November 2013, just over 1000 exoplanets (in nearly 200 multiple systems) are considered as 'confirmed', many through dedicated space observations (and many more expected from the ongoing Kepler satellite analysis). The architecture of many of the systems (in terms of masses and orbits) are qualitatively different than those that had been expected on the basis of our own solar system. Explaining their properties has led to a substantial advance in understanding their formation, evolution, and internal structure, as well as the formation and evolution of our own solar system.</p><p>The literature accompanying their discovery and characterisation is substantial. Since 1990, some 7000 papers have been published in the refereed literature (and an estimated 3000 or more in conference proceedings), rising from 50-100 per year until 2000, 300-400 until 2005, 500 around 2010, and exceeding more than 1000 per year over the past 2-3 years. These cover discoveries and physical properties (and related instrumental, observational, and data analysis approaches), as well as theoretical, modeling and other interpretative aspects including structure, formation, evolution, composition, and 'habitability'.</p><p>Evidently, given this extensive literature, the following can only represent a selection, chosen to provide some orientation within this multi-disciplinary field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BASIC RESOURCES</head><p>Journals: some 10 journals publish the majority of refereed research papers on exoplanets (with the approximate number published between 1995-2012 given in parentheses): as for other scientific fields, Nature (200) and Science (80) feature some of the more prominent advances, mostly in the observational domain. The other main journals are The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ, 2500), Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (A&amp;A, 1280) Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS, 900), The Astronomical Journal (AJ, 280), Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP, 200), and Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan <ref type="bibr">(PASJ, 200)</ref>.</p><p>Articles connected to solar system aspects also appear in Icarus (220) while those related to astrobiology and habitability also appear in Astrobiology or the International Journal of Astrobiology (200 together).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Historical speculation and first detections</head><p>The reliable detection of the first exoplanets in the 1990s followed centuries of philosophical speculation about the existence of other worlds, various erroneous claims largely based on astrometric measurements made over earlier decades, on studies of the various observational prospects, and on radial velocity measurement programs aimed at characterizing the substellar binary mass distribution. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Physical nature and definition</head><p>As for Pluto's status in our own solar system, the precise definition of an exoplanet is not entirely trivial (and has been the subject of IAU recommendations and resolutions). Considerations involve the object's mass (whether below that of hydrogen/deuterium fusion), its formation mechanism (whether by disk accretion or protostellar gas cloud collapse), and details such as its shape and orbit. Broadly, a planet is considered to be the end product of disk accretion around a primary star or substar. Most discovered to date have masses below about 13 Jupiter masses (above which deuterium nuclear burning occurs).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DETECTION METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Overview</head><p>Direct imaging of exoplanets (the detection of a pointlike image of the planet as a result of reflected star light) is highly challenging. For most of the exoplanets known today direct imaging is beyond current observational limits, due to a combination of the close planet-star proximity, and the intense 'glare' of the host star swamping its reflected light. As a result, a number of other indirect methods have been developed and applied to their discovery and characterisation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p><p>As a planet orbits its host star, both planet and star orbit their common center of mass, leading to a periodic orbital motion of the star itself around the system's center of mass (the barycenter). Three 'dynamical' detection methods exploit this motion (and consequently probe the exoplanet mass): measurement of the star's time-varying radial velocity, its position on the sky (astrometry) and, in a few special cases, timing signatures. Two other detection approaches are of central importance: photometric transits, and gravitational lensing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> classifies these various methods in terms of exoplanet masses detectable, and the numbers discovered to date by each. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates the discoveries over the past 20 years, as a function of exoplanet semi-major axis (ordinate), discovery method (symbol), and mass (symbol size). This diagram underlines a number of key points: (a) radial velocity measurements led the initial discoveries in the early 1990s. They have grown in number, have progressively pushed to lower exoplanet masses, and have continued to dominate numerically at a 0.5 AU; (b) transit measurements were first made around 2000. Various surveys have led to increased detections over the past 10 years, and measurements from space have led to the method dominating at a 0.3 AU; (c) other methods have resulted in smaller numbers of detections to date, but nevertheless probe crucial aspects, and are expected to grow in number and importance as new imaging initiatives on the ground, and astrometric measurements from space, develop over the coming years.</p><p>These specific detection methods are considered in further detail in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Individual methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Radial velocities</head><p>The radial velocity detection method <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3d)</ref> probes the detailed stellar motion as the result of one or more orbiting planets through the spectroscopic Doppler shifts of the star's spectral lines. The effect is present for all stars with orbiting planets unless the orbit is directly 'face on' to us on the sky. For small planetary masses the perturbations are evidently smaller, and for wider orbits the temporal changes occur only over years or decades, both restricting the method's applicability according to <ref type="bibr">1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015</ref> Discovery year  the instrument's accuracy and stability.</p><p>The current state-of-the-art reaches long-term accuracies of around 0.2 ms −1 , sufficient to reach planetary masses of around 1 Earth mass. More than 500 exoplanets in 400 systems have been discovered up to late 2013 (of which some 100 have three or more planets). Around 20 radial velocity instruments across the world have contributed to the discoveries, with HARPS at the ESO 3.6-m telescope <ref type="bibr">(ref. 10)</ref>, and HIRES at the Keck 10-m telescope (ref. 11) dominating both in terms of numbers of discoveries and accuracy.</p><p>Using this method, exoplanets have been discovered around a large variety of stars, including main-sequence stars like the Sun, low-mass M dwarfs, and metal-poor stars (including one of probable extragalactic origin). Exoplanets with unexpected properties have proven to be common. These include very closely orbiting 'hot Jupiters' (which are considered unlikely to have formed in situ), giant planets several times the mass of Jupiter, orbits highly inclined to the host star's rotation axis, and even retrograde orbits. Multi-planet systems have provided a wealth of information on resonant systems, from which constraints on formation and migration processes have been inferred (see sect. VII), as well as on dynamical architectures and orbital stability. Amongst the large number of resonant systems are the first, GJ 876, in which the two planets b and c are locked in a 2:1 mean motion resonance (see also ref. 84), and the first Laplace resonance (three orbiting resonant planets), actually in the same system, in which planets c, b and e orbit in periods of 30.4, 61.1, and 126.6 d (see also ref. 85).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Astrometry</head><p>Astrometric detection <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3e</ref>) exploits the host star's minuscule (side-to-side) positional oscillations on the sky as the result of one or more orbiting planets. The effect exists irrespective of the orbital projection geometry with respect to the observer. Current astrometric instruments are barely able to detect the expected positional motions, just one astrometric exoplanet discovery has been convincingly claimed to date (ref. 18), although observations from space (Hipparcos and Hubble Space Telescope) have made some preliminary advances. The situation will change substantially with ESA's Gaia space astrometry mission (launch due late 2013/early 2014).</p><p>18. "The PHASES differential astrometry data archive.</p><p>V. Candidate substellar companions to binary systems," M.W. Muterspaugh, B.F. Lane, S.R. <ref type="bibr">Kulkarni et al., AJ 140, 1657</ref><ref type="bibr">-1671</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010</ref>. The latest in a long history of claimed astrometric planet detections. All previous claims having been demonstrated to have been false, the authors state that 'these may represent either the first such companions detected, or the latest in the tragic history of this challenging approach.' HD 176051 b currently appears as the only astrometric discovery in exoplanet.eu/catalog. (I) 19.

Astrometry measurements at the sub-milliarcsec level are at the limits of present technology, but nevertheless illustrate the method's importance in establishing the degree of co-planarity of the orbits of multiple exoplanet systems, important for characterizing their formation and evolution. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Timing</head><p>In the timing method for exoplanet detection, any strictly periodic time signature of the host star will be perturbed by an orbiting planet, whose presence is revealed by nonperiodicity. Such phenomena are relatively uncommon, but include radial pulsations, pulsar-type radio emissions, or spectroscopic binary eclipses.</p><p>The first reliable detection of planetary mass objects surrounding other stars were the three objects orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 reported in 1992. Known pulsar planets remain few in number (only one other has been discovered since), orbit stars at the end stages of their evolutionary lifetime, and may have been formed by very different mechanisms to those now known to surround main-sequence stars. The timing method has subsequently been applied to the detection of planets surrounding pulsating and eclipsing binary stars. 24.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Microlensing</head><p>Gravitational lensing, specifically in the domain referred to as microlensing in which distinct images are not resolved, provides an important if somewhat less intuitive method of exoplanet discovery <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3f)</ref>. Under conditions of essentially perfect alignment between a distant background star (providing an arbitrary source of light), an intermediate-distance foreground star with an orbiting planet, and the observer on Earth, the light from the background star is gravitationally 'lensed' according to the prescriptions of general relativity, and significantly amplified both by the foreground star and its orbiting planet. Observers monitor large numbers of stars, and wait for serendipitous alignment conditions eventually brought about by the ever-changing space motions of the background star, foreground star, and Earth-Sun system. By recording the amplified light of the background star over the days or weeks of the evolving alignment, planets can be discovered, and their mass and orbital semi-major axis can be derived.</p><p>28.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Transits</head><p>If the exoplanet orbit around its host star is fortuitously aligned such that its orbit plane is edge-on to our line-of-sight <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3a-c)</ref>, the planet may transit across the stellar disk, analogous to the transits of Mercury and Venus seen from Earth. Then its radius can be measured from the decrease in starlight, and its orbital period from the time between transits.</p><p>This method is of great importance to exoplanet studies since combining the radius of the planet with its mass (from dynamical studies), yields its density and hence (under certain assumptions) first indications of its composition. A number of other more subtle phenomena can be studied through the detailed form of the transit light curve: orbital eccentricity, planet surface gravity, star spots, the alignment of the orbit plane with the stellar rotation axis (via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, ref. 37), planetary oblateness, apsidal precession, transit-timing variations due to other planets, and the possibility of detecting exoplanet satellites and rings.</p><p>Of the dedicated ground-based surveys, HAT (Hungarian Automated Telescope, ref. 38) and WASP (WideAngle Search for Planets, ref. 39) have together discovered some 150 exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars, providing a wealth of physical insights due to the high signal-to-noise follow-up observations possible.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Imaging</head><p>Imaging remains highly challenging because of the relative proximity between star and planet, and the enormous contrast ratio (a factor of 10 8 or more) between the visible light from the star and that reflected from, or emitted by, the planet (the contrast ratio improves moving from the visible to the infrared spectral range). As a result only young, warm and self-luminous giant planets moving in a very wide (long-period) orbits have been detected to date. Specially-designed ground-based instruments (notably VLT-SPHERE and Gemini Planet Imager, ref. 53) are expected to come on line in late-2013 to early-2014 to advance these observations. They are equipped with 'extreme' adaptive optics (to minimize atmospheric scattering of the intense light from the host star) and coronagraphs (to attenuate the light from the star).</p><p>Space missions, notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF, ref. 54) and ESA's Darwin (ref. 55), have been studied over the past decade but are presently in hibernation due to their challenging technologies. Both coronagraphic and free-flying interferometric versions were considered, operating in either the visible or infrared (the choice being influenced by the spectral lines and intended atmospheric diagnostics being emphasized). It should be stressed that 'imaging' of exoplanets implicitly refers to the detection of a point-like image of the planet. Resolved imaging of the planet surface is a substantially more challenging problem, presently considered as 'beyond the state-of-the-art'. As described in ref. 59 'the scientific benefit from this monstrously difficult task does not seem commensurate with the difficulty'. Resolved imaging using 'hypertelescopes' (ref. 60) has also been considered.  <ref type="bibr">118, 517-524 (1996)</ref>. Argues that resolved images of exoplanets are in principle obtainable with ground-based arrays over 10 km baselines. (A)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. HOST STARS</head><p>Many detailed studies of the host stars of exoplanets have been made. These include their distances, luminosities, kinematic and dynamical properties derived from the Hipparcos space astrometry mission, abundance analyses to examine the occurrence of exoplanets as a function of metallicity and thereby probing their formation mechanism <ref type="bibr">(ref. 61)</ref>, and specific studies of lithium and beryllium abundances to examine whether the surface layers of the host star has been 'polluted' by the accretion of planetary matter <ref type="bibr">(ref. 62)</ref>. Studies have examined the radio and X-ray emission properties of host stars with the aim of probing star-planet interactions and magnetospheric emission processes. Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, is being used to give independent constraints on fundamental stellar parameters such as mass, density, radius, age, rotation period, and chemical composition <ref type="bibr">(ref. 63)</ref>.</p><p>The growing number of confirmed planets is leading to improved statistics on the frequency of planetary systems around stars of different types (refs 64-66).</p><p>61.

Results suggest that the presence of planets may increase the amount of mixing and deepen the convective zone such that Li can be burned and therefore depleted. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. BROWN DWARFS AND FREE-FLOATING PLANETS</head><p>A discussion of brown dwarfs must accompany any broad discussion of exoplanets for a number of reasons. Brown dwarfs are formed at the low-mass end of the star formation process, and studies of the environment of brown dwarfs therefore reveals further insight into the formation of disk and planetary systems around normal stars. Thus brown dwarfs are themselves now known to be accompanied by disks and probably their own (lowermass) 'planetary systems'. Understanding the formation and distribution of such brown dwarfs also helps to establish whether low-mass 'free-floating' objects being discovered in star clusters are a byproduct of star formation, or whether they represent planets ejected from their own 'solar system' as a result of dynamical evolutionary processes. An understanding of brown dwarfs also enters into the understanding of planet formation mechanisms within the protostellar disk. See also ref. 8. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. FORMATION AND EVOLUTION</head><p>Treatments of exoplanet formation start with the complexities of star formation (ref. 72), leading from protostars and protostellar collapse to disk formation in young stellar objects and the formation of protoplanetary disks. Within these, a succession of hierarchical processes leads in a 'bottom-up' sequence to the formation of 'terrestrial' mass planets: interstellar dust agglomerating into rocks (typical size ∼ 1 m), thereafter into planetesimals (∼ 10 4 − 10 5 m), protoplanets (∼ 10 6 m), with more chaotic growth thereafter leading to objects of terrestrial planet size (∼ 10 7 m). There remains uncertainty whether the giant planets form by core accretion (rapid accretion of gas onto a massive core formed as for the terrestrial planets), or via gravitational disk instabilities, or some combination of the two. Thereafter, the gas disk from which the planets formed disperses.</p><p>Either through viscous interaction with the residual gas disk, or through gravitational interaction with a residual planetesimal 'sea', the planets so formed may then migrate inwards, or in some cases outwards, depending primarily on the object's mass. A further phase of planet-planet scattering may lead to qualitative changes in the architecture of the resulting system, through ejection of objects from the gravitational control of the host star, through rapid inward migration and perhaps infall onto the parent star, or through a variety of complex gravitational resonances (see also refs. 108-109) such as mean motion, spin-orbit, or Kozai resonances (as observed in our own solar system). Planets moving close-in to the host star are also subject to tidal evolution and tidal heating (ref. 87). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. INTERIORS AND ATMOSPHERES</head><p>A significant advance in the knowledge of exoplanet interiors and atmospheres has been made possible with the discovery of transiting exoplanets. Densities from their masses and radii are providing the first indications of their interior structure and composition, while broadband brightness temperature measurements from transit photometry and spectroscopy are providing the first insights into their atmospheric composition and thermal transport processes. All of this has been substantially facilitated by the knowledge of interiors and irradiated atmospheres of solar system planets and satellites acquired over the last half century.</p><p>Physical models of exoplanets span two extreme classes of object, and potentially much in between: the low-mass high-density 'solid' planets dominated by metallic cores and silicate-rich and/or ice-rich mantles, and the highmass low-density gas giants dominated by their massive accreted H/He envelopes.</p><p>For the gas-rich giants, models of their interiors and models of their atmospheres are closely connected, and the most recent atmospheric models couple their emergent flux with their assembly by core accretion. Models of their interiors predict bulk properties such as the pressure-temperature relation, and their radii as a function of mass. For close-in, highly irradiated gas giants, the additional external heat source has a significant effect on the pressure-temperature structure of the outer atmosphere. Combined with inferences on their probable bulk chemical composition, atmospheric models also predict broad-band colors and spectral features arising from specific atomic and molecular species.</p><p>Interior models of low-mass planets without massive gaseous envelopes aim to determine the mass-radius relation for a given internal composition, and the most likely internal composition given a specific planet's measured mass and radius. For terrestrial-type planets, a somewhat distinct problem is establishing the nature of their atmospheres: whether they might have acquired a gaseous envelope either by impact accretion or by outgassing, their likely composition, and whether such an atmosphere might have been retained or eroded over its evolutionary lifetime. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. HABITABILITY</head><p>Assessment of the suitability of a planet for supporting life is largely based on the knowledge of life on Earth. With the general consensus among biologists that carbon-based life requires water for its self-sustaining chemical reactions, the search for habitable planets has focused on identifying environments in which liquid water is likely to stable over billions of years. Even so, present discovery and characterisation methods yield essentially only the planet's equilibrium surface temperature. More complex atmospheric properties, for example, determine the fact that of the three planets in the Sun's 'habitable zone', only one actually supports liquid surface water.</p><p>The new discipline of astrobiology, the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the Universe, encompasses the search for habitable environments in the solar system and beyond, and for biospheres that might be very different from Earth's. It is a cross-disciplinary effort, with knowledge being assimilated from astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, geology, physics, and planetary science.</p><p>Many other conditions have been hypothesized as necessary for the development of life, largely based on the single life form known in the Universe, namely that on Earth. Hypothetical conditions rapidly become tied to the more philosophical discussions of the anthropic principle, which broadly states that the physical Universe must be compatible with conscious life that observes it.</p><p>The 'search for extra-terrestrial intelligence' (SETI) is motivated by the belief that life, and intelligence, is likely to emerge under conditions resembling those on the early Earth. It is still generally perceived to lie somewhat at the edge of main-stream science -perhaps like the search for exoplanets in the 1980s and early 1990s. star and planet formation, and exoplanet detection, thereafter focusing on the development and search for life, and detailed considerations of the habitable zone.

Although Kepler ceased nominal operations in May 2013, a substantial fraction of sev- eral thousand high-quality photometric candidates are likely to be considered as confirmed planets in due course. The Kepler mission is yielding unprecedented statisti- cal insight into transiting systems (ref. 42), and has discovered (amongst others) many multiple planet sys- tems (frequently displaying orbital resonances), numer- ous 'dynamically-packed' systems including one with six transiting planets (ref. 43), the first circumbinary planet (ref. 44), the first transiting planet smaller than Earth (ref. 45), and the first planet-planet eclipse (ref. 46). Spectroscopy around the time of the 'secondary eclipse' (as the planet moves behind the star, Fig. 3b) can reveal information about the planet's atmosphere, providing in- sight into its chemical composition, temperature, albedo, temperature inversions, and atmospheric circulation.</figDesc></figure>
