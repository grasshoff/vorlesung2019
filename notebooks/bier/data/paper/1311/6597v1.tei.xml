				<p>Context. Semi-grey atmospheric models (with one opacity for the visible and one opacity for the infrared) are useful to understand the global structure of irradiated atmospheres, their dynamics and the interior structure and evolution of planets, brown dwarfs and stars. But when compared to direct numerical radiative transfer calculations for irradiated exoplanets, these models systematically overestimate the temperatures at low optical depth, independently of the opacity parameters. Aims. We wish to understand why semi-grey models fail at low optical depths, and provide a more accurate approximation to the atmospheric structure by accounting for the variable opacity in the infrared. Methods. Using the Eddington approximation to link the energy of the beam to its radiation pressure, we derive an analytical model to account for lines and/or bands in the infrared. Four parameters (instead of two for the semi-grey models) are used: a visible opacity κ v , two infrared opacities, κ 1 and κ 2 , and β the fraction of the energy in the beam with opacities κ 1. We consider that the atmosphere receives an incident irradiation in the visible with an effective temperature T irr and at an angle µ * , and that it is heated from below with an effective temperature T int. Results. Our irradiated non-grey model is found to provide a range of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical calculations. We find that because of the variable opacities in the infrared, a smaller fraction of the source function is contributing to the heating of the upper layers leading to smaller temperatures than in the semi-grey models. For small values of β (expected when lines are dominant), we find that the non-grey effects are confined to low-optical depths. However, for β ∼ &gt; 1/2 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence smaller or comparable with the width of the Planck function), we find that the temperature structure is affected even down to infrared optical depths unity and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing effect. Conclusions. The expressions that we derive may be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative transfer models and improve their convergence.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The discovery of numerous star-planet systems and the possibility to characterize the planets' atmospheric properties has led to a great many publications using radiative transfer calculations, often "off-the-shelf" from numerical models. Given the a priori infinite amount of possible compositions for mostly unknown exoplanetary atmospheres, it is highly valuable to have the possibility to perform very fast calculations and also understand what determines the thermal structure of an irradiated atmosphere.</p><p>Analytical radiative transfer solutions for atmospheres have been calculated with a variety of assumptions and different contexts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eddington 1916;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar 1935</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chandrasekhar , 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">King 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Matsui &amp; Abe 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Weaver &amp; Ramanathan 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pujol &amp; North 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chevallier et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shaviv et al. 2011</ref>, among others). However, the discovery of super-Earths, giant exoplanets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars close to a source of intense radiation has prompted the need for solutions that account for both an outside and an inside radiation field, and properly link low and high optical depths levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hubeny et al. (2003)</ref>,</p><p>Send offprint requests to: V.Parmentier <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rutily et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hansen (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guillot (2010)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Robinson &amp; Catling (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Heng et al. (2012)</ref> provided such solutions in the framework of a semi-grey model, with one opacity for the incoming irradiation (generally mostly at visible wavelengths), and one opacity for the thermal radiation field (generally mostly at infrared wavelengths). These approximations have been used in hydrodynamical models of planetary atmospheres (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Heng et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2013)</ref>, planetary evolution models (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Miller-Ricci &amp; Fortney 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Guillot &amp; Havel 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Budaj et al. 2012</ref>), planet synthesis models ( <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. 2012a,b)</ref>, and a variety of other applications. They prompted <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager (2009)</ref> to derive an inversion method aimed at finding all possible thermal and compositional atmospheric structures in agreement with available spectroscopic data.</p><p>However, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for an atmosphere irradiated from above with a flux σT 4 irr and heated from below with a flux σT <ref type="bibr">4</ref> int , while semi-grey models provide solutions that are wellbehaved when compared to full numerical solution at optical depths larger than about unity, the temperatures at low-optical depth appear to be systematically hotter than in the numerical so-  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2010)</ref> for values of the greenhouse factor γ −1 v ranging from 0.01 to 100 (black to red lines). Small values of γ v are redder. We used µ * = 1/ √ 3, T irr = 1250 K corresponding to the dayside average profile of a planet at 0.05AU from a sun-like star, and accounting for the albedo obtained in the numerical model. The internal temperature is T int = 125K and gravity 25 ms −2 . The effective temperature of the studied slice of atmosphere 1 is defined by T 4 eff, µ * = T 4 int + µ * T 4 irr . For the numerical solution, the relation between pressure and optical depth was calculated using Rosseland mean opacities and TiO and VO opacities were not included.</p><p>lutions. Most severely, this occurs regardless of the choice of the two parameters of the problem, i.e. the thermal (infrared) opacity κ th and the ratio of the visible to infrared opacity γ v ≡ κ v /κ th . For hot Jupiters, as in the example of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, the real temperature profiles at low optical depths can be several hundreds of Kelvins cooler than predicted by the semi-grey solutions.</p><p>The levels probed both by transit spectroscopy and by the observations of secondary eclipses of exoplanets often correspond to low-optical depths levels (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Showman et al. 2009</ref>), i.e.where semi-grey models seem to systematically overestimate the temperatures. Furthermore, the fact that the problem persists regardless of the main parameters implies that the functional form of the semigrey solutions is probably not appropriate for inversion models. Non-grey effects are known to facilitate the cooling of the upper atmosphere (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pierrehumbert (2010)</ref> for a qualitative explanation). Obviously they must be included. This is the purpose of the present paper.</p><p>We hereafter first describe previous analytical methods used to solve the radiative transfer problem analytically. In Section 3, we then derive an analytical non-grey line model, and apply it to the structure of irradiated giant planets in Section 4. We note at this point that while we focus the discussion on exoplanets, we believe that this model is applicable to a much wider variety of problems, as long as an atmosphere is irradiated both from above and below. Out method could also be used to solve the radiative transfer equations in other geometries, such as the problem of the protoplanetary disk thermal structure. We provide our conclusions in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">The equation of radiative transfer</head><p>Following Guillot (2010), we will consider the problem of a plane-parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium which receives from above a collimated flux σT <ref type="bibr">4</ref> irr at an angle θ * = cos −1 (µ * ) from the vertical, and from below an isotropic flux σT 4 int . The total energy budget of the modeled atmosphere is then set by T 4 eff, µ * = T 4 int + µ * T 4 irr , which define the effective temperature in this paper <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .The irradiation and intrinsic fluxes are generally characterized by very different wavelengths. Although this is not required in the solution that we propose, it is convenient to think of them as being emitted preferentially the visible and in the infrared, respectively. We will neglect scattering because it complexifies the problem dramatically and because to first order, the solution with scattering is close to the one obtained when the irradiation flux is reduced by a factor (1 − A), where A is the Bond albedo. We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Heng et al. (2012)</ref> provide an elegant solution to include scattering in analytical radiative transfer solutions within the two-stream approximation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Meador &amp; Weaver (1980)</ref> for a review of the different two stream methods including scattering). We defer including this effect to a future work.</p><p>In order to solve the radiative transfer problem for a plane parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, one has to solve the following equation for all frequency ν and all directions µ (Chandrasekhar 1960):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">− µ dI µν dm = κ ν I νµ − κ ν B ν (T )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I µν is the specific intensity at the wavelength ν propagating with an angle θ = cos −1 (µ) with the vertical, κ ν is the opacity at a given wavelength and B ν is the Planck function and dm = ρdz is the mass increment along the path of the radiation.</p><p>(As usual, T , ρ and z are the atmospheric temperature, density and height, respectively.) The main difficulty in solving eq. (1) lies in its triple dependence on µ, ν and T and additional dependence on m. An analytical solution requires simplifications in terms both of the opacities used and/or dependence of the radiation intensity with angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Opacities and optical depth</head><p>The need for simplification implies that means of the opacities must be used. The first one by importance is the Rosseland mean, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 κ R ≡ ∞ 0 ∂B ν ∂T dν −1 ∞ 0 1 κ ν ∂B ν ∂T dν (2)</formula><p>It can be demonstrated that when at all wavelengths the mean free path of photons is small compared to the scale height of the <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We note that in stellar physics the effective temperature is usually what we call the internal temperature. In both planetary and stellar fields, the effective temperature aim at representing the total energy budget of the atmosphere. Whereas in stellar physics most of the flux comes from the deep interior, this is no more true in irradiated atmospheres and T 4 eff, µ * = T 4 int + µ * T 4 irr is a better representation of the total energy budget of the studied slice of atmosphere. The energy budget of the whole atmosphere is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T 4 eff = T 4 int + T 4 irr /4.</formula><p>atmosphere, the radiative gradient obeys its well-defined diffusion limit and (unless convection sets in) the temperature profiles becomes that obtained from a grey atmosphere in which the opacity is set to the Rosseland mean <ref type="bibr">(Mihalas &amp; Mihalas 1984, p. 350)</ref>. We hence define the optical depth τ on the basis of the Rosseland mean opacity, such that, along the vertical direction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">dτ ≡ κ R dm (3)</formula><p>Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the relation between pressure and optical depth can be found by integrating equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_108">(3)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">τ(P) = P 0 κ R (P , T (P )) g dP (4)</formula><p>The optical depth thus becomes the natural variable to account for the dependence with depth in the radiative transfer problem. For any strictly positive Rosseland mean opacities, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_108">(4)</ref> is a bijection relating pressure and optical depth. Thus, any solution of the radiative transfer equations in terms of optical depth can be converted to a solution in term of pressure for any functional form of the Rosseland mean opacities. The second mean of the opacity that is traditionally used for radiative transfer is the so-called Planck mean:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">κ P ≡ ∞ 0 B ν dν −1 ∞ 0 κ ν B ν dν (5)</formula><p>We use it to quantify the "non-greyness" of the atmosphere through the ratio between the Planck and Rosseland means:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">γ P ≡ κ P κ R (6)</formula><p>While the value of the Rosseland mean opacity is dominated by the smallest values of the opacity function κ ν , the Planck mean opacity is dominated by its highest values. Thus, it can be shown that γ P = 1 for a grey atmosphere and γ P &gt; 1 for a non-grey atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(King 1956</ref>).</p><p>In irradiated atmospheres, a collimated flux coming from the star is absorbed at different atmospheric levels. We name κ v the opacity relevant to the absorption of the stellar flux. As will be shown in Sec. 3.8, the absorption of the visible flux appear linearly in the radiative transfer equations. Thus a solution can be found using multiple visible opacity bands κ v1 , κ v2 , etc.</p><p>We further define the ratio of the visible opacity to the mean (Rosseland) thermal opacity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">γ v ≡ κ v /κ R .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In order to solve the radiative transfer problem analytically, we suppose that γ v is constant with optical depth. Once γ v is chosen, we can solve the equations for the visible radiation independently from the final thermal structure of the atmosphere. Of course, purely grey models are such that γ v = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">The picket-fence model</head><p>It is important to note at this point that two set of opacities with different wavelength-dependence may have the same Rosseland and Planck means. We must constrain the problem further, and to this intent, we now consider the simplest possible line model, known as the picket-fence model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mihalas 1978)</ref>, where the thermal opacities can take two different values κ 1 and κ 2 (see <ref type="figure">Fig.2</ref>) such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">κ ν =        κ 1 for ν ∈ [n∆ν, n∆ν + δν[ κ 2 for ν ∈ [n∆ν + δν, (n + 1)∆ν[ n ∈ [1, N] (8) κ 2 κ 1 n∆υ (n+1)∆υ (n+2)∆υ (n+3)∆υ Opacity (κ υ )</formula><p>Frequency (υ) δυ <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">The grey case</head><p>An approximate method to solve eq. (1) including the angular dependency has been developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chandrasekhar (1960)</ref> in the case of a non-irradiated atmosphere (T irr = 0). The idea is to replace the integrals over angle in eq. (1) by a gaussian sum over µ. It can then be solved to an arbitrary precision by increasing the number of terms in the sum. The boundary condition at the top of the atmosphere is simply given as I µ&lt;0 (0) = 0. The expansion to the fourth term yields the following temperature profile:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">T (τ) 4 = 3T 4 int 4 τ + Q + L 1 e −k 1 τ + L 2 e −k 2 τ + L 3 e −k 3 τ<label>(16)</label></formula><p>with Q = 0.706920,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">L 1 = −0.083921, L 2 = −0.036187, L 3 = −0.009461, k 1 = 1.</formula><p>103188, k 2 = 1.591778 and k 3 = 4.45808 (Chandrasekhar 1960, table VIII) 2 . One of the strong results from this formalism is that the skin temperature of the planet, the temperature at zero optical depth, is independent of the order of expansion and therefore corresponds to the exact value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">T 4 skin = √ 3 T 4 int 4 (17)</formula><p>This expression is exact only in the limit of a grey, non-irradiated atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">The non-grey case</head><p>Chandrasekhar (1960) further developed a perturbation method in order to include non-grey thermal opacities. This method was improved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Krook (1963)</ref>. However, these perturbation methods either work for small departure from the grey opacities or involve a fastidious iterative procedure (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Unno &amp; Yamashita 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Avrett &amp; Krook 1963</ref>) and are no longer fully analytical. However, considering that the variations in the opacities are short compared to the variations of the Planck function, analytical solutions can be found for an arbitrary large departure from the grey opacities. Noting the similar role of µ and κ ν in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">King (1956)</ref>, following <ref type="bibr">Münch (1946)</ref> used the method of discrete ordinates in order to turn the integrals over frequency into gaussian sums. For the picket-fence model defined in Section 2.1.3 and the second approximation for the angular dependency, King's method leads to the following temperature profile:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">T 4 (τ) = 3 4 T 4 int        1 3γ P + τ + ( √ γ P − γ 1 )( √ γ P − γ 2 ) γ 1 γ 2 3γ P (e −τ/τ lim − 1)        (18)</formula><p>As in the grey case, the method of discrete ordinates leads to an exact relation for the skin temperature, whatever the dependency of κ ν with frequency (but no dependence in pressure or temperature):</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">T 4 skin = 3 γ P T 4 int 4<label>(19)</label></formula><p>In the grey limit, γ P = 1 and we recover eq. (17). Otherwise, γ P &gt; 1, implying that for a non-irradiated atmosphere, non-grey effects will always tend to lower the atmospheric skin temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Moment equation method</head><p>2.3.1. Equations for the momentum of the radiation intensity A simpler way to solve the radiative transfer equation has been carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eddington (1916)</ref>. The idea is to solve the equation using the different momentum of the intensity defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">(J ν , H ν , K ν ) = 1 −1 I µν (1, µ, µ 2 ) dµ<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Then, integrating over ν and µ eq. (1) and µ times eq. (1) one gets the momentum equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">dH ν dτ ν = J ν − B ν (T ) (21) dK ν dτ ν = H ν<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Assuming the atmosphere to be in radiative equilibrium, we can write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">∞ 0 (κ ν J ν − κ ν B ν ) dν = 0 (23)</formula><p>For a grey atmosphere (κ ν = κ R ∀ν), eqs. (21-23) can be integrated over frequency, leading to an equation on J, H, K and B, the frequency-integrated version of J ν , H ν , K ν and B ν . The radiative equilibrium equation becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">J = B<label>(24)</label></formula><p>Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21-23)</ref> are then a set of three equations with four unknowns. The system is not closed because by integrating eq. (1) over all angles we have lost the information on the angular dependency of the irradiation. A closure relationship that contains angular dependency of the radiation field is therefore needed. A common closure relationship, known as the Eddington approximation is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">J = 3K (25)</formula><p>This relationship is exact in two very different cases: when the radiation field is isotropic (I µ independent of µ) and in the twostream approximation (I µ&gt;0 = I + 0 and I µ&lt;0 = I − 0 ) Although this seems a very restrictive approximation, it is relevant for the deep layers of the atmosphere due to the quasi-isotropy of the radiation field there. It is also good for the top of the atmosphere, where the flux comes mainly from the τ ≈ 1 layer. Indeed, the exact solution gives a ratio J/K that differs by no more than 20% from the 1/3 ratio over the whole atmosphere and leads to a temperature profile which is correct to 4% in the grey case (see the plain blue line of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> hereafter).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Top boundary condition</head><p>Although in the method of discrete ordinates the boundary condition at the top of the atmosphere is intuitive, in the momentum equations method it is less obvious and different choices has been made by different authors. Usually, the expression for J is known and some integration constant needs to be found. Two equations are needed, one for J(0) and one for H(0). Four possibilities are widely used in the literature from which one has to choose two: </p><formula xml:id="formula_24">H(0) = 1 2 ∞ 0 B (τ) E 2 (τ) dτ</formula><p>For grey and semi-grey models, the first condition is natural. Therefore it is used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hansen (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guillot (2010)</ref>. In the case of a non-grey model, the first condition cannot be implemented (at least directly) because it is a constraint on the total thermal flux but it provides no information on how the thermal flux is split between the opacity bands that are considered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar (1935)</ref> therefore uses for his non-grey, nonirradiated model conditions 2 and 3 in each of the opacity band. He further notes that using condition 4 instead of condition 3 should yield better results, but leads to more complex expressions. In this work, because an accurate treatment of the flux is needed for the non-grey irradiated model, we will use conditions 2 and 4 in each of the opacity band. All these models are discussed in the next sections and summarized in table 2.3.5.</p></div>

He assumes that the relation H(0) = 1 f H J(0) with f H = 1/2, valid in the grey case under the Eddington approximation [see eq. (27)], holds for the two thermal channels separately.

As for the grey case, using f H = 1/ √ 3 would lead to the exact solution for the skin temperature, but at the expense of the accuracy of the profile at deeper levels. Again, we note that, in the non-irradiated case, the temperature at the top of the atmosphere is determined by a single parameter, γ P , representing the "non-greyness" of the atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Irradiated semi-grey model</head><p>In the case of irradiated atmospheres, the presence of an incoming collimated flux at the top of the atmosphere breaks the angular symmetry of the equations. The radiative transfer problem thus cannot be solved analytically (at least not in a simple way) through the discrete ordinates technique any longer. The momentum method is thus required.</p><p>In order to solve the problem, the radiation field is split into two parts: The incoming, collimated radiation field on one hand, the thermal radiation field on the other. The radiative equilibrium equation (eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_108">(23)</ref>) links the two streams as can be seen in Section 3.1 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hansen 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guillot 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Robinson &amp; Catling 2012)</ref>. As mentioned previously in Section 2.1.2, when the incident radiation is at much shorter wavelength than the thermal emission of the atmosphere, the two streams correspond to different characteristic wavelengths and may often be labelled as "visible" and "infrared". This not a requirement however: the solutions apply if the radiation field correspond to other wavelengths or if they overlap.</p><p>As discussed previously (Section 2.3.2), the boundary condition at the top of the model can be chosen in several ways. When using condition 2, Guillot (2010) lets the value of f H be either 1/2 or 1/ √ 3, based on the values obtained in the non-irradiated case. f H = 1/2 is the value that arises from the calculation of the angle dependence between H(0) and J(0) in the isotropic case,</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">but f H = 1/ √</formula><p>3 provides a skin temperature that agrees with the exact value. The two solutions differ by ≈ 3% at most (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), and choosing one over another is not crucial. In any case, for an easier comparison, we provide here the solution of Guillot (2010) for f H = 1/2:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">T 4 = 3T 4 int 4 2 3 + τ + 3T 4 irr 4 µ * 2 3 + µ * γ v + γ v 3µ * − µ * γ v e −γ v τ/µ * .<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where µ * is the cosine of the angle of the incident radiation.

In fact, similarly to the skin temperature, the minimum temperature of a semi-grey atmosphere, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>, depends only on the values of T eff, µ * and γ v . It is lowest and equal to T eff, µ * /2 1/4 both in the γ v → 0 and γ v → ∞ limits. This lower bound for the semi-grey temperature profile is hotter than what the one obtained by numerical calculations taking into account the full set of opacities. The discrepancy is much larger than the variations resulting from the approximation of the momentum method. Clearly, non-grey effects must be invoked to explain the low temperatures obtained by numerical models at low optical depths. Non-grey thermal opacities</p><p>Top boundary condition Expression 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Equations</head><p>We now derive the equations for an irradiated atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium with infrared line opacities as described in sec. 2.1.2. Thus, our model contains three different opacities: κ 1 and κ 2 for the thermal radiation and κ v relevant for the incoming radiation of the star. As explained before, the difference between the thermal and the visible channel is based on the angular dependency of the radiation and not on the frequency. Although the method of discrete ordinates is shown to lead to more exact results, it is complex to adapt to the irradiated case. Therefore, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar (1935)</ref> and Guillot (2010), we solve the radiative transfer equations using the momentum equations.

As seen in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, in the semi-grey limit, and when calculating the full temperature profile, our model differs by at most 2% from the Guillot (2010) model. The difference between the various solutions must be attributed to the Eddington approximation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Using the model</head><p>The temperature vs. optical depth profile for our irradiated picket-fence model is given by eq. (76). The profile has been derived using the Rosseland optical depth as vertical coordinate. It is therefore valid for any functional form of the Rosseland opacities. Equation (4) allows to switch from τ to P as the vertical coordinate. Although, for convenience, this expression contains 4 different variables, γ 1 , γ 2 , γ P , τ lim , it must be kept in mind that, besides the Rosseland mean opacity, there are only two independent variables in the problem. The variables β and R ≡ γ 1 /γ 2 = κ 1 /κ 2 are the ones to consider to have a control on the opacity function used. The variables γ P and τ lim are the ones to consider to have a control on the profile itself. γ P is directly related to the skin temperature of the planet (see section 4.3) whereas τ lim is the optical depth at which the irradiated picketfence model differs from the semi-grey model.

About averaging Equation (76) can thus be considered as depending on κ R , γ P ≡ κ P /κ R and β. While κ R can be considered as a function of pressure and temperature (e.g. extracted from a known Rosseland opacity table) when deriving the atmospheric temperature profile, it is important to realize that the analytical solution remains valid only if γ P and β are held constant. This analytical solution therefore cannot accomodate consistent Rosseland and Planck opacities as a function of depth (a solution consisting of atmospheric slices with different values of γ P is derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar (1935)</ref> for the non-irradiated case but becomes too complex to be handled easily). Furthermore, the solution is provided only for one fixed direction of the incoming irradiation. When considering the case of a non-resolved planet around a star, any information acquired on its atmosphere will have been averaged over at least a fraction of its surface. Solving this problem for the particular case of eq. (76) goes beyond the scope of the present work, but it can be approximated relatively well on the basis of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Guillot (2010)</ref>. This work shows that given an irradiation flux at the substellar point σT 4 sub ≡ σ(R * /D) 2 T 4 * , where T * is the star's effective temperature, R * its radius and D the star-planet distance, the average temperature profile of the planet will be very close to that obtained from the 1-dimensional solution with an average angle µ * = 1/ √ 3 and an average irradiation effective temperature</p><formula xml:id="formula_89">T irr = (1 − A) 1/4 f 1/4 T sub ,</formula><p>where A is the (assumed) Bond albedo of the atmosphere and f is a correction factor, equal to 1/4 when averaging on the entire surface of the planet and equal to 1/2 when averaging on the day-side only.

The difference of these with the exact solution from <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">King (1955)</ref> can be attributed to the Eddington approximation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Comparison of irradiated solutions</head><p>The solutions presented in this work for the irradiated case in the semi-grey case (i.e. R ≡ κ 1 /κ 2 = 1) are very similar to those of Guillot (2010). As seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Comparison between our model in the semi-grey limit and Guillot <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref>. We used γ v = 0.25 (plain line) and γ v = 10 (dashed line). For the Guillot (2010) model we show the curves for two different boundary conditions: f H = 1/2 (blue) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">f H = 1/ √ 3 (green). We used µ * = 1/ √ 3.</formula><p>with those of this work. These differences are of the same kind as those arising from the use of the Eddington approximation compared to exact solutions discussed previously. They are inherent to the approximation made on the angle dependence of the radiation field and implicitly linked to the choice of the different boundary solutions discussed in Section 2.3.2.  As discussed previously, the skin temperature (temperature at the limit of zero optical depth) is an important outcome of radiative transfer and in the case of non-irradiated models, an exact solution is available. We compare our results to analytical results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>. In the limit of a non-irradiated planet and in the limit γ * v → 0, our skin temperature converges to the one derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar (1935)</ref>. This is an important test for the model, as for small values of γ v , most of the stellar flux is absorbed in the deep layers of the planet and the model is expected to behave as a non-irradiated model with the same effective temperature. Moreover, we note that for small values of γ v , the skin temperature is affected only by γ P as was already claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">King (1956)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chandrasekhar (1935)</ref>. This conclusion no longer applies for larger values of γ v for which the skin temperatures then also depend on β. This can be seen by comparing the dotted lines and plain lines of the same color in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 6</ref>. At a given value of γ P , a larger value of β corresponds to a smaller κ 2 /κ 1 . Depending of the value of β, the stellar irradiation can be absorbed in a region which can be optically thick to the two thermal bands, only one, or none, leading to a different behavior for the skin temperature.</p></div>

To overcome the apparent complexity of our solution, we first derive an approximate expression for the thermal fluxes at the top of the atmosphere.

Comparing these expressions with their semi-grey equivalent, we get physical insights on the processes that shape the temperature profile.</p></div>

(76) the contribution to the final temperature of the internal luminosity and of the external irradiation are independent. Thus, the thermal fluxes can be split in two independent contributions that can be studied separatly: <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows which thermal band actually carries the thermal flux H irr out of the atmosphere. This depends strongly whether the stellar irradiation is absorbed in the upper or in the deep atmosphere.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">The skin temperature</head><p>The skin temperature reveals the behavior of the atmosphere at low optical depths. This is the part of the atmosphere probed during the transit of an exoplanet in front of its host star and is therefore of particular importance to interpret the observations. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows that in the irradiated case non-grey effects always tend to lower the skin temperature compared to the semi-grey case. This upper atmospheric cooling is already significant (&gt; 10%) for slightly non-grey opacities (i.e. γ P ≈ 2). For larger values of γ P the cooling is stronger, reaching 50% for γ P ≈ 10 − 1000. Conversely to the non-irradiated case, the skin temperature is not only a function of γ P but also depends on β, i.e. not only the mean opacities are relevant but also their actual shape. For large values of β, when the stellar irradiation is absorbed in the upper layers of the atmosphere (e.g. γ v = 100) the cooling is more efficient than when the stellar irradiation is absorbed in the deep layers (e.g. γ v = 0.01) whereas for small values of β the cooling is independent on γ v . The skin temperature results directly from the radiative equilibrium of the upper atmosphere. Using the boundary condition (49) in the radiative equlibrium equation (23) evaluated at τ = 0 we can write:</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">2γ 1 H 1 (0) + 2γ 2 H 2 (0) − γ * v H v (0) = γ P B(0)<label>(103)</label></formula><p>where the skin temperature is given by T 4 skin = πB(0)/σ.

Thus eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(112)</ref> remains valid.</p><p>However, conversely to the case γ * v τ lim &lt; 1, the top boundary condition now reads :</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">H 1 (0) ≈ −H v (0) + H 2, int H 2 (0) ≈ H ∞ + H 2, irr<label>(116)</label></formula><p>Where H 2, irr is given by eq. (101b) and H 1, int by eq. (102). This leads to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">C 1 = 2 γ 2 1 − β √ γ P (H ∞ − H v (0)) − 2 γ 2 γ * v τ lim H v (0) − 3 γ v H v (0) (117)</formula><p>Again, for large values of γ P , γ 2 → 1−β and replacing the fluxes by their equivalent temperatures we get an expression for T deep valid for γ * v τ lim &gt; 1 and γ P &gt; 2</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">T 4 deep = 2 1 − β T 4 int 4 + 2 √ γ P µ * T 4 irr 4 + 3 γ v + 2 1 − β 1 γ * v τ lim µ * T 4 irr 4 (118) When γ * v τ lim &gt;&gt; 1</formula><p>, the contribution to the deep temperature of the irradiation temperature becomes inversely proportional to √ γ P . As γ P &gt; 1, the deep temperature is smaller in the non-grey case than in the semi-grey case. This is illustrated by the cases γ v = 10 and γ v = 100 of <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. When γ * v τ lim → 1, the term in 1/ √ γ P becomes very small compared to the term in 1/(1 − β) and the expression converges toward equation eq. (115), valid for γ * v τ lim &lt; 1.</p><p>Physical interpretation. When γ * v τ lim &gt;&gt; 1, the incident irradiation is absorbed in the upper atmosphere, where only the channel of highest opacity is optically thick. Thus, the channel of highest opacity κ 1 transports all the energy and radiates it directly to space. The incident irradiation is not transported to the deep atmosphere, leading to a cooler deep atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Outgoing flux</head><p>During secondary eclipse observations, the flux emitted by the planet can be observed in different bands (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Seager &amp; Deming 2010)</ref>. The detection of molecular species in the emission spectrum of an exoplanet depends strongly on the flux contrast between the continuum and the molecular band considered which depends itself on the temperature profile. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the flux per wavelength emitted in the first band (F ν 1 = 4πH 1 (0)/β) over the flux per wavelength emitted in the second band (F ν 2 = 4πH 2 (0)/(1 − β)). This would be the expected contrast in the emission spectrum of the planet between the spectral features and the continuum. For a non-irradiated atmosphere and for small values of γ v this is a monotonic function of the opacity ratio κ 1 /κ 2 . The flux in the band of lowest opacity is always bigger than the flux in the band of highest opacity i.e. we see absorption bands. For large values of γ v , whenever a strong inversion  happens, the absorption bands turn into emission bands. In any case, for large values of κ 1 /κ 2 we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">F ν 2 F ν 1 ∝ κ 1 κ 2 1/2 (119)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Resulting temperature profiles</head><p>No matter how strong the non-greyness of the opacities is, there is always a region, at high enough optical depth, where the nongrey solution converges toward the grey solution (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> in the non-irradiated case). The transition between a regime where the grey model is accurate to a regime where the non-grey effects are of primordial importance is set by the parameter τ lim . For optical depths lower than τ lim , non-grey effects are always important, whereas for optical depth higher than τ lim , non-grey effects are present only if γ v τ lim &lt; 1 and β → 1. Three distinct situations can be observed on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>. For narrow lines (β &lt; 0.1), τ lim is always smaller than one, for larger lines (0.1 &lt; β &lt; 0.9), τ lim is close to one whereas for inverted lines (0.9 &lt; β &lt; 1), τ lim can reach much bigger values. Thus, when γ v &gt;&gt; 1, few nongrey effects are expected in the deep atmosphere, contrary to the cases γ v ≈ 1 and γ v &lt;&lt; 1. In the case of narrow lines (β &lt; 0.1), only the non-grey cooling of the upper atmosphere is effective. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>, the profile remains close to the semi-grey model at large optical depth. However at low optical depth, for τ &lt; τ lim , the atmosphere can be much cooler than in the semi-grey case (case R = 1). In particular, in the γ v = 10 case, the non-grey cooling localize the temperature inversion to a specific layer, contrary to the semi-grey case where it extends to the top of the atmosphere. The envelope of all the profiles (shaded area) is much wider than in the semi-grey case (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref>).</p><p>In the case of large lines or molecular bands (0.1 &lt; β &lt; 0.9) shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref>, both the non-grey cooling of the upper atmosphere and the blanketing effect are important. Whereas the upper atmosphere undergoes an efficient cooling, the lower atmosphere (τ &gt; 1) can experience a significant warming via the blanketing effect. Lowering the ability of the deep atmosphere to cool down efficiently can affect significantly the evolution of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Parmentier &amp; Guillot 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Budaj et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rauscher &amp; Showman 2013</ref>) and could contribute to the radius anomaly of hot-Jupiters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Guillot &amp; Showman 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Laughlin et al. 2011</ref>). Whenever γ v τ lim ≈ 1 the stellar irradiation is deposited at a level where non-grey effects lower the ability of the atmosphere to cool down efficiently. This leads to an efficient and localized warming causing a temperature inversion in the profile at τ ≈ 1/γ * v , even when none is expected from the semi-grey model (i.e. even when γ * v &lt; 1). This happens, for example, when β ≈ 0.5 for γ v = 10, when β ≈ 0.9 for γ v = 1 and for β ≈ 0.99 for γ v = 0.1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14)</ref>.</p><p>In the case of inverted lines, (β &gt; 0.9), shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref>, both the upper temperature and the deep temperature are affected by the non-grey effects. The upper atmosphere cools significantly compared to the semi-grey case. The deep atmosphere can either warm up due to the blanketing effect but, for large values of γ v it becomes cooler than in the semi-grey case (see the case γ v = 10 and R = 100 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14)</ref>. Temperatures as cool as 0.5T eff, µ * can be reached. This is fundamentally different from the semi-grey case where the deep temperature is always larger than 2 1/4 T eff, µ * (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>).</p><p>As β increases, τ lim increases and the blanketing effect disappear. Eventually, when β → 1, the opacities, and thus the profile, become semi-grey again.</p><p>In any case, our irradiated picket-fence model can reach the whole temperature range span by the numerical models (see the shaded area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 12 to 14)</ref>. Our model should therefore be preferred to classical semi-grey models as an approximate solution for the temperature profile of irradiated atmospheres. .

It is parametrized by γ v , the ratio of the visible to the infrared Rosseland mean opacities, γ P the ratio of the Planck to the Rosseland mean thermal opacities and β, the width of the lines. The model is valid for any functional form of the Rosseland mean opacities, the ones obtained from an opacity table for example. However, it cannot account for both realistic Rosseland mean and Planck mean opacities. Their ratio, γ P and the width of the lines, β, must be held constant through the at-mosphere. Although the model is limited to two thermal opacity bands, it can take into account any number of visible opacity bands, each band adding two new parameters, the strength of the band γ vi and its width β vi .</p><p>Our model solves the inability of previous analytical models to reach temperatures as cold as predicted by the numerical calculations. For opacities dominated by strong and narrow lines (β &lt; 0.1), non-grey opacities lead to a colder upper atmosphere but converge toward the grey model at optical depth greater than τ lim . For opacities dominated by wide lines, or "bands" (β ≈ 0.5), non-grey opacities still allow the upper atmosphere to cool down more efficiently but also inhibit the cooling of the lower atmosphere. In that case, a significant warming of the lower atmosphere can happen, down to optical depth much greater than τ lim . This planetary blanketing effect could contribute to the radius anomaly of hot-Jupiters.</p><p>Temperature inversions that were not predicted by previous analytical models occur whenever γ v τ lim ≈ 1 due to the interaction between the incoming stellar irradiation and the non-grey thermal opacities. These could have interesting observational consequences.</p><p>Finally, our model allows for a much greater range of temperature profiles than other solutions of the radiative transfer equations for irradiated atmospheres. We encourage the community to use it when fast calculations of atmospheric temperature profiles are needed.
