			<abstract>
				<p>Any gravitating mass traversing a relatively sparse gas experiences a retarding force created by its disturbance of the surrounding medium. In a previous contribution (Lee &amp; Stahler 2011), we determined this dynamical friction force when the object&apos;s velocity was subsonic. We now extend our analysis to the supersonic regime. As before, we consider small perturbations created in the gas far from the gravitating object, and thereby obtain the net influx of linear momentum over a large, bounding surface. Various terms in the perturbation series formally diverge, necessitating an approximate treatment of the flow streamlines. Nevertheless, we are able to derive exactly the force itself. As in the subsonic case, we find that F = ˙ M V , where ˙ M is the rate of mass accretion onto the object and V its instantaneous velocity with respect to distant background gas. Our force law holds even when the object is porous (e.g., a galaxy) or is actually expelling mass in a wind. Quantitatively, the force in the supersonic regime is less than that derived analytically by previous researchers, and is also less than was found in numerical simulations through the mid 1990s. We urge simulators to revisit the problem using modern numerical techniques. Assuming our result to be correct, it is applicable to many fields of astrophysics, ranging from exoplanet studies to galactic dynamics.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Whenever a massive object passes through a rarefied medium, it draws surrounding matter toward it. As a result, this material creates an overdense wake behind the object that exerts its own gravitational pull, retarding the original motion. Such dynamical friction arises whether the medium consists of non-interacting point particles, e.g., a stellar cluster, or a continuum fluid, e.g., an interstellar cloud. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chandrasekhar (1943)</ref> provided the essential theory when the background is collisionless, and his solution has been extensively used in studies of both star clusters and galaxies. Interaction of a gravitating object with gas also occurs in a wide variety of situations. A partial list of topics and references includes: the interaction of planets and gaseous disks <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Teyssandier, Terquem, &amp; Papaloizou 2013)</ref>; the orbital decay of common-envelope binaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ricker &amp; Taam 2008)</ref>; the settling of massive stars in dense molecular clouds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chavarría et al. 2010)</ref>; the coalescence of massive black holes in both isolated galactic nuclei (Narayan 2000) and colliding galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Armitage &amp; Natarajan 2005)</ref>; and the heating of intracluster gas by infalling galaxies (El-Zant, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kim, &amp; Kamionkowski 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the widespread occurrence of gaseous dynamical friction, there is still no generally accepted derivation of the force, even after 70 years of effort. The flow in the vicinity of the gravitating mass is complex both temporally and spatially, as many simulations have shown (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Matsuda, Inoue, &amp; Sawada 1987)</ref>. Theorists seeking a fully analytic expression for the time-averaged force have employed various strategems to circumvent a detailed description of this region. In the course of their classic studies of stellar accretion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bondi &amp; Hoyle (1944)</ref> took the star to be traversing a zero-temperature gas. In their model, fluid elements follow hyperbolic orbits in the star's reference frame and land in an infinitely thin, dense spindle behind the object. Bondi &amp; Hoyle analyzed the transfer of linear momentum from the spindle to the star, and hence obtained the force. <ref type="bibr">Dodd &amp; McCrae (1952)</ref> similarly investigated this hypersonic limit, as did, much more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cantó et al. (2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dokuchaev (1964)</ref> first treated a finitetemperature gas. He determined the force by integrating the total power emitted by the object in acoustic waves (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rephaeli &amp; Salpeter 1980)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ruderman &amp; Spiegel (1971)</ref> used an impulse approximation in the reference frame of the background gas. Finally, Ostriker (1999) calculated the force by integrating directly over the wake, whose density she obtained through a linear perturbation analysis.</p><p>These researchers focused principally on the supersonic case, which is often the most interesting one astrophysically. That is, they took V &gt; c s , where V is the speed of the gravitating mass relative to the distant background, and c s the sound speed in that gas. (In the hypersonic calculations of Bondi, Hoyle, and their successors, c s was implicitly set to zero.) While their answers differed in detail, all agreed that the friction force in this regime varies as V −2 , with a coefficient that includes a Coulomb logarithm. This latter term also appears in the force derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chandrasekhar (1943)</ref>, and arises from an integration in radius away from the mass. In all derivations, at least one of the integration limits is rather ill-defined.</p><p>The previous studies made two important, simplifying assumptions. First, they neglected any accretion of background gas by the moving object. Quantitatively, the assumption was that R ≫ r acc , where R is the object's physical radius and the accretion radius r acc ≡ 2 G M/V 2 is the distance from the mass M within which its gravity quali-tatively alters the background flow. They further ignored R compared to the scale for spatial variations in the surrounding flow. If L denotes the latter scale, then these assumptions may be summarized as L &gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt; r acc . Unfortunately, the inequality R &gt;&gt; r acc is often not satisfied. For example, a low-mass star moving through a cluster-producing molecular cloud has R ∼ 10 11 cm and r acc ∼ 10 16 cm. An analysis that covers this regime should treat the object as being point-like in all respects, allowing the possibility of mass accretion through infall.</p><p>This infall cannot occur via direct impact, since the geometrical cross section of the body is negligible by assumption. Instead, some fluid elements that initially miss the object are pulled back into it. Mass accretion is, in fact, closely related to dynamical friction. In the reference frame attached to the mass, the background gas flows by with a speed that approaches V far away. The steady-state accretion rate onto the object is simply the net influx of mass through any closed surface surrounding it. Similarly, the friction force is the net influx of linear momentum. Much closer to the mass, this momentum influx manifests itself as two distinct force components. One is the gravitational pull from the wake, as described earlier. A second component is the direct advection of linear momentum from any background gas that falls into the object. Any determination of the force by an asymptotic surface integration cannot tease apart these two contributions.</p><p>To clarify these ideas, <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.1 shows graphically the mass and momentum flow within the extended gas cloud surrounding the central, gravitating object. Gas enters the region via the dotted sphere shown in the sketch. This gas then follows one of three paths. Most of it leaves the sphere downstream of the gravitating mass, as shown by the two outermost streamlines (thin solid curves). Only a small fraction of the gas makes its way to the deep interior. Some of it accretes onto the mass, first missing it and then looping back. Other gas that misses more widely is temporarily slowed by the gravitational pull of the mass and forms an overdense wake, also sketched in the figure. In steady state, the wake cannot gain net mass, so all of the gas entering it also leaves, either by joining onto the mass or exiting the sphere directly. Meanwhile, the wake itself tugs on the mass gravitationally. The broad arrow in the figure depicts this second form of momentum input to the mass. It is possible to determine the force analytically by integrating the net momentum flux over the bounding sphere. Numerical simulations can obtain this same force by calculating the advective and gravitational components acting directly on the mass.</p><p>In a previous paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lee &amp; Stahler 2011</ref>, hereafter Paper I), we did the analytic surface integration. We focused on the subsonic case, V &lt; c s , which traditionally has been less explored. 1 Working in the reference frame whose origin is attached to the mass, we developed a perturbative method to analyze the small deviations of the background gas from a uniform, constant-density, flow. By integrating the perturbed variables over a large sphere to obtain the net momentum influx, we arrived at a surprisingly simple result for the force: F = ˙ M V . Here, ˙ M is the mass accre-tion rate onto the moving object. To evaluate this quantity from first principles, one would have to follow the trajectories of fluid elements as they accrete onto the central mass, and ensure that, following turnaround, they smoothly cross the sonic transition. This transition occurs well inside the region of validity for our calculation. Lacking a fundamental theory for ˙ M , we adopted a variant of the interpolation formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bondi (1952)</ref> and thus found the force explicitly as a function of velocity. In this subsonic regime, our expression agrees reasonably well with past simulations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ruffert 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Here we apply the same technique to study the supersonic case. We quickly encounter the technical difficulty that some perturbation variables diverge, when expressed as functions of the angle from the background velocity vector. The true flow around the gravitating mass is, of course, well-defined everywhere, and the divergences simply indicate that the adopted series expansions fail at certain locations. Despite this mathematical inconvenience, we are able once again to derive the dynamical friction force through spatial integration of the linear momentum influx. The force has exactly the same form as previously: F = ˙ M V . In the high-speed limit, we recover the V −2 behavior found by others, but not the Coulomb logarithm.</p><p>In Section 2 below, we describe our solution strategy, and then formulate the problem using a convenient, nondimensional scheme. Whenever material repeats that of Paper I, we abbreviate its presentation as much as possible. Section 3 analyzes the perturbed flow to first order only. In this approximation, we find there is no mass accretion or friction force, just as in the subsonic case. We extend the analysis to second order in Section 4, thus accounting for mass accretion. Here we also describe our method for calculating the flow numerically, and show sample results. Section 5 presents the analytic derivation of the force itself, and compares our expression to past simulations. Those found a greater force than we derive in the supersonic regime; we indicate possible causes for this discrepancy. Assuming our result to be correct, we present several representative applications. Finally, Section 6 compares our derivation to previous ones, and indicates directions for future work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Physical Assumptions</head><p>In the reference frame whose origin coincides with the mass, the background gas has speed V far from the object and a spatially uniform density, which we denote as ρ 0 . We take the gas to be isothermal, with associated sound speed c s . As depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>2, we will be working in a spherical coordinate system (r, θ), and will assume that the gas flow is axisymmetric about the polar (z-) axis, which is parallel to the asymptotic fluid velocity.</p><p>We neglect the self-gravity of the gas, and will be analyzing perturbations to the flow relatively far from the central mass. Specifically, our expansions are valid for r &gt;&gt; r s , where r s ≡ G M/c 2 s is the sonic radius. We assume that in the far-field region of interest, the flow is steady-state. Of course, a steady flow cannot be established over arbitrarily large distances, and one must judge, in each astrophysical situation, whether the assumption is justified. In numerical simulations, which we later discuss by way of comparison, the flow occurs within some fixed computational volume, at the center of which lies the mass. For the non-relativistic case of relevance, the force of gravity propagates instantaneously, but alterations in the flow density and velocity take time. In practice, a steady flow is indeed approached in many such experiments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pogorelov, Ohsugi, &amp; Matsuda 2000)</ref>. The observed decay of transients is instructive, but again is only broadly suggestive of what may occur in Nature.</p><p>Figure A.2 singles out two special angles, both of which only occur in supersonic flow. The first is the familiar Mach angle, defined through the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sin θ M ≡ 1/β ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where β ≡ V /c s . The second is the supplement of the first:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">θ ′ M ≡ π − θ M .</formula><p>The figure of revolution swept out by the radius lying along θ = θ M is the Mach cone, while we dub the analogous figure swept out by θ = θ ′ M the "antiMach cone." As <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>3 illustrates, we denote as the "upstream" region that portion of the flow bounded by the anti-Mach cone, while the "downstream" region lies within the Mach cone. Finally, the "intermediate" region has θ M &lt; θ &lt; θ ′ M . A significant feature of the flow surrounding a gravitating mass is the presence of an accretion bowshock. Any fluid element that joins onto the mass penetrates to r r acc , and encounters a shock at θ ∼ θ M . At much larger r, such bowshocks weaken and degenerate to acoustic pulses, before fading away entirely <ref type="bibr">(Zel'dovich &amp; Raizer 1968, Chap. 1)</ref>. No such shock arises near θ ′ M , even at relatively small distances. In summary, for r ≫ r s r acc , we do not expect any discontinuities at θ M or θ ′ M in steady-state flow, either in the fluid variables themselves or their derivatives. We need to keep this key point in mind as we encounter apparent discontinuities at both angles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Mathematical Formulation</head><p>As in Paper I, we describe the flow through two dependent variables, the mass density ρ(r, θ) and the stream function ψ(r, θ). Individual velocity components may be recovered from these through the relations</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">u r = 1 ρ r 2 sin θ ∂ψ ∂θ (2) u θ = −1 ρ r sin θ ∂ψ ∂r ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which automatically ensure mass continuity. In the extreme far-field limit, the stream function approaches that for the background, uniform flow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">lim r → ∞ ψ = ρ 0 V r 2 sin 2 θ 2 = ρ 0 c s r 2 s β sin 2 θ 2 r r s 2 .</formula><p>Our second form of the stream function's limit suggests how to expand ψ(r, θ) in a perturbation series valid for finite, but large, r:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ψ = ρ 0 c s r 2 s f 2 r r s 2 + f 1 r r s + f 0 + f −1 r r s −1 + ... .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Here, f 2 ≡ β sin 2 θ/2, while f 1 , f 0 , f −1 , etc, are as yet unknown, non-dimensional functions of β and θ. We write a similar perturbation expansion for the density:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ρ = ρ 0 1 + g −1 r r s −1 + g −2 r r s −2 + g −3 r r s −3 + ... .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The quantities g −1 , g −2 , and g −3 are again non-dimensional functions of β and θ, all of them unknown at this stage. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The dynamical equations will be simplified once we recast all variables into non-dimensional form. We let the fiducial radius, density, and speed be r s , ρ 0 , and c s , respectively, while we normalize the stream function to ρ 0 c s r 2 s . We will not change notation, but alert the reader whenever we revert to dimensional varables. Our fully non-dimensional perturbation series are</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ψ = f 2 r 2 + f 1 r + f 0 + f −1 r −1 + ...<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">ρ = 1 + g −1 r −1 + g −2 r −2 + g −3 r −3 + ... .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The task will be to solve for the various functions f i (θ) and g i (θ) appearing in these two series. (Henceforth, we will suppress the β-dependence for simplicity.) As explained in Section 2.3 of Paper I, the appropriate boundary conditions are</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">f i (π) = f ′ i (π) = f ′ i (0) = 0 for i = 1, 0, −1, −2, etc.</formula><p>, and f i (0) = 0 for i = 1, −1, −2, etc. These conditions ensure regularity of both u r and u θ , as given by equations (2) and (3), respectively, on both the upstream and downstream axes. Since sin θ → 0 on both axes, the r-and θ-derivatives of ψ must also vanish. Using the expansion of ψ in equation (6), we derive the aforementioned conditions. There is no associated restriction on f 0 (0), which is tied to the mass accretion rate onto the central object, as shown in Section 4 below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Upstream and Downstream Regions</head><p>The r-and θ-components of Euler's equation, in nondimensional form, are</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">u r ∂u r ∂r + u θ r ∂u r ∂θ − u 2 θ r = − 1 ρ ∂ρ ∂r − 1 r 2 (8) u r ∂u θ ∂r + u θ r ∂u θ ∂θ + u r u θ r = − 1 ρ r ∂ρ ∂θ .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Our procedure is first to express u r and u θ in terms of ψ and ρ, using equations (2) and (3). We then expand ψ and ρ themselves in their respective perturbation series and equate the coeffcients of various powers of r. To avoid cumbersome division by the series for ρ, we first multiply equations (8) and (9) through by ρ 3 . Equating the coefficients of the highest power of r, which is r −1 , we find that they are identically equal. Equating coefficients of r −2 yields the first-order equations. From equation (8), we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">− β f ′′ 1 − β f 1 + β 2 sin θ cos θ g ′ −1 + β 2 cos 2 θ − 1 g −1 + 1 = 0 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>while equation (9) yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">1 − β 2 sin 2 θ g ′ −1 − β 2 sin θ cos θ g −1 = 0 .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>These equations are identical in form to equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>, respectively, of Paper I, hereafter designated equations (I.18) and (I.19). However, their solutions may differ. The factor (1 − β 2 sin 2 θ) in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, which was positive in the subsonic case for any angle θ, can now be positive, negative, or zero.</p><p>Consider first the upstream region. For θ &gt; θ ′ M , the term (1 − β 2 sin 2 θ) is indeed positive, and we may recast equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d dθ 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 1/2 g −1 = 0 ,</formula><p>whose solution is</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">g −1 = C 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 1/2 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Here, C is independent of θ, but is possibly a function of β. The analogous result appeared in our subsonic analysis as equation <ref type="bibr">(I.20)</ref>. In that case, we ultimately found C to be unity. Returning to the supersonic flow, we see that, for any non-zero C, the function g −1 diverges at θ = θ ′ M . This fact does not mean that the density itself diverges at that location; there is no reason for it to do so. Rather, it is our series expansion of ρ (r, θ) that fails in this region. The issue here is mathematical, rather than physical. Although the function g −1 (θ) diverges, the associated term in the perturbation expansion, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(7)</ref>, is multiplied by r −1 . At any finite angular separation from θ ′ M , the first-order correction to the background density can be made arbitrarily small by considering a sufficiently large r-value. This observation suggests that the divergences encountered here and elsewhere in our analysis will vanish if we change independent variables from r and θ to another set that mixes the two. In any case, we do not explore that possibility in the present paper.</p><p>Substitution of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> for g −1 into (10) yields the governing equation for f 1 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f ′′ 1 + f 1 = 1 β − C 1 − β 2 β 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 3/2 .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>This equation, being identical to (I.21), has the same general solution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">f 1 = 1 β − C 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 1/2 β + D cos θ + E sin θ ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where D and E are additional constants. The vanishing of f 1 (π) tells us that D = (1 − C)/β, while f ′ 1 (π) = 0 implies that E = 0. Both relations also held in the subsonic case.</p><p>We next turn to the downstream region. Here again, the critical term (1 − β 2 sin 2 θ) is positive. The solutions for g −1 and f 1 are thus identical to the upstream solutions in equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>, if we replace C, D, and E by new constants C ′ , D ′ , and E ′ . Application of the appropriate boundary conditions then tells us that E ′ = 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">D ′ = (1 − C ′ )/β.</formula><p>Referring again to <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>3, the supersonic flow we are now analyzing differs from the subsonic one by the presence of the intermediate region, lying between the Mach and anti-Mach cones. As β decreases to unity from above, this region narrows symmetrically about θ = π/2 and ultimately vanishes, as does the physical distinction between the supersonic and subsonic flows. Continuity thus demands that, while (C, D) and (C ′ , D ′ ) could, in principle, be β-dependent, they are actually not. Instead, they must have the truly constant values (1, 0) found in the subsonic case.</p><p>In summary, the first-order flow in both the upstream and downstream regions is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">f 1 = 1 − 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 1/2 β (15) g −1 = 1 1 − β 2 sin 2 θ 1/2 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>After substituting these coefficients into the series expansions for ψ and ρ, one may calculate u r and u θ to linear order from equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_109">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>, respectively. At any fixed, r-value, however, the series representation for ρ fails sufficiently close to either Mach cone, and the velocity components cannot be obtained in this manner.</p><p>Comparing our results thus far with the previous literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dokuchaev (1964)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ruderman &amp; Spiegel (1971)</ref>, and Ostriker (1999) all obtained equation (12) for the downstream, first-order density distribution, but with C = 2. They also found that g −1 vanishes for θ &gt; θ M . In the subsonic analysis of Ostriker (1999), g −1 is everywhere finite. Thus, the density distributions in her supersonic and subsonic flows do not approach one another in the β = 1 limit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ruderman &amp; Spiegel (1971)</ref> further argued that the apparent divergence in the downstream density perturbation at θ = θ M signifies the presence of a bowshock. While a bowshock certainly arises relatively close to the gravitating mass, it does not persist into the far field, the only regime where an analysis based on small perturbations of the background gas is justified.</p></div>

Equation (2) tells us that ψ(r, θ) is the θ-integral of the mass flux ρ u r over a surface of radius r. More generally, the stream function is the net rate of mass transport into any surface of revolution extending from θ = 0 to the angle of interest. A discontinuity in ψ at an angle θ thus represents a thin sheet of mass being injected or ejected along the corresponding cone. If we are to reject such a solution as unphysical, then we must demand continuity of ψ. That is, f 1 must again approach 1/β at the two Mach cones, and D = E = 0 in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">(20)</ref>.</p><p>Our mathematical description of the first-order flow in the intermediate region is now</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">f 1 = 1 + C β 2 sin 2 θ − 1 1/2 β (21) g −1 = C β 2 sin 2 θ − 1 1/2 .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Since the intermediate region does not reach either the upstream or downstream axis, we cannot appeal to our usual boundary conditions in order to evaluate C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Near-Cone Divergence</head><p>Our plan is to integrate numerically two, coupled secondorder equations in order to determine the variables f ′ 0 and g −2 throughout the flow. With f ′ 0 in hand, another integration will yield f 0 itself. Before we embark on this program, let us consider more carefully the behavior of f ′ 0 and g −2 . In the upstream and downstream regions, the term D vanishes as one approaches either Mach cone. Thus, the source terms in equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> and (32) diverge in that limit. Similarly, the source terms in equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(33)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(34)</ref> diverge because of the vanishing of E. It is possible, then, that both f ′ 0 and g −2 also diverge at the cones. This is indeed the case. In this section, we first establish the divergences of f ′ 0 and g −2 in the downstream region only. That is, we assume that θ approaches θ M from below. Later in the section, we outline the derivation for the remaining regions of the flow. We then use the full result to shed light on the unknown parameter C.</p><p>Since θ &lt; θ M , we define the positive angle α ≡ θ M − θ, and assume that f ′ 0 and g −2 take the following asymptotic forms as α diminishes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">f ′ 0 = ζ α −m (36) g −2 = γ α −n ,<label>(37)</label></formula><p>where ζ, γ, m, and n are all functions of β only. If both f ′ 0 and g −2 truly diverge, then m and n are positive. Within equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(32)</ref>, we replace sin θ and cos θ by their limiting values, 1/β and β 2 − 1/β, respectively. We further note that D → 2α β 2 − 1. After differentiating the asymptotic forms of f ′ 0 and g −2 with respect to θ, we derive simplified, limiting forms of equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(32)</ref>. Expressed using α as the independent variable, these are</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">− m β ζ α −m−1 + n γ β 2 − 1 α −n−1 = − β 2 4 (β 2 − 1) α −1<label>(38)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_41">β ζ α −m + 2 (1 − n) γ β 2 − 1 α −n = 1 2 β 2 − 1 α −2 .<label>(39)</label></formula><p>In deriving these equations, we have retained only the most rapidly diverging terms on the righthand sides of equations (31) and (32).

The righthand side of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(39)</ref> is proportional to α −2 . For this equation to balance as α diminishes, one lefthand term could also diverge as α −2 , and the other more slowly. However, if this were the case, i.e., if either m = 2 &gt; n or n = 2 &gt; m, then equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(38)</ref> would be unbalanced. It is also posssible that the two lefthand terms in (39) diverge more rapidly than α −2 , balancing each other. We would then have m = n &gt; 2. Finally, all three terms in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(39)</ref> could diverge at the same rate: m = n = 2.</p><p>Assuming provisionally that m = n &gt; 2, then we may ignore the righthand terms of both equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(38)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(39)</ref> in the asymptotic limit.

Here, we may assume the same asymptotic forms for f ′ 0 and g −2 as in equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(36)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(37)</ref>, provided the independent variable α remains positive: α ≡ θ − θ M . Inserting these functional forms into the second-order equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(33)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(34)</ref>, we note that dα/dθ changes sign from -1 to +1, and that E now approaches 2 α β 2 − 1 near the cone. We then derive equations analogous to (38) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(39)</ref>, which may again be solved in the near-cone limit. After applying similar reasoning to the two regions surrounding the anti-Mach cone, we arrive at the following asymptotic forms for f ′ 0 and g −2 near θ M and θ ′ M :</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">f ′ 0 = −1 2β β 2 − 1 (θ M − θ) 2 θ &lt; ∼ θ M = C 2 2β β 2 − 1 (θ − θ M ) 2 θ &gt; ∼ θ M = −C 2 2β β 2 − 1 (θ ′ M − θ) 2 θ &lt; ∼ θ ′ M = 1 2β β 2 − 1 (θ − θ ′ M ) 2 θ &gt; ∼ θ ′ M .<label>(40)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">g −2 = −1 2 (β 2 − 1) (θ M − θ) 2 θ &lt; ∼ θ M = C 2 2 (β 2 − 1) (θ − θ M ) 2 θ &gt; ∼ θ M = C 2 2 (β 2 − 1) (θ ′ M − θ) 2 θ &lt; ∼ θ ′ M = −1 2 (β 2 − 1) (θ − θ ′ M ) 2 θ &gt; ∼ θ ′ M .<label>(41)</label></formula><p>Obtaining f 0 requires that we integrate f ′ 0 over θ. Starting at the upstream axis, with f 0 (π) = 0, the integrated f 0 (θ) diverges to positive infinity as θ approaches θ ′ M . However, the stream function has a direct physical meaning as the mass transfer rate into a surface of revolution. Since this rate is finite for any θ, the function f ′ 0 (θ) must be integrable across the anti-Mach cone. That is, the upward divergence of f ′ 0 for θ &gt; ∼ θ ′ M must be cancelled by a matching downward divergence for θ &lt; ∼ θ ′ M . A similar antisymmetry of the divergences must occur at the Mach cone, θ = θ M (see <ref type="figure">Fig. A.4</ref>). Inspection of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(40)</ref> shows that this requirement forces C 2 to be unity. The parameter C itself is either +1 or −1, independent of β.

We emphasize a key difference between equations (44) and (46).

In our numerical determination of the flow, to be described in Section 4.5 below, we verified that equation (44) indeed holds numerically both upstream and downstream. In contrast, we need to impose equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(46)</ref>, or an equivalent condition, to obtain a physically acceptable solution in the intermediate region.</p><p>Enforcing irrotationality in the intermediate region requires only that we impose this condition along any interior cone, i.e., at a θ-value such that θ M &lt; θ &lt; θ ′ M .

Projecting this vector equation along the rdirection gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">u θ ω φ = ∂B ∂r .</formula><p>This relation holds at fixed θ and φ. Since the flow is axisymmetric, the equation also holds at all φ-values, i.e., along a cone. If ω φ vanishes along such a cone, then B is constant on that surface: ∂B/∂r = 0. But we already know that B does not vary along any streamline. As <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.5 illustrates schematically, the additional constraint tells us that the B-values characterizing each streamline are identical, i.e., B is a true spatial constant. Thus, ∇B = 0 and, from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(23)</ref>, the flow is irrotational. In practice, we apply ω φ = 0 at θ = π/2, the equatorial plane of the flow. The irrotationality condition, expressed as equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(46)</ref>, implies that there is a unique (but β-dependent) value of g −2 at that angle:</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">g −2 (π/2) = 2 β 2 − 1 2 − 2 C β 2 − 1 3/2 + C β β 2 − 1 1/2 .<label>(47)</label></formula><p>When we find the flow numerically in the intermediate region, we will impose equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(47)</ref> as an initial condition.

We again employ physical reasoning. The value of C affects the shape of the streamlines, even in the first-order flow. Only one shape is reasonable dynamically. <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.6 shows streamlines of the first-order flow for the case β = 1.1. That is, we plot contours of constant f 2 r 2 + f 1 r. In the upstream and donwstream regions, f 1 is taken from equation (15). For the intermediate region, we use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21)</ref>, with both C = +1 (solid curves) and C = −1 (dashed curves). For either choice of the parameter, we see that all first-order streamlines are symmetric about the equatorial plane, as we found in the subsonic flow (see, e. g., <ref type="figure">Fig. I.2)</ref>. The kinks at both Mach cones result from the crudeness of this first-order approximation, and would disappear in successively more accurate treatments. The solid curves in <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.6 bow inward, toward the central mass, both upstream of the anti-Mach cone and inside it. Such inward turning results naturally from the gravitational pull of the mass. Eventually, the concurrent rise in density and pressure pushes the gas outward. If we were instead to choose C = −1, the streamlines in the intermediate region would bow outward, which is not expected.</p><p>We may also consider the matter more quantitatively by examining the velocity component u R . Here R is the cylindrical radius: R ≡ r sin θ. In the far-field limit, u R tends to zero, since the background flow is in the zdirection. Closer to the equatorial plane, but still upstream, u R should be slightly negative. Downstream, this velocity component should reverse sign as each streamline rejoins the background flow. Starting with the expreessions for f 1 and g −1 in the intermediate region, we first calculate u r and u θ from equations (2) and (3), and then obtain u R ≡ u r sin θ + u θ cos θ. We find that</p><formula xml:id="formula_63">u R = C − E 1/2 r β E 1/2 cot θ .</formula><p>Upstream from the mass (θ &gt; π/2), we have cot θ &gt; 0. Thus, if C = −1, then u R &gt; 0 in this direction. Conversely, u R &lt; 0 downstream from the mass. This behavior is contrary to the physically reasonable one, so we conclude that C = +1.</p></div>

Starting at the upstream axis, θ = π, we set f 0 (π) = f ′ 0 (π) = 0. We provisionally treat g −2 (π) as a free parameter, to be determined later in order to ensure smoothness of the flow across the Mach cones, as we describe in more detail below. For any selected g −2 (π), we may then integrate equations (31) and (32) to the antiMach cone, θ = θ ′ M . Simultaneous integration of f ′ 0 yields f 0 itself. But knowledge of both g −2 (π) and f 0 (0) also gives us g −2 (0), according to equation (50). Since f ′ 0 (0) = 0, we may again integrate the second-order equations equations (31) and (32), along with f ′ 0 , from θ = 0 to θ = θ M . At this point, we have established a one-parameter family of flows covering both the upstream and downstream regions. For any value of g −2 (π), both flows are irrotational, as required physically.</p><p>Turning to the intermediate region, we begin at the equatorial plane, θ = π/2. We use equation (47) for g −2 (π/2), again setting C = +1. Our free parameter is now f ′ 0 (π/2). For any value of this quantity, we integrate equations (33) and (34) away from the plane in both directions until we come to the Mach cones. We have then established the run of f ′ 0 and g −2 throughout the intermediate region. Again, the flow is irrotational for any value of f ′ 0 (π/2). 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.3.">Enforcing Smoothness</head><p>Within the intermediate region, we only know f 0 up to a constant of integration, which has yet to be fixed. In addition, <ref type="bibr">we</ref> have not yet determined our two free parameters, f ′ 0 (π/2) and g −2 (π). All three quantities are specified by requiring that the flow be smoothly varying. If f ′ 0 and g −2 were well-defined everywhere, this task would be straightforward. For example, we could tune one parameter until g −2 , as calculated in the downstream region, matched the intermediate g −2 at the Mach cone. However, both f ′ 0 and g −2 diverge at the cones. Hence, we can only require smoothness outside some finite region surrounding each cone.</p><p>We therefore stopped each integration at a point where the divergent behavior begins to dominate.

Finally, we chose f ′ 0 (π/2) and g −2 (π) so that f 0 and g −2 matched as closely as possible across these boundaries.</p><p>A convenient measure of the goodness of fit is</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">χ 2 ≡ ∆g 2 −2 (θ ′ M ) + ∆f 2 0 (θ M ) + ∆g 2 −2 (θ M ) .<label>(52)</label></formula><p>Here, ∆g −2 (θ ′ M ) is difference of g −2 across the anti-Mach cone, and the two other quantities are analogously defined.

As we varied both f ′ 0 (π/2) and g −2 (π), the quantity χ reached a well-defined minimum. <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>7 shows χ-contours for the case β = 1.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.4.">Sample Results</head><p>With the numerical procedure in hand, we could determine the second-order flow for any desired β. <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>8 displays streamlines for β = 1.1. Even in this modestly supersonic case, the two Mach cones depart substantially from the equatorial plane (θ M = 65 • ), and the isodensity contours are a set of nearly vertical lines that bow inward slightly toward the mass. The shaded interiors of the wedges straddling each Mach cone represent the excluded sectors within which the divergent behavior dominates. We previously indicated the excluded region surrounding the Mach cone by the shading in <ref type="figure">Figure A.4</ref>.</p><p>Returning to <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.8, we notice that the streamlines in the intermediate region have the expected concavity, but are not precisely symmetric across the equatorial plane. For example, a cone with a half angle of θ = 50 • cuts the outermost streamlines shown at a radius that is 1% closer downstream than upstream. Notice also how the innermost streamlines join onto the central mass. The surface of revolution they generate encloses the full ˙ M , and the figure illustrates that mass accretion occurs in this order of approximation. However, we cannot obtain the detailed behavior of the flow as it joins onto the mass, since our perturbation series is only valid well outside r = 1, the boundary indicated here as the central, dashed circle. <ref type="figure">Figure A.9</ref> shows the angular variation of f ′ 0 (dashed curve) and g −2 (dotted curve) for this same β-value. As in <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.8, the shaded regions mark those sectors where both variables diverge. By design, the coefficients diverge antisymmetrically as either cone is approached. This behavior is not evident in the figure, which appears to show a symmetric divergence. In more detail, both f ′ 0 and g −2 first rise when approaching the Mach cone from downstream, then reach a peak and plunge downward (recall <ref type="figure">Fig. A.4)</ref>. They exhibit analogous behavior upstream of the anti-Mach cone.</p><p>The solid curve in <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.9 shows the integrated f 0 . The upstream and downstream values of this coefficient match exactly at the anti-Mach cone. We forced this match by adjusting the integration constant within the intermediate region. The values of f 0 on either side of the Mach cone have a ratio of 1.6. This ratio depends both on our choices of f ′ (π/2) and g −2 (π/2), and on the precise manner by which we excise the divergent region surrounding the Mach cone. Within our scheme, the mismatch is a weak function of the parameter α.</p><p>As an additional example, <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.10 displays streamlines of the second-order flow for β = 2.0. Here, both cones are even more removed from the equatorial plane (θ M = 30 • ), and the fluid elements are nearly following straight-line trajectories. The innermost pair shown here nevertheless still bends to reach the origin. Quantitatively, the fluid is affected significantly by gravity if it passes within the accretion radius r acc , which varies as β −2 . Notice also that the figure of revolution generated by the innermost streamlines is much narrower than in <ref type="figure">Figure A.</ref>8. This narrowing reflects the fact that ˙ M decreases steeply with β as the Mach number climbs significantly above unity.</p><p>We remind the reader that both <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.8 and A.10 are just approximations to the actual flow. The calculated flow would become more accurate at any fixed r ≫ r s with the inclusion of higher-order terms in the perturbation series. However, the mathematical divergences at the Mach and anti-Mach cones would remain. Because of these divergences, streamlines tend to bend unphysically toward both cones. Our procedure above was designed to prevent these divergences from unduly influencing the shapes of the streamlines, at least to this order in the perturbation expansion.</p></div>

Although the force involves the factor ˙ M , our expression holds even for a porous, non-accreting object, such as a globular cluster traversing a galactic halo. The result also applies to a mass that is expelling its own gas, e.g., a wind-emitting star. In that case, the wind can only penetrate a limited distance before it shocks against the background flow. The dynamical friction force then acts on both the mass and its trapped wind. Our only requirement is that the background gas well outside of r s be undisturbed. This last stipulation is overly conservative. Mathematical convenience originally motivated our choice of r s as the characteristic length scale. For supersonic flows, however, streamlines deviate from the background not inside r s , but instead inside r acc ∼ r s /β 2 &lt; r s . Numerical simulations show this effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shima et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ruffert 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. 2013</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Comparison with Simulations</head><p>The numerical simulation of gas streaming past a stationary, gravitating mass has a long history. In an early work, Hunt (1971) investigated a fluid with an adiabatic index of γ = 5/3, and with incident Mach numbers ranging from 0.6 to 2.4. A study more directly relevant to ours is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shima et al. (1985)</ref>, whose suite of axisymmetric simulations included a γ = 1.1 gas with Mach numbers again up to 2.4. The authors calculated both contributions to the friction force F -the gravitational tug from the wake, determined by integration over the density around the mass, and the advection of linear momentum through the surface of this body, a force variously called the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic drag. Despite the nomenclature, they found that this second contribution is actually a forward thrust, directed oppositely to the gravitational force. Recall that external gas does not impact the mass directly, but misses it and enters from downstream, thus imparting momentum in the upstream direction. The total force found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shima et al. (1985)</ref> is greater than ours. These authors define a drag coefficient c d through the relation F = 2 π c d ρ 0 G 2 M 2 /V 2 and an effective accretion radius r eff through ˙ M = π r 2 eff ρ 0 V . It follows that</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">F ˙ M V = c d 2 r acc r eff 2 .</formula><p>Using their <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure A</ref>.9, we infer that, for β = 0.6, 1.4, and 2.4, F/ ˙ M V = 1.0, 2.4, and 3.6, respectively. Note that the radius R of their accreting object varied with Mach number. It was set to 0.1 times r acc , so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_88">R = 0.2 r s /β 2 .</formula><p>In a later study, Sánchez-Salcedo &amp; Brandenburg (1999) simulated the flow of an isothermal gas around a mass whose physical size R excceds r acc by a factor of 20 or more. Under these conditions, the density enhancement in the wake is relatively mild. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sánchez-Salcedo &amp; Brandenburg (1999)</ref> switched on the gravity from the central mass suddenly, as in the calculation of Ostriker (1999). They found that their computed gravitational portion of the force closely matched Ostriker's analytical prediction. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kim &amp; Kim (2009)</ref>, who adopted γ = 5/3, showed that this contribution to the force declines when R falls well below r acc (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 14)</ref>.</p><p>The most thorough numerical investigation of the flow pattern, mass accretion rate, and friction force for the isothermal case has been that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ruffert (1996)</ref>. In this three-dimensional simulation of a γ = 1.01 gas, both the accretor size and Mach number were varied, the latter up to β = 10. A general result, which corroborated and extended those of previous studies, was that the downstream region exhibited continuing instability for relatively small masses (R ≪ r s ) embedded in supersonic flow. These, of course, are just the conditions of most interest for our purposes. Ruffert (1996) reported time-averaged results for both ˙ M and F in such cases. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> displays the essential results found by Ruffert (1996), both for his subsonic simulations (β = 0.6) and supersonic ones. We have only taken data from the runs in which the central mass was the smallest size. Here, the radius was 0.02 times r acc . We see that, even for β = 0.6, R is less than r s , as our own study assumes. In addition to β, other non-dimensional quantities shown in the table include: ˙ M , the mass accretion rate; ˙ P grav , the gravitational contribution to the force; ˙ P adv , the advective component; and their sum ˙ P tot , which is also the force F . Notice that ˙ P tot is positive, i.e., it points in the +z-direction in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure A.</ref>2. The quantity ˙ P adv is negative in all cases, and</p><p>Article number, page 12 of 21</p><note type="other">Lee &amp; Stahler: Dynamical Friction in a Gas smaller in magnitude than ˙ P tot , so that the net force indeed retards the motion of the mass relative to the background gas.</note><p>As the seventh column of the table shows, ˙ P tot is not equal to ˙ M β. Even for β ∼ 1, the ratio ˙ P tot / ˙ M β exceeds unity, and inreases with β, as found earlier by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shima et al. (1985)</ref>. If there is no error in our theoretical derivation, what could be the source of this discrepancy?</p><p>A successful simulation must replicate the flow well in inside of r acc . This task becomes more demanding at higher β, since r acc itself varies as β −2 . Following how the gas joins onto the central object is especially critical. Suppose, for example, that the velocity of material just outside the gravitating mass were, for any reason, artificially low in a simulation. Then, for a given ˙ M , mass conservation dictates that the density close to the object be increased. Also increased would be the value of ˙ P grav , which is obtained by integrating over the surrounding density. Conversely, ˙ P adv would be decreased, since it is proportional to the angle-averaged incoming speed. Both factors would cause the numerically determined ˙ P tot to be too large. Only a modest lowering of the speed creates a significant rise in ˙ P tot . To illustrate the point, we correct for this effect by lowering the numerically calculated ˙ P grav at each β-value by a factor f , where f &gt; 1. Simultaneously, we let ˙ P adv be increased by the same factor. There is some value of f such that ˙ P tot equals ˙ M β:</p><formula xml:id="formula_89">˙ P grav /f + f ˙ P adv = ˙ M β .</formula><p>This special f -value is listed in the last column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. As β increases by almost a factor of 20, f is always close to unity and varies only from 1.2 to 1.3. Thus, relatively small errors in the two force contributions, if they are inversely related, make a big difference in ˙ P tot . In an earlier paper outlining his numerical method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ruffert (1994)</ref> stated that he softened the gravitational potential of the central mass specifically to keep the incoming velocity relatively low and thereby lengthen the computational time step (see his §2.4). Needless to say, a softened potential indeed creates such an effective deceleration. So does numerical viscosity. In the Piecewise Parabolic code that <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ruffert (1994)</ref> employed, the viscosity in a region spanned by N zones scales as N −3 <ref type="bibr">(Porter &amp; Woodward 1994, p. 319)</ref>. For all his isothermal simulations, Ruffert (1996) used a relatively coarse grid surrounding the mass, which typically had five zones covering a distance outside the object equal to its radius.</p><p>Since the work of Ruffert (1996), other researchers have tackled this flow problem with improved codes. Results have evolved substantially. From <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ruffert (1996)</ref> found ˙ M = 0.994 for β = 1.4. In comparison, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(51)</ref>, which is a fit from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Moeckel &amp; Throop (2009)</ref> to their own simulations, gives ˙ M = 0.409 for the same β-value. A fresh determination of the force, using modern numerical techniques, would clearly be of interest.</p><p>We stress that both ˙ M and ˙ P tot at each β should not only be calculated in the vicinity of the central mass, but also through a far-field integration. Agreement of the results obtained by these two methods would, of course, strongly corroborate the accuracy of the simulation, and also be a sensitive test that the flow has indeed reached steady state. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> </p></div>

The figure includes one subsonic case, β 0 = 0.5. Notice that, when the mass starts out at supersonic speed, it first decelerates gradually, then much more sharply as β nears unity. Concurrently, its mass climbs rapidly, ultimately increasing at the Bondi rate appropriate for a stationary particle.</p><p>Turning to more concrete astrophysical applications, the frictional force may play an important role in the dynamical evolution of planets. In a relatively large fraction of exoplanets discovered through radial velocity studies, the normal to the orbital plane is misaligned with the stellar spin axis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albrecht et al. 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Recently, Teyssandier, Terquem, &amp; Papaloizou (2013)</ref> have simulated the evolution of an inclined, eccentric planet at the early epoch when a circumstellar disk is still present.

The critical mass separating these two regimes must depend on the prescription for the frictional drag.</p><p>Teyssandier, Terquem, &amp; Papaloizou (2013) used, for this drag, both that arising from direct impact with the gas and the hypersonic limit of the force derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ostriker (1999)</ref>.

Accretion onto these 10 9 M ⊙ objects powers the bright quasars detected at redshifts of z ∼ 6, i.e., about 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. The most popular hypothesis is that supermassive black holes arise through the merger of "seed" black holes (M ∼ 10 2 M ⊙ ), which are in turn the remnants of the first stellar generation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Heger et al. 2003</ref>). The mergers occur within the dark matter haloes of coalescing galaxies. An individual black hole also accretes gas that has settled toward the center of its parent halo.</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">F F T = β 3 λ 2 + β 2 1/2 (1 + β 2 ) 2 I ,</formula><p>In a combined semi-analytic and numerical study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tanaka &amp; Haiman (2009)</ref> showed that seed black holes can indeed form a supermassive one in the requsite time, provided they remain embedded in the halo's gas component. Mass buildup is delayed by the large recoil velocities in the coalesced product of each black hole merger. (Asymmetric gravitation radiation carries off the remaining momentum.) Promoting the merger process is dynamical friction, which can return far-flung black holes to the halo center. For their detailed numerical simulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tanaka &amp; Haiman (2009)</ref> assumed the total friction force to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">F tot = F DF + ˙ M V ,</formula><p>where ˙ M is the mass accretion rate of surrounding gas. They took the dynamical friction force F DF to be the sum of that due to the collisionless sea of dark matter and that created by the gas. For the latter, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tanaka &amp; Haiman (2009)</ref> adopted the formula of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ostriker (1999)</ref>.</p><p>According to our own study, the last term above encompasses the entire gaseous dynamical friction. That is, the dynamical friction force assumed in the simulations is too large in magnitude. A diminished F tot would increase the frequency of black hole ejections, as well as the time over which black holes flung outward remain on their extended orbits. In summary, the growth of supermassive black holes is delayed. As in the planetary problem, a revised calculation incorporating the corrected dynamical friction would be of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Two key assumptions underlie our derivation, and we reiterate these as a cautionary note. The first is that the geometric size of the gravitating mass be appropriately small. Specifically, we assume that R ≪ r acc . In the opposite extreme, R ≫ r acc , the main force acting on the object is not gravitational in origin, but comes from the direct impact of surrounding gas. This impact force is given dimensionally by F imp ≈ πρ 0 R 2 V 2 . The ratio of this force to that of dynamical friction is</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">F imp F ≈ 1 ˙ M β 3 R r acc 2 ,<label>(70)</label></formula><p>where ˙ M is non-dimensional. According to equation (51), the product ˙ M β 3 approaches a constant for β ≫ 1. Our second assumption is that the gas surrounding the object be sufficiently rarefied that its self-gravity is negligible. Once the amount of mass within the radius r acc becomes comparable to or exceeds that of the central object, the problem becomes one of gravitational collapse. Here, accretion generally does not occur in a steady-state manner (see also Section 5 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The present dynamical friction calculation differs sharply both in approach and result from previous efforts. Starting with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bondi &amp; Hoyle (1944)</ref>, all other researchers have obtained expressions for the force that contain a Coulomb logarithm. This term arises from integrating over the perturbed gas, usually in the downstream wake <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bondi &amp; Hoyle 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ostriker 1999</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dokuchaev (1964)</ref> also obtained this term, but by integrating the acoustic energy flux over a large sphere surrounding the gravitating mass. His derivation is thus closer in spirit to ours. However, we are dubious of his basic premise that the total energy loss associated with the moving mass is fully accounted for by this outgoing, acoustic disturbance. Accretion generates shocks close to the mass, and the power from radiating shocks could in principle rival the acoustic loss, for a sufficiently high velocity. On the other hand, the total inflow of linear momentum is always transported unaltered to the object itself, provided the surrounding flow is steady-state.</p><p>The strategy we adopted was to use a spherical coordinate system and expand the far-field perturbations of the stream function and density in power series in the radius r. We found that various coefficients in these series diverged at both the Mach and anti-Mach cones. Since the series themselves are only valid far from the gravitating mass, these divergences are purely mathematical, and result from the specific form of the perturbation series. It may be, therefore, that all divergences could be eliminated through an appropriate change of independent variables. We leave this technical issue as a topic of future study.</p><p>Turning to our specific result, we find it compelling that the friction force in the present, supersonic case is identical in form to that found in Paper I for objects moving subsonically. Our final expression is, in fact, so simple that it raises the question of whether the complex machinery we brought to bear was necessary for its derivation. As one alternative path, consider the fact that the velocity V is the momentum per unit mass carried by the background gas. Multiplying V by ˙ M , the mass accreted per time, immediately yields the rate of momentum input, which is the force.</p><p>This concise derivation is intuitively appealing, but is also incorrect. While V is the limiting velocity of background gas at infinite distance from the mass, the true velocity differs at any finite r. Similarly, the true density differs from its background value. These differences are relatively small, but they are integrated over a large surface to obtain the net inflow of momentum. As may be seen in Section 5.1, this inflow is ˙ M V plus several correction terms of comparable magnitude. These additional terms cancel exactly, by virtue of the fact that the flow is irrotational. A more explicit demonstration of the analogous, subsonic result is in Section 5.2 of Paper I.</p><p>In any event, we do agree that a simpler derivation of our result should exist, provided the far-field flow is irrotational. Equivalently, the generalized derivation must apply to barytropic fluids, i.e., those in which P is a function only of ρ. In support of this contention, we note that <ref type="bibr">Khajenabi &amp; Dib (2012)</ref> utilized our technique of far-field integration to show that F = ˙ M V holds for an object moving subsonically through an isentropic fluid with arbitrary adiabatic index γ. We expect that analogous reasoning will yield the same result for an isentropic fluid in the supersonic regime. At that point, the stage will be set for the new derivation, one that avoids a detailed description of the far-field flow. Whether one will still need to assume a steady-state mass accretion rate, as we have done, or be able to derive this rate from first principles, remains to be seen.</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. leestahler13_supersonicfriction Here we evaluate ˙ P 2 and ˙ P 1 , the first two coefficients on the righthand side of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(55)</ref>.
