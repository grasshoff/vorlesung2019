			<abstract>
				<p>By analysing a database of 26 years of observations of Jupiter with the Nançay Decameter Array, we unambiguously identify the radio emissions caused by the Ganymede-Jupiter interaction. We study the energetics of these emissions via the distributions of their intensities, duration, and power, and compare them to the energetics of the Io-Jupiter radio emissions. This allows us to demonstrate that the average emitted radio power is proportional to the Poynting flux from the rotating Jupiter&apos;s magnetosphere intercepted by the obstacle. We then generalize this result to the radio-magnetic scaling law that appears to apply to all plasma interactions between a magnetized flow and an obstacle, magnetized or not. Extrapolating this scaling law to the parameter range corresponding to hot Jupiters, we predict large radio powers emitted by these objects, that should result in detectable radio flux with new-generation radiotelescopes. Comparing the distributions of the durations of Ganymede-Jupiter and Io-Jupiter emission events also suggests that while the latter results from quasi-permanent Alfvén wave excitation by Io, the former likely results from sporadic reconnection between magnetic fields Ganymede and Jupiter, controlled by Jupiter&apos;s magnetic field geometry and modulated by its rotation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Nearly 4000 exoplanets have been discovered in the past two decades (http://exoplanet.eu), but little is known yet on their interior and their rotation. It has been demonstrated that detection of their non-thermal magnetospheric radio emission will provide unique information on their magnetic field (and thus their internal structure), their rotation (directly testing spin-orbit synchronization), their orbit inclination, and the presence of satellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hess &amp; Zarka 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zarka et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lazio et al. 2017</ref>). Solar system exploration has revealed that the magnetospheres of Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, although resulting from the same basic plasma physics processes, show a remarkable diversity of structure and dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bagenal 2013</ref>). The cyclotron maser instability (CMI) has been identified as the ubiquitous mechanism that produces the dominant high-latitude low-frequency radio emissions from these magnetospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Zarka 1998)</ref>. It is therefore expected that the detection of CMI emissions from star-exoplanet systems will shed light on their plasma interactions and open a new field of comparative exo-magnetospheric physics. Moreover, the existence of a substantial planetary magnetic field seems to favour the planet's capability to host life as it protects the atmosphere against bombardment by cosmic rays, stellar flares, and coronal mass ejections, and limits atmospheric escape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grießmeier et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grießmeier et al. , 2005</ref>).</p><p>In our solar system, the most intense radio emission is the decameter-wave radiation emitted by Jupiter's magnetosphere. However, although it is often as bright as solar radio bursts at frequencies below 40 MHz, it is at least 10 3−4 times too weak to be detectable against the statistical fluctuations of the galactic radio background at a distance of several parsecs, even with the largest existing low-frequency radiotelescopes like UTR-2 and LOFAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zarka 2007</ref>). The central questions conditioning radio searches for exoplanets are as follows. (1) How much can radio emissions be stronger than Jupiter's planetary -or planetinduced -emission? (2) How does one select the best targets to observe?</p><p>In spite of our good understanding of the CMI, there is no simple answer from first principles because the wave growth depends on the detailed distribution of keV electrons in the source and the final radio intensity depends on the source structure and size as well as on the interplay of wave convection with various saturation processes (quasi-linear diffusion, non-linear trapping). Empirical scaling laws were therefore derived for answering the above questions, in which the primary engine of the radio emission is the kinetic or magnetic power input from the solar wind to planetary magnetospheres. Average radio powers emitted by planetary magnetospheres were indeed found to be proportional to both the bulk kinetic energy flux and the magnetic energy (or Poynting) flux from the solar intercepted by the magnetosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zarka et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zarka 2007)</ref>. This double correlation comes from the fact that the kinetic and magnetic energy fluxes carried by the solar wind remain in a constant ratio (∼170) between the Earth and Neptune. Determining which one of the two is the real physical driver of the radio emissions is crucial for selecting observation targets. If it is the kinetic energy flux, we should select exoplanets orbiting massive stars with a large mass-loss rate (e.g. O' <ref type="bibr">Gorman et al. 2018)</ref>. If it is the magnetic energy flux, we should aim at exoplanets orbiting strongly magnetized stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Folsom et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Folsom et al. , 2018</ref>. In both cases, close-in exoplanets (hot Jupiters) should be interesting targets because both energy fluxes increase with decreasing distance to the star.</p><p>In order to determine which scaling law applies, the paradigm of solar wind-planet interaction was generalized to the interaction between a magnetized flow and a conductive obstacle (magnetized or not), leading to dissipation of the flow's power (kinetic and magnetic) on the obstacle, a fraction of which goes into electron acceleration and precipitation generating radio emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Zarka 2017)</ref>. This paradigm can be applied to satellite-Jupiter interactions. Only the Io-Jupiter (hereafter I-J) radio emission is quantitatively documented so far, and it seems compatible with the radio-magnetic scaling law only, rough estimates only being available for the other Jovian moons ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zarka et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zarka 2007)</ref>. Unlike bodies embedded in the solar wind, interaction of Jupiter's magnetosphere with the Jovian moons is dominated by the flow of magnetic energy. This flow proceeds via Alfvén wave excitation at Io ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Saur et al. 2004</ref>), and magnetic reconnection at Ganymede which possesses an intrinsic magnetic field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kivelson et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Here we analyze the database of 26 years of radio observations of Jupiter with the Nançay Decameter Array, built by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marques et al. (2017a)</ref>. In Sect. 2, we detail the unambiguous detection of Ganymede-Jupiter (hereafter G-J) decameter emission from this database. Over 350 G-J emission events are detected, that constitute the basis for the first quantitative study of their energetics (intensity, duration and power) <ref type="bibr">(Sect. 3)</ref>, that is then compared to the energetics of I-J emissions. In Sect. 4, we combine the results obtained for I-J and G-J emissions to the scaling laws relating radio powers to incident kinetic or magnetic energy fluxes, and we show that the radio-magnetic scaling law provides a general frame for all radio emissions resulting from a flow-obstacle interaction. Then, we extrapolate this scaling law to the hot Jupiters regime and predict radio powers -and hence flux densities -10 3−7 times stronger than Jupiter's. Finally, in Sect. 5 we discuss emission detectability, relevance and limitations of the radio-magnetic scaling law, and further consequences of our study on the timescales of magnetic reconnection between Ganymede and Jupiter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Statistical identification of Ganymede-Jupiter radio emission</head><p>I-J decametric radio emission was first identified in 1964 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bigg 1964)</ref>. Similar radio emissions induced or triggered by the other Galilean satellites have been searched for with the same technique as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bigg (1964)</ref>. Probabilities of radio emission occurrence are built as two-dimensional (2D) histograms with bins of a few degrees of observer's longitude, that is, central meridian longitude (CML) which varies with the planetary rotation, and of orbital phase Φ of the considered satellite. One influence of the satellite on the radio emissions results in regions of enhanced occurrence probability in the CML-Φ plane and in a non-uniform distribution in orbital phase. The results for Io are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1a</ref> The non-Io emissions (vertical bands of higher occurrence rate covering restricted CML ranges at all Io phases), which include auroral radio emissions as well as emissions possibly caused by satellites other than Io, also display time-frequency shapes and polarizations that can be classified in A, B, C, and D categories similar to I-J ones (i.e. northern and southern sources seen near both limbs of the planet) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marques et al. 2017a</ref>). Radio emissions induced by the other Jovian satellites have been searched among non-Io emissions. Past searches of G-J emissions in spacecraft (Voyager, Galileo, Cassini) observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zarka et al. 2017</ref>, and refs. therein) provided statistical hints of their existence, in data sets spanning intervals of no longer than 2 years (the longest one having been recorded by the Galileo spacecraft). A recent re-analysis of Voyager and Cassini observations provided convincing event-by-event identifications of Ganymede-and Europa-induced radio arcs in the time-frequency plane, but without studying the intensity of these emissions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Louis et al. 2017a</ref>).</p><p>The recent construction of a 26-year-long database 1 from daily observations of Jupiter with the Nançay Decameter Array from 1990 to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Marques et al. 2017a</ref>) allowed us to build occurrence probability diagrams versus CML and Ganymede's orbital phase (hereafter Φ Ga ), one order of magnitude more sensitive than in previous studies due to the much broader statistical basis. In addition, because each emission event is identified individually in the database (e.g. as non-Io-A, Io-C, etc.), the search for G-J emissions can be done separately for each non-Io emission type, which proved to be more efficient. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the CML−Φ Ga occurrence probability diagrams built for each nonIo component. A first analysis showed that no emission event with frequency &gt;33 MHz is detected in regions of enhanced probability in the CML−Φ Ga plane for non-Io-A and non-Io-B (northern) emissions. This is due to the fact that the northern footprint of the Ganymede flux tube lies northward of the northern high-amplitude magnetic anomaly at the surface of Jupiter crossed by the northern Io flux tube footprint, meaning that lower electron cyclotron frequencies are reached compared to I-J emissions. Similarly, no emission event with a frequency &gt;27 MHz is detected in regions of enhanced probability in the CML−Φ Ga plane for non-Io-C and non-Io-D (southern) emissions. For each non-Io component (each row in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), we show first the distribution of occurrence probability in CML−Φ Ga (left), then the occurrence rate versus Φ Ga obtained by integration of the 2D histogram along the CML axis (centre), and finally the occurrence versus Φ Ga obtained by integration only over the CML range in which a region of enhanced probability shows up in the CML−Φ Ga diagram (right). Ganymede-Jupiter emissions show up within new regions of enhanced occurrence (white boxes), labelled A to D in reference to the non-Io components in which they have been identified (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> for details).</p><p>ond row (panels d, e, f ), at &gt; 6σ level. This peak has a twocomponent structure, and therefore by analogy with I-J emissions we defined Ganymede-B and Ganymede-B' regions. In the third row (panels g, h, i), the Ganymede-C emission stands out as a prominent peak at &gt; 13σ level. Finally in the fourth row (panels j, k, l), the Ganymede-D emission is tentatively and marginally detected (at &gt; 3σ level only, around Φ Ga ∼ 200 • ). The rectangular boxes delimiting the detected G-J regions are reproduced on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1b</ref>. The numbers of G-J emission events contained in these boxes are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, for each G-J emission type, and compared to the number of non-Io and Io emissions of similar type.</p><p>Figures 3a and 3b compare the CML−Φ Io distribution of I-J emissions only with the CML−Φ Ga distribution of G-J emissions only. We note that bins with non-zero occurrence probability exist beyond the limits of the boxes, because when part of an emission event intersects a box, the entire event is counted as an I-J or G-J emission. The distributions show qualitative similarities, although the detailed CML and phase ranges are not identical (this was expected because these ranges result from the visibility of the radio emissions that depends on their source positions near the satellite footprints and on their three-dimensional (3D) beaming patterns). The G-J regions confirm the previous detections based on spacecraft data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Louis et al. 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zarka et al. 2017</ref>, and references therein), but with a much higher signalto-noise ratio. Differences with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Louis et al. (2017a)</ref> in the detailed region boundaries are attributed to the different frequency ranges of the observations studied. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref>, the integrated occurrence probability of all I-J emissions is plotted as a function of Io's jovicentric longitude (Λ Io = CML+180 • − Φ Io ). The contents of all white boxes of panel a naturally merge to form a single broad peak, that corresponds to the longitude range of the physical sources of I-J radio emission in Jupiter's magnetic field. Similarly, in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3d</ref>, all G-J components merge as a single peak of occurrence probability versus Ganymede's longitude (Λ Ga = CML+180 • − Φ Ga ), strongly supporting the correct identification of G-J emission events. Although marginally detected, the  <ref type="bibr">tween 1990</ref><ref type="bibr">tween and 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">tween (Marques et al. 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lamy et al. 2017</ref>). The numbers are listed separately for types A (+A' and A"), B (+B'), C and D, for Io-Jupiter emissions (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a)</ref>, non-Io emissions (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  1b</ref>, excluding Ganymede-Jupiter regions), and Ganymede-Jupiter emissions (cf. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b)</ref>. Each event has a duration of a few tens of minutes and counts as 1 in the histograms of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Io-Jupiter</head><p>Non Ganymede-D component contributes to the left side of the curve in panel d, analogous to Io-D emission in panel c, and therefore we retained it in our analysis (it only represents a small number of G-J events, 11 out of 362, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We have also checked that G-J emission events are quasi-uniformly distributed across the 26-year interval studied, and that their distribution shows no clustering versus Φ Io , which might have been due to misidentification of a small fraction of I-J events as non-Io events, whose clustering versus Φ Ga would result from the 1:4 orbital resonance of Ganymede with Io.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Energetics (intensity, duration and power) of Io, non-Io, and Ganymede radio emissions</head><p>Comparison of the energetics of I-J, G-J, and non-Io emissions is based on the distributions of intensities and durations of these emissions. Both quantities vary with the observer-Jupiter distance R. The intensity varies in 1/R 2 , with R varying between 3.95 and 6.45 AU (5.2 AU on average) over the ∼13-month synodic period of the Earth-Jupiter system. The intensity of each emission event can be normalized to the average distance of 5.2</p><p>Article number, page 3 of 9</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. 33586corrbib   similar. The G-J distribution contains far fewer events (see. Table 1), and is slightly shifted toward lower intensities. In order to quantitatively assess the difference between the G-J and the I-J or non-Io distributions, the distribution of G-J emission intensities was shifted by intervals of 0.5 dB, and for each shift the resulting distribution was divided bin-to-bin by the I-J or non-Io distributions. We found that for a shift of +0.5 dB, the obtained ratios are flat curves with an average value of 1/7.8, demonstrating that G-J radio emissions are ∼7.8 times less frequent but only 0.5 dB weaker on average than I-J and non-Io emissions. It is less straightforward to quantitatively compare the distributions of I-J, G-J, and non-Io emissions durations because the corresponding histograms have different shapes (widths). The event duration depends on the detection threshold above the galactic and instrumental backgrounds combined with the intensity variation of the Jovian emissions, which itself depends on the distance R. As a first step, we attempt to correct the measured event durations for this bias. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the distribution of the durations of all emissions in our 26-year database, from which we derive a linear approximation of the variation of the average emission duration &lt; D &gt; as a function of R: &lt; D &gt; (min.) = 43.2 − 7.6 × (R − 5.2AU).</p><p>(1) We can use it to correct the duration of each emission event to first order by computing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D cor = D + 7.6 × (R − 5.2AU),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with D and D cor in minutes. We finally obtain in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4b</ref> the statistical distribution of event durations normalized to the average distance of 5.2 AU. All of the following plots and discussions refer to these corrected durations only.</p><p>To compare the normalized distributions (i.e. with an histogram maximum=1) of I-J, non-Io, and G-J event durations of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4b</ref>, the question is to find which factor to apply to the G-J event durations distribution to match the I-J or non-Io ones. A simple ratio of the histograms will not provide the correct answer. We have therefore scaled G-J event durations by a factor α (with 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 2.0 in steps of 0.1). For each value of α, the duration of every G-J event is multiplied by α before building the normalized histogram of G-J event durations (in black in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). The bin-to-bin ratio of this rescaled histogram with the histograms of I-J (dashed red) and non-Io (dotted blue) event durations is computed over the range 20-180 min, that is, between the peak of the histograms and the abscissa at which the number of events per ten-minute bin becomes ≤2. This ratio is plotted as the thin solid red line for the α(G-J)/(I-J) event durations ratio, and as the thin solid blue line for the α(G-J)/(non-Io) event durations ratio. It is fitted with straight lines (in lin-log scale) whose slopes are indicated with the same colour code at the top of the plots. When α varies from 0.5 to 2.0, the slopes regularly increase (the straight line fits turn counterclockwise).

Using the measured parameter values from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 21</ref>.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kivelson et al.

The observed ratio between the I-J and G-J radio powers, found to be ∼15 above, is therefore consistent with the ratio of the magnetic energy (Poynting) fluxes intercepted by Io and Ganymede. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> displays the radio-kinetic (a) and radio-magnetic (b) scaling laws derived from planetary magnetospheric auroral emissions in the solar system (black dots). For planetary magnetospheres, the incident energy fluxes come from the solar wind and are intercepted by the magnetosphere's cross-sections. Placing on these diagrams the I-J and G-J measured radio powers versus the intercepted kinetic and magnetic powers by Io and Ganymede computed above, it appears clear that the radiomagnetic scaling law provides a far more consistent paradigm for flow-obstacle interactions leading to non-thermal radio emissions.

The unconstrained best fit is obtained with a slope of 1.15. Satellite-Jupiter points are located slightly above the fitted law, possibly because the sub-Alfvénic Jovian flow is more efficiently tapped for accelerating electrons than the super-Alfvénic solar wind. We note that observations and modelling by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chané et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chané et al. ( , 2015</ref> showed that the interaction between solar wind and Earth can become temporarily sub-Alfvénic, with disappearance of the bow shock, apparition of Alfvén wings in the solar wind supported by the Earth's magnetopause -very similar to Ganymede's Alfvén wings in the Jovian magnetosphere -, and reduction of auroral currents. <ref type="figure">Figure 7c</ref> shows the extrapolation of the two fits of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7b</ref> to the range of Poynting flux intercepted by hot Jupiters, which would lead to radio emissions up to 10 7 times stronger than Jupiter's, intense enough to be detectable with UTR-2, LOFAR, and SKA from exoplanetary systems at distances of several tens of parsecs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zarka 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zarka et al. 2015</ref>). One possible drawback would be the existence of a saturation of the radio-magnetic scaling law, but at least one documented case exists of a magnetic binary star (V711τ) where observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budding et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Richards et al. 2003</ref>) allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mottez &amp; Zarka (2014)</ref> to estimate P radio ∼ 7×10 19−20 W and P mag ∼ 7×10 21 −6×10 24 W. The corresponding point falls close to the radio-magnetic scaling law of slope 1, at powers &gt; 10 10 times larger than in the solar system, suggesting that saturation is not a critical issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Based on the recent 26-year database of Jupiter observations with the Nançay decameter array built by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marques et al. (2017a)</ref>, the prominent I-J component was revisited <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figs. 1a and 3a, c)</ref> and the G-J component was detected unambiguously <ref type="bibr">(Figs. 1b and 3b, d, and Zarka et al. 2017</ref>). More than 350 G-J emission events were detected in the interval 1990-2015 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, making it possible to statistically characterise their duration, intensity, and, therefore, energetics (average power), and compare them to those of I-J emission events.</p><p>We have found that G-J emissions have typical intensities only ∼0.5 dB lower than I-J or non-Io emissions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a)</ref>. This suggests that CMI operates at relatively uniform efficiency around Jupiter, where the various radio components are produced, whatever the origin of the accelerated electrons, leading to similar intensity distributions for all radio components. However, the temporal behaviours of G-J and I-J emissions are very different.</p><p>G-J emissions are much (7.8 times) less frequent than I-J emissions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a)</ref>, and have a typical duration ∼1.25 times longer than that of non-Io (auroral) emissions, but ∼1.7 times shorter than that of I-J emissions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4b)</ref>. These properties can shed light on the physics of the interaction of Ganymede and Jupiter via magnetic reconnection. Non-Io emission events are believed to be associated with "hot spots" (localized precipitations) along Jupiter's main auroral oval ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bagenal et al. 2017)</ref>. As CMI emission is strongly anisotropic (beamed in a hollow conical sheet widely open around the magnetic field within the source), Jupiter's rotation carries the beam out of the observer's view in a few tens of minutes. I-J emission being tied to Io's flux tube, the radio beam moves with Io's orbital motion, four times slower than Jupiter's rotation, which explains a duration of I-J events much longer than non-Io ones, assuming that the I-J emission is produced in a quasi-permanent way ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Louis et al. 2017b</ref>). If the G-J radio emission was permanent, emission events would last even longer due to the slower orbital motion of Ganymede ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Louis et al. 2017a</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4b</ref> shows that this is not the case, and that G-J emission events are likely controlled by Jupiter's rotation. We propose that the G-J interaction via reconnection is governed by a substorm-like regime of storage and sporadic release of energy controlled by Jupiter's rotation, in contrast with an I-J interaction governed by more steady excitation of Alfvén waves. Such waves are also likely produced in the wake of Ganymede, following the last reconnection of Jovian magnetic field lines with Ganymede's magnetosphere, but they do not seem to generate detectable emissions comparable to (and longer than) I-J ones.</p><p>Our main result is that Ganymede-and Io-induced radio powers are in the same ratio as the magnetic power input that they intercept from the magnetosphere, in spite of the different interactions of these moons with Jupiter's magnetosphere (primarily via Alfvén waves for Io and magnetic reconnection for Ganymede). Auroral, Io-induced, and Ganymede-induced radio emissions are all found to fit a radio-magnetic scaling law. Quantitative inclusion of G-J and I-J radio emissions strongly grounds this scaling law, the extrapolation of which allows us to predict strong -potentially detectable -radio emissions from hot Jupiters.</p><p>Recent theoretical works <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Nichols 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Saur et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nichols &amp; Milan 2016</ref>) that examined specific cases of flowobstacle magnetic interaction generally agree with the radiomagnetic law, although their quantitative predictions for exoplanets may differ by one order of magnitude for giant planets, and up to two for Earth-like planets, over a total range ≥10 orders of magnitude covered by the scaling law. Figures 7b, c characterise average powers for planets orbiting a solar-type star (i.e. with a solar-like magnetic field of ∼1 Gauss). Stronger stellar magnetic fields should lead to stronger radio emissions. Intrinsic variability of radio emission is also superimposed on the average behaviour of <ref type="figure">Fig. 7b</ref>, c and may lead to stronger radio bursts. Radio scintillation can temporarily further increase the received flux density by &gt;1 order of magnitude. Overall, detectable emissions levels should exist for at least a fraction of the known hot Jupiters, provided that high enough frequencies are emitted (above a few 10's MHz). Very favourable targets are hot Jupiters orbiting stars more strongly magnetized than the Sun, where radio emission can be excited by the planet interaction with the star's magnetic field in a giant analogue of the I-J or G-J systems (and for which the predicted radio power is also increased). This suggests that radio detection of exoplanets should occur soon provided that enough hot Jupiter targets are monitored, which will be the case with the deep surveys of LOFAR (ongoing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shimwell et al. 2017</ref>) and SKA (in preparation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zarka et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>.</head><label></label><figDesc>Circular polarization sense (right-hand or left-hand) and time-frequency shape of the emission are spe- cific for each region (Marques et al. 2017a).
