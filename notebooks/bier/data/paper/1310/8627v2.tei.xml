				<p>We show that the first order (non co-orbital) corotation torques are significantly modified by entropy gradients in a non-barotropic protoplanetary disk. Such non-barotropic torques can dramatically alter the balance that, for barotropic cases, results in the net eccentricity damping for giant gap-clearing planets embedded in the disk. We demonstrate that stellar illumination can heat the gap enough for the planet&apos;s orbital eccentricity to instead be excited. We also discuss the &quot;Eccentricity Valley&quot; noted in the known exoplanet population, where low-metallicity stars have a deficit of eccentric planets between ∼ 0.1 and ∼ 1 AU compared to metal-rich systems (Dawson &amp; Murray-Clay 2013). We show that this feature in the planet distribution may be due to the self-shadowing of the disk by a rim located at the dust sublimation radius ∼ 0.1 AU, which is known to exist for several T Tauri systems. In the shadowed region between ∼ 0.1 and ∼ 1 AU lack of gap insolation allows disk interactions to damp eccentricity. Outside such shadowed regions stellar illumination can heat the planetary gaps and drive eccentricity growth for giant planets. We suggest that the self-shadowing does not arise at higher metallicity due to the increased optical depth of the gas interior to the dust sublimation radius.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The rapid pace of extrasolar planet discovery in recent years has provided detailed statistical data about the distribution of planets in our Galaxy. One of the many surprises in these data is the large number of planets with significant eccentricity measured through the radial velocity (RV) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butler et al. 2006</ref>), particularly in those planets orbiting beyond ∼ 0.1 AU, where tidal damping is inefficient. In contrast, the planets in our own Solar System (aside from Mercury) have low-eccentricity orbits. While eccentricity has been primarily measured through RV, eccentricity can also be inferred for the many exoplanets discovered through the transit method by utilizing transit timing variations (TTVs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lithwick et al. 2012</ref>) and through the so-called 'photoeccentric effect' on the transit lightcurve <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dawson &amp; Johnson 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kane et al. (2012)</ref> recently showed through a comparison of orbital and transit timescales that the statistical eccentricity distribution of the planets detected by the Kepler spacecraft may be similar to the distributions of those that have direct RV measurements of their eccentricity, however <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Plavchan et al. (2012)</ref> point out that this depends on the uncertain stellar radii given for the Kepler sample, particularly for smaller stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kane et al. (2012)</ref> also showed that the mean eccentricity of Kepler planet candidates increases with increasing planet size plateauing above Neptune-sized planets (R p &gt; ∼ 4R ⊕ ).</p><p>The planets are thought to have migrated into their dtsang@physics.mcgill.ca present orbits. Migration processes fall into two broad classes, planet-disk interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980)</ref>, where planets migrate smoothly through the disk; and few-body interactions, where planets are moved inwards through interaction with perturbing or scattering bodies (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lin &amp; Ida 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Naoz et al. 2011</ref>). Multi-body dynamical processes have been studied intensely, in part to explain the presence of hot Jupiter systems that were found by early RV observations. However, nearly a third of the likely planet candidates found by the Kepler observatory are thought to be in co-planar multi-planet systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>), indicating that their evolution was likely dominated by disk interaction. The results of disk migration also provide the initial conditions of the planet locations and eccentricity distribution for the multi-body interactions that take place after the disk has dissipated. Given an initial distribution of sufficiently non-zero eccentricities (e &gt; ∼ 0.1), <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref> showed that dynamical relaxation of the planetary systems could explain the eccentricity distribution of higher eccentricity systems. Migration driven by planet-disk interactions has been investigated as a means to excite eccentricity in migrating planets. Disk resonances exchange both energy and angular momentum between a planet and the disk, modifying the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of the planet. Certain resonances tend to pump eccentricity, while others tend to damp it. It is generally thought that the net effect of disk-planet interactions is to damp eccentricity. For small planets, this is almost certainly the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Artymowicz 1993)</ref>. For giant planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldreich &amp; Sari (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ogilvie &amp; Lubow (2003)</ref> suggested that saturation of the eccentricity-damping first-order corotation resonances could lead to eccentricity growth of planets able to clear a gap in the disk. However, recent numerical studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dunhill et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bitsch et al. 2013a</ref>) have not seen such saturation in simulations, finding that eccentricity is damped for giant planets except for extreme cases where the gap is wide enough to avoid the corotation resonances entirely.</p><p>Entropy gradients in the disk can modify corotation resonances through baroclinic effects. Previous studies on the effects of entropy gradients in non-barotropic disks have focussed on the primary (co-orbital) co-rotation resonance, numerically solving for the response of the disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baruteau &amp; Masset 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Paardekooper &amp; Papaloizou 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Paardekooper et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Paardekooper et al. , 2011</ref>, and the effect of the non-barotropic non-linear horseshoe torques on Type I migration of small planets embedded in the protoplanetary disk. These non-barotropic effects can allow halting or even reversal of migration for certain systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bitsch et al. (2013b)</ref> recently utilized the numerical fitting formulae from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Paardekooper et al. (2011)</ref> to predict the effect of stellar illumination on migration of small embedded planets.</p><p>In a companion paper (Tsang 2013), we go beyond these previous studies by deriving a fully analytic form for the linear non-barotropic corotation torques, for both primary and first-order corotation resonances. Here, we apply these results to eccentricity excitation in disks in which the gap formed by a migrating planet is heated by stellar irradiation. The general picture is as follows. As a gap clearing planet perturbs the disk, Lindblad resonances excite the planet's eccentricity while non coorbital corotation torques damp its eccentricity. In a barotropic disk, the damping dominates unless the gap is very large. We show here that the entropy gradients at the edge of an irradiated gap act to reduce the nonbarotropic corotation torque, allowing the eccentricityexciting Lindblad resonances to dominate. The requirement for the gap to be irradiated in order to enable eccentricity growth in the disk offers a potential explanation for the lack of eccentric planets at intermediate orbital periods around low metallicity stars found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Dawson &amp; Murray-Clay (2013)</ref>. In low metallicity disks, heating of the disk at the dust sublimation radius may lead to shadowing of the disk in the region ∼ 0.1-1 AU <ref type="bibr">(Dulle- mond et al. 2001)</ref>, causing eccentricity damping in this "Eccentricity Valley" region.</p><p>An outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the nature of non-barotropic corotation torques and their dependence on background entropy gradient. In Section 3 we review the mechanism of eccentricity damping for giant planets in barotropic disks. In Section 4 we show that for reasonable assumptions about the disk structure and insolation the resulting non-barotropic torques can lead to eccentricity excitation. In Section 5, we demonstrate how the "Eccentricity Valley" may be explained by eccentricity damping and excitation in selfshadowed and fully irradiated disks respectively. Finally we discuss the implication of our results in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">COROTATION TORQUES IN</head><p>NON-BAROTROPIC DISKS 2.1. The Vortensity Equation A quantity that plays an important role in the determination of the corotation torque is the vortensity, ζ ≡ ω z /Σ, (also known as the potential or specific vorticity) where ω z = ˆ z · ( × u) is the z-component of a fluid's vorticity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1979)</ref> showed that the torque associated with the corotation resonance has the sign of the radial vortensity gradient in the disk. For disks with orbital angular velocity Ω(r), ζ can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ζ = κ 2 2ΩΣ = 2B Σ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where κ 2 ≡ (2Ω/r)d(r 2 Ω)/dr is the square of the radial epicyclic frequency, B = κ 2 /(4Ω) is the local Oort constant, and Σ is the disk surface density. The continuity equation and the curl of the momentum equation for ideal fluids can be combined to obtain the Lagrangian (co-moving) time derivative for vortensity (the vorticity equation, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lovelace et al. 1999</ref>),</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D Dt ζ = ˆ z · Σ × P Σ 3 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The right hand side of the equation above is the baroclinic term, which contributes when the lines of constant (surface) density Σ and (vertically integrated) pressure P are not parallel in a fluid. In most previous works studying eccentricity evolution due to disk-planet interaction, the disk is assumed to be barotropic, such that pressure is only a function of density, P = P (Σ). This causes the lines of constant P and Σ to be parallel for any perturbations, such that the baroclinic term is zero. Thus for barotropic disks, the vortensity is conserved for all perturbations.</p><p>In a non-barotropic disk, where entropy gradients exist, the baroclinic term is non-zero. For an ideal gas with adiabatic index γ where S ≡ P/Σ γ , we can write Equation (2) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D Dt ζ = ˆ z · Σ × S Σ 3−γ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>which shows that density perturbations may generate vortensity in the presence of an entropy gradient.</p><p>2.2. Disk Resonances A planet orbiting with non-zero eccentricity has a time varying gravitational potential which can be split into the Fourier components</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Φ p (r) = l,m Φ l,m cos[m(φ + Ω l,m t)],<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where mΩ l,m = mΩ p +(l −m)κ p is the pattern frequency for the (l, m) component, and Ω p and κ p are the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of the planet. Only the l = m (primary) and l = m ± 1 (first-order), components are non-zero to first order in eccentricity. At Lindblad resonances, where the pattern frequency of the gravitational perturbation in the frame co-moving with the disk material is equal to the local epicyclic frequency (m(Ω l,m − Ω) = ±κ), the disk material is able to respond strongly to such perturbations and waves are launched, resulting in Lindblad torques.</p><p>At a corotation resonance, the disk material moves with the same speed as the pattern speed for a particular potential component. The primary corotation resonances (where Ω(r) = Ω m,m = Ω p ) are located at the same orbital radius as the planet, while the first-order corotation resonances (where Ω(r) = Ω m±1,m = Ω p ± κ/m) are located both interior and exterior to the orbit of the planet (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). In the remainder of this paper we will use the terms "first-order corotation resonance" and "non co-orbital corotation resonance" interchangeably.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The Corotation Torque</head><p>A full calculation of the linear non-barotropic corotation torque must also consider the disk enthalpy response to the perturbing potential. This has been previously studied for co-orbital (primary) corotation resonances by numerically calculating this response ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baruteau &amp; Masset 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Paardekooper &amp; Papaloizou 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Paardekooper et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Paardekooper et al. , 2011</ref>). In the companion paper to this work, Tsang (2013), we employ an approach similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhang &amp; Lai (2006)</ref> to derive a fully analytic form for the linear non-barotropic corotation torque for both primary and first-order corotation resonances.</p><p>While the full expression from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tsang (2013)</ref> should be used to evaluate such torques in the general case, for the purposes of this discussion we will adopt the simplifying limit of a cold ideal gas disk, such that the adiabatic sound speed, c 2 s ≡ γP/Σ r 2 Ω 2 , is small compared to the orbital velocity (such that the disk scale height, h/r ≡ c s /rΩ 1, is small). We allow the disk to have entropy gradients such that there can be a non-zero radial Brunt-Väisäla frequency, N r , defined to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">N 2 r ≡ − 1 γΣ dP dr d ln S dr .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>For simplicity we also assume that N 2 r &gt; 0 such that the disk is stably stratified radially, though this may not be the case for some disks, particularly those where the baroclinic instability only occurs slowly <ref type="bibr">(Lesur &amp; Pa- paloizou 2010)</ref>, or where magnetic fields have prevented instability from occurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lyra &amp; Klahr 2011</ref>).

The location of the corotation (rc), inner Lindblad (r ILR ) and outer Lindblad (r OLR ) resonances are shown relative to the gap-clearing planet for the Φ l,m primary (l = m) and first order (l = m ± 1) potential components. Also shown are the dominant contributions to the eccentricity evolution assuming a cleared gap. The eccentricity damping by the non co-orbital corotation torques tends to slightly dominate (by ∼ 5%) the eccentricity pumping by the first-order external Lindblad resonances <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003)</ref> leading to a net eccentricity damping by the disk-planet interaction. and r c is the radial location of the corotation resonance.</p><p>The sign of the corotation torque for a cold disk is thus controlled by the combination of the radial gradients of the vortensity and the disk entropy. In the limit where N 2 r → 0 and S → constant, we recover the original expression for barotropic the corotation torque from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine (1979)</ref> (see their eq. <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>), where the sign of the torque depends only on the gradient of the vortensity. Note that if the characteristic timescale of energy transport in the disk is shorter than the perturbation (orbital) timescale, then the perturbations cannot be treated as adiabatic, but will be isothermal, and the barotropic torque will also be recovered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Understanding the Sign of the Corotation Torque</head><p>The nature of the corotation torque can be understood qualitatively by considering the effect of the potential components on collisionless particles near the corotation point <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003)</ref>. Just interior to the corotation resonance a particle feels a more slowly moving potential which slows it down and moves it towards the corotation radius. Just outside the corotation a particle feels a more quickly moving potential, which speeds it up and moves it towards corotation. There is therefore a net particle flux towards the corotation, with the particle starting interior to the corotation gaining angular momentum and those starting exterior to the corotation losing it. The net torque on disk (and conversely on the planet) then depends on the relative flux of material into corotation from either side.</p><p>For barotropic perturbations the vortensity is conserved by Equation (2), such that the vortensity is carried with fluid elements regardless of the torques exerted by the planet.

Also shown are the dominant contributions to the eccentricity evolution assuming a cleared gap. The presence of an entropy gradient at the non co-orbital (first order) corotation resonances can cause a reduction (or even a reversal) of the corotation torque compared to the barotropic case (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>, allowing the first-order external Lindblad resonances to dominate and thus a net eccentricity excitation by the disk-planet interaction.</p><p>tion the relative flux towards the corotation from either side must scale with the background vortensity gradient dζ/dr, and thus the net torque at a corotation resonance must be proportional to this value for barotropic disks.</p><p>However, for disks where an entropy gradient exists, such density and pressure perturbations can generate vortensity.

In particular for extremely large planets where a very large gap has been cleared, such that no material is present to interact at the non co-orbital corotation resonances, eccentricity growth driven by the first-order Lindblad resonances is seen <ref type="bibr">(Pa- paloizou et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kley &amp; Dirksen 2006</ref>) 3 .</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dunhill et al.

All three of these works treat radiative transfer in an axisymmetric model disk. In the latter two, the hydrostatic vertical structure is also iterated to consistency with the radiation field. If the disk has a flaring shape and the gap is optically-thin, the star directly illuminates and heats a strip of material along the top of the gap's outer edge. The outer edge in turn emits infrared photons, some of which travel down into the gap, lifting temperatures there above the equilibrium levels found with no gap.

However as we now show, in the case of a heated gap χ can be significantly lower than 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldreich &amp; Sari (2003)</ref> estimated that in a barotropic disk the eccentricity damping by the non co-orbital corotation torques exceeds the eccentricity pumping by firstorder Lindblad torques by ∼ 5%. The Lindblad resonances are not significantly affected by the presence of entropy gradients as their locations are only perturbed slightly so that the perturbation frequency in the comoving frame, m(Ω l,m − Ω) = ± κ 2 + N 2 r , matches the epicyclic frequency modified to include the effect of the radial buoyancy. If we take χ crit ∼ 0.95 to be the corotation torque reduction factor necessary to allow eccentricity driving by the Lindblad resonances to win, then we arrive at the condition for eccentricity driving by the disk,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">d ln T /dr d ln Σ/dr &lt; γ χ crit − 1.<label>(16)</label></formula><p>When the radial temperature scale height is much larger than the radial density scale height (|d ln T /dr/d ln Σ/dr| | 1), as is the case in the almost isothermal heated gap, we expect a reduction in the torque by a factor of χ ≈ 1/γ. An even smaller torque can result when the temperature gradient is of the opposite sign to the density gradient (if there is a strong temperature inversion going into the gap). This result assumes that there is sufficient thermal diffusion to prevent the torque from thermally saturating. This is discussed further in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tsang (2013)</ref>, where it is shown that the dimensionless diffusivity required at the location of the first-order corotation resonances is small. The minimum dimensionless diffusivity required to maintain linearity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">D e ≡ K ρC p r 2 c Ω 2 &gt; 10 −7 e 10 −2 M p /M 10 −3 3/2 ,<label>(17)</label></formula><p>for the model gap width and location used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Turner et al. (2012)</ref>, where K is the thermal conductivity, C p is the specific heat at constant pressure, ρ is the volume density, and all quantities are evaluated at the resonance location. If the diffusivity is too small, then the gradient of the entropy perturbation becomes comparable to the background entropy gradient, and the torque thermally saturates, returning to its barotropic value. The minimum thermal diffusivity D e is exceeded by several orders of magnitude near the gap we consider here.</p><p>To show a specific example, we have plotted the logarithmic derivative ratio for the gap models discussed in §4.1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, where we see that the insolation into the gap heated it enough to provide χ &lt; ∼ 0.75 at the gap edge. In fact, the heating of the gap has reduced the (d ln T /dr)/(d ln Σ/dr) term in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> so much that the value of χ is close to χ ≈ 1/γ = 0.71. This level of gap heating can be achieved for systems where the gap width and disk flaring angle allow the stellar luminosity absorbed by the outer edge of the gap to be at least comparable to the heating due to accretion. Thus we expect that many giant planets experience eccentricity excitation by the disk when they are relatively close to the star and have their gaps exposed to insolation, in contrast to the results of previous barotropic simulations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dunhill et al. 2013</ref>). If the light from the central star is blocked, or the angle of incident starlight is sufficiently small (in, for example, a disk where the dust has significantly settled), then the entropy gradients will be much less steep, and the corotation torque should be closer to the barotropic level for which the planets will experience eccentricity damping due to the disk.</p><p>The gaps involved must be sufficiently clean to suppress the damping of eccentricity by the co-orbital Lindblad resonances. Defining C CR , C eLR and C cLR to be the relative strengths of the non co-orbital corotation, external Lindblad, and co-orbital Lindblad resonances respectively (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003)</ref>, we have C eLR /C cLR 1/3 (Artymowicz 1993). Assuming a ∼ 5% net eccentricity driving from the external Lindblad and corotation resonances, such that C eLR − C CR 0.05C eLR , material in the gap will lead to eccentricity damping unless the gap is sufficiently clear Σ gap /Σ disk &lt; ∼ (C eLR − C CR )/C cLR 1/60.</p><p>It should be noted that the final value of a planet's eccentricity cannot be determined through the linear analyses described above if the planet experiences eccentricity driving through the disk. Non-linear effects quickly become important as the eccentricity grows large and the planet nears the gap edge. However we note that even in barotropic simulations, once very wide gaps made the first-order corotation torques ineffective, the eccentricity quickly reached large values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Papaloizou et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kley &amp; Dirksen 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dunhill et al. 2013</ref>). Also, we assumed the disk is more massive than the planet. Movement of material within the disk could limit the planet's final eccentricity in cases where disk and planet masses are comparable.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have shown that entropy gradients and a nonbarotropic equation of state modify the non co-orbital corotation torques for planets embedded in their natal disks. We have provided a simplified form for the torque valid in the limit of a cold disk, with N 2 r Ω 2 . A more general analytic formula for the corotation torque is provided in a companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Tsang 2013)</ref>. If starlight heats the gap around a giant planet enough to satisfy Equation (16), then the corotation torques are reduced to the point where the planet's eccentricity is excited rather than damped. This threshold is reached if enough of the stellar luminosity is absorbed on the gap's outer rim. We have shown that the threshold is easily exceeded in the flared structure obtained for a standard viscous disk model by placing the material surrounding the gap in radiative balance with the starlight. Our starlight transfer calculations are axisymmetric and thus do not include the planet's wakes, but do capture the gross shape of the disk surface under vertical hydrostatic balance. Thus we expect that starlight heating could have enabled many planets to gain eccentricity through disk interaction, rather than solely through later postdisk dynamical interactions as previously thought. Note that eccentricity driving requires the gap around the giant planet to be sufficiently cleared that the co-orbital Lindblad torques are suppressed, since these would dominate the eccentricity evolution for an embedded planet (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldreich &amp; Sari 2003</ref>, for further discussion).</p><p>The eccentricity driving has important implications for the inferred dynamical histories of giant planets in the currently known RV sample, and for the relative importance of orbital evolution due to the disk versus strong dynamical interactions, such as planet-planet scattering or the Kozai mechanism. Such disk interactions may be the source of the isolated eccentric giant planets. For the Kepler sample, the inferred mean eccentricity dependence on the planet size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kane et al. 2012</ref>), rising with R p and plateauing above 4R ⊕ , may be consistent with an eccentricity growth process being tied to gap clearing conditions. The eccentricity distribution at the end of the protoplanetary disk phase also provides the initial conditions for multi-planet interactions as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref>, and further may help to explain the excess of planets with low, but non-zero eccentricity that are not explained by these interactions.</p><p>We have suggested that the "Eccentricity Valley" for planets between ∼ 0.1 and ∼ 1 AU around lowmetallicity host stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dawson &amp; Murray-Clay 2013)</ref> may be explained by noting that this range also corresponds to the region shadowed by the dust rim that is formed when an optically thin gas interior to the dust sublimation point allows direct insolation of the dust wall at the sublimation radius. In the self-shadowed region between ∼ 0.1 and 1 AU the disk interactions should damp eccentricity, resulting in circular orbits. For higher metallicities, and higher accretion rates, the flow interior to the dust sublimation radius can become optically thick, preventing direct insolation from puffing up the dust rim, and causing the shadowed region to disappear. Such fully-illuminated disks may produce eccentric planets in the "Eccentricity Valley" region, as is seen for systems with [Fe/H] &gt; 0. One might expect the extent of the shadowed region to decrease smoothly with increasing metallicity, as the height of the disk rim varies. Intriguingly, a hint of this may be present in the lower envelope of the planet distribution shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>We have only studied the linear growth of eccentricity in a system with a heated gap. To fully understand the eccentricity evolution of planetary systems and follow the eccentricity growth into the non-linear regime, detailed numerical simulations are needed that include non-barotropic equations of state and the effect of stellar illumination on the gap. Additional modeling of the dust rim and the shadowed region of protoplanetary disks, and the geometric effects of a planetary gap in these regions is also needed to confirm if the "Eccentricity Valley" arises due to self-shadowing and non-barotropic torques in fully-illuminated disks.</p><p>Note that accretion heating is neglected in the two radiative transfer and hydrostatic balance calculations shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, as is shock heating associated with the planet's wake. Starlight will modify the corotation torques only when the gap is heated by illumination at least as much as the gap edges are heated by accretion and shocks. This would depend on the accretion rate at the end of the disk phase, and the gap opening dynamics and resulting structure. It will also be important to study the expected entropy gradients in disks that are not irradiated or in regions of irradiated disks in which accretion heating dominates.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Schematic illustration for eccentricity damping by diskplanet interactions in a gap for a barotropic (or isentropic) disk.
