			<abstract>
				<p>We present an optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b, based on HST observations, covering the spectral regime from 0.29 to 1.027Âµm with STIS, which is coupled with a recent WFC3 transit (1.087 to 1.687Âµm). We derive refined physical parameters of the HAT-P-1 system, including an improved orbital ephemeris. The transmission spectrum shows a strong absorption signature shortward of 0.55Âµm, with a strong blueward slope into the near-ultraviolet. We detect atmospheric sodium absorption at a 3.3Ï significance level, but find no evidence for the potassium feature. The red data implies a marginally flat spectrum with a tentative absorption enhancement at wavelength longer than â¼ 0.85Âµm. The STIS and WFC3 spectra differ significantly in absolute radius level (4.3 Â± 1.6 pressure scale heights), implying strong optical absorption in the atmosphere of HAT-P-1b. The optical to near-infrared difference cannot be explained by stellar activity, as simultaneous stellar activity monitoring of the G0V HAT-P-1b host star and its identical companion show no significant activity that could explain the result. We compare the complete STIS and WFC3 transmission spectrum with theoretical atmospheric models which include haze, sodium and an extra optical absorber. We find that both an optical absorber and a super-solar sodium to water abundance ratio might be a scenario explaining the HAT-P-1b observations. Our results suggest that strong optical absorbers may be a dominant atmospheric feature in some hot Jupiter exoplanets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the first detection of an exoplanet hosted by a Sunlike star <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>, the number of extraso-â E-mail: nikolay@astro.ex.ac.uk <ref type="bibr">(NN)</ref> lar planets and candidates has rapidly grown, yet exceeding more than 3000. Among them, the planets that temporarily pass in front (transit) or behind (secondary eclipse) the host star offer a unique opportunity to explore their dynamical properties, internal structures and atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Winn 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Seager 2011</ref>). Specifically, during transits part of the star light travels through the rarified upper planetary atmosphere (near the terminator) and is partially absorbed by atoms and molecules. This process gives rise to a wavelength dependent variation of the measured transit depth and is central to the method of transmission spectroscopy, the subject of this paper. The optical transmission spectrum of a cloud free hot Jupiter exoplanet at temperatures lower than 1500 K is predicted to be dominated by pressure broadened sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) resonance lines ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Seager &amp; Sasselov 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, observations have led to mixed detections of both strong alkali features in several exoplanets with HD 209458b and HD 189733b remaining among the two most studied exoplanets, due to the prominent brightness of their host stars (V â¼ 8 mag) and deep transit signals. In particular, the optical transmission spectrum of HD 209458b shows broad sodium feature and a lack of potassium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Charbonneau et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sing et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Snellen et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Narita et al. 2005</ref>). The complete optical to near-infrared spectrum of HD 189733b is described by an increasing planetary radius with decreasing wavelength, most likely due to Rayleigh scattering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sing et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sing et al. , 2011b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2008</ref>) and presence of narrow line cores of sodium peaking above the slope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Redfield et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huitson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jensen et al. 2012</ref>). Although there is no reason to expect that these two atmospheres should be similar, as infrared observations indicate that the atmosphere of HD 209458b has a temperature inversion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>) while the atmosphere of HD 189733b does not ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Grillmair et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Charbonneau et al. 2008</ref>), the significant difference between both planetary atmospheres indicates that clouds and hazes can be very important in determining the overall shape of transmission spectra. In addition to HD 209458b and HD 189733b, a sodium core has also been detected in WASP-17b but with an absorption depth much less than the theoretical prediction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wood et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhou &amp; Bayliss 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wood et al. (2011)</ref> speculate that the depleted sodium abundance could be due to photoionization. Notably, XO-2b is the first exoplanet for which both sodium and potassium absorption was detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Sing et al. 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sing et al. , 2012</ref>. Unlike HD 189733b, this planet shows no evidence for high-altitude clouds or hazes.</p><p>Motivated by the recent observational results and theoretical predictions of strong alkali absorption features, stratosphere inducing TiO and sulphur bearing molecular features, near-infrared molecular features, clouds, hazes and dust we initiated an optical to near-infrared spectroscopic survey of eight close-in giant exoplanets across different regimes of planetary temperature (in the range 1080 â 2800 K). The ultimate aim of the programme is to classify the monitored targets based on their atmospheric specificity, i.e. clear/hazy, presence/lack of TiO/alkali and other molecular features. Accumulating a large number of observed planets will open the possibility to measure correlations between atmospheric properties and other parameters such as stellar activity and stellar type. In this paper we report results from three new transit observations of HAT-P-1b with the G430L and G750L gratings of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In addition, we complement our spectroscopic data with the recently reported HST/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 transit of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wakeford et al. (2013)</ref> and investigate the complete optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b with theory of giant exoplanet atmospheres.</p><p>This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the instrument set-up employed for the transit observations and the data reduction. Section 3 describes the data analysis, including a refinement of the system parameters and the construction of the transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b. Finally, we discuss the results and conclude in Sections 4 and 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b</head><p>Detected by the small automated telescopes of the HATNet ground-based transit survey, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2007)</ref> HAT-P-1b is a giant (Rp â¼ 1.2 RJ), low-mean density (Ïp â¼ 0.4 gcm â3 ) transiting extrasolar planet in a visual binary system, composed of two sun-like stars (separated by angular distance of 11 â²â² on the sky, corresponding to a linear distance of â¼ 1500 AU) located more than 450 lightyears away in the northern constellation Lacerta. The host star (HAT-P-1 also known as ADS 16402 A, BD+37 4734, Î± = 22 h 57 m 46.8 s , Î´ = +38 o 40 â² 28 â²â² , J2000.0) is a moderately bright G0V dwarf (V = 10.4 mag) allowing for characterisation follow-up studies. Although it has been suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> that HAT-P-1b is too large to be explained by theoretical models of giant exoplanets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Winn et al. (2007)</ref> improved the accuracy of the system parameters of HAT-P-1 and its planet and concluded that the planet radius is in accord with theoretical models of irradiated, coreless, solar-composition giant planets. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnson et al. (2008)</ref> combined Keck I/HIRES 1 and Subaru/HDS 2 optical spectra with photometry, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and measuring a close alignment between the planet's orbital inclination and the rotation axis of the star Î» = 3.7 â¢ Â± 2.1 â¢ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Liu et al. (2008)</ref> reexamined the core mass needed for HAT-P-1 b, compared to the available measurements of its radius at the time and concluded that their inferred core masses are roughly consistent with the stellar metallicity versus core-mass relationship.</p><p>The atmosphere of the planet has also been probed with secondary eclipse observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Todorov et al. (2010)</ref> reported Spitzer/IRAC 3 photometry of HAT-P-1b during two secondary eclipse observations, covering broad-bands at 3.6Âµm, 4.5Âµm, 5.8Âµm and 8Âµm. The authors found bestfits for their results of the secondary eclipse depths using an atmosphere with a modest temperature inversion, intermediate between the archetype inverted atmosphere of HD 209458b and a model without an inversion. Further in their discussion the authors speculated that the best fit for the average dayside temperature of HAT-P-1b is 1500 Â± 100 K. Analysis of the secondary eclipse led the authors to the conclusion that the orbit of HAT-P-1b is close to circular, with a 3Ï limit of |e cos Ï| &lt; 0.002. Recently, <ref type="bibr">BÃ©ky et al. (2013)</ref> reported visible-light HST/STIS relative photometry during two occultations of HAT-P-1b, Wavelength (Ã) <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Typical one-dimensional G430L (blue line) and G750L (red line) spectra of HAT-P-1extracted from our time series. Optical element G430L covers the wavelength range from 2892Ã2892Ã to 5700Ã5700Ã, while G750L spans the range from 5240Ã5240Ã to 10270Ã10270Ã, enabling a construction of the complete optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of extrasolar planets at low-resolution. Note the strong long wavelength fringing beyond â¼ 7000Ã7000Ã in grating G750L (displayed on the lower red spectrum) compared to a fringe-corrected data (displayed in the upper red spectrum shifted by 2 Ã 10 4 counts for clarity). A colour version is available in the online journal.</p><p>allowing them to constrain the geometric albedo of the planet. Comparing two techniques: (i) relative photometry (of HAT-P-1 A with respect to its companion HAT-P-1 B) and (ii) the traditional steps in removing instrumental artefacts from (single target) HST time-series, the authors concluded that the second method introduced a strong bias in the albedo result. The authors estimated a 2Ï upper limit of 0.64 for the geometric albedo of HAT-P-1b between 5770 and 9470Ã9470Ã.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS AND CALIBRATIONS</head><p>We obtained low-resolution optical to near-infrared spectra of HAT-P-1 with the STIS instrument aboard the HST (Proposal ID GO-12473, P.I., D. Sing) during three transits on UT 2012 May 26 and 30 with grating G430L and 2012 September 19 with grating G750L. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> exhibits a summary of our observations. Each visit consisted of five â¼ 96 min orbits, during which data collection was truncated with â¼ 45 min gaps due to Earth occultations. Given the moderate brightness of HAT-P-1 (V = 10.4 mag) the integration time was set to 284 s to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in 43 spectra during each visit. Each of the G430L and G750L optical elements possesses a resolving power of R = 500, which secures a combined wavelength coverage from 2892Ã2892Ã to 10270Ã10270Ã with a small overlap region between them from 5,240Ã240Ã to 5,700Ã700Ã (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Sing et al. (2011a)</ref> the data for this study were collected with a wide 52Ã2 â²â² slit to minimise slit loses. Data acquisition overheads were minimised by reading-out a reduced portion of the CCD with a size of 1024 Ã 128.</p><p>Each of the three visits consisted of five orbits during which nine spectra were collected. Three of the orbits at each visit were scheduled to provide out-of transit measurements to secure a stable baseline flux while two orbits occurred during the transit events. Therefore, when combined the three visits provide an almost complete light curve, needed for an accurate measurement of the system parameters and the planet radius. The data was reduced (bias-, dark-and flat-corrected) using the latest version of the CALSTIS 4 pipeline and the relevant up-to-date calibration frames.</p><p>STIS observations with the G750L grating are prone to significant fringing at wavelengths longward of â¼ 7000Ã7000Ã, which can limit the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the derived spectra ( ). The fringes are caused by interference of multiple reflections between the two surfaces of the thinned, backside-illuminated SITe CCD onboard STIS. Although the fringe pattern may have a negligible effect on transmission spectra, acquired from broad spectral widths (â¼ 1000Ã1000Ã), as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref> in their analysis of HD 209458b, the effect may be significant at smaller band widths and requires a careful treatment of the fringe pattern on each of the G750L science spectra. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> CALSTIS comprises software tools developed for the calibration of STIS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Katsanis &amp; McGrath 1998)</ref>   We corrected the fringe pattern present on each of the G750L science spectra of the time series, using a contemporaneous fringe flat image (FFI) and the recipe of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Goudfrooij &amp; Christensen (1998)</ref>. To summarise, we removed the low order lamp vignetting and normalised the FFI. We then aligned and scaled the infrared fringes to match the fringe pattern of the star spectrum on each of the science spectra. Finally, the stellar spectrum was divided by the shifted flat, to correct for the fringe pattern (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> for a comparison between an original G750L spectrum, exhibiting fringe effect to its defringed version).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cosmic ray correction</head><p>An examination of the spectral time series showed a high number of recorded cosmic ray (CR) events. This is not unusual given the relatively long integration time of 284 s, employed for our study on HAT-P-1b. For comparison, previous studies on transiting exoplanets with STIS in a low-resolution mode, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref> on HD 209458 (V=7.65) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sing et al. (2011b)</ref> on HD 189733 (V = 7.67 mag), used integration times of â¼ 20 s and â¼ 64 s, respectively. The application of such shorter integration times (i.e. factor of â¼ 14 and â¼ 4 for the aforementioned studies compared to ours) on bright target stars serves to secure time series of spectra with a lower number of CR events and good sampling of the resulting light curves. When recorded on time series of two-dimensional spectra, the CRs act to effectively increase (though "artificially") the flux of the targeted star on random locations within a limited area along the spectra, and appear as outlier data points on the light curves originating from the affected wavelength bins. We therefore consider the CRs present in our data as a potential source of light curve systematics and undertook a careful analysis aiming CR identification and correction on the science two-dimensional spectra.</p><p>Initially, we aimed to perform the data analysis utilising the .crg images produced after a CR identification and correction by CALSTIS. However, it was found in the subsequent analysis that for most of the spectra the CR identification was inadequate. In particular, large portions or in several cases complete lines around the central regions of the spectra were found to be marked as affected by CR events lacking a justification when compared to the original spectrum. We therefore developed an alternative customised method to i) perform a more efficient CR identification and ii) to correct the affected regions of the spectra. To identify the CRs on each image, we inspected difference images, constructed from the elements of the time series. First we computed the differences between each image we aimed to correct for CRs and four neighbouring images: two consecutive images obtained before and two after the image we aim to correct. In this process, each of the resulting four difference images were dominated by a three-component signal. The first and the second major components were determined by the CR events specific for the neighbour image itself and the CRs that were present on the image we aim to correct. The third component was a negligible residual of the stellar spectrum due to variations associated with the observed target (e.g. transits or other short-time scale events) and/or instrumental systematics (e.g. temperature variations of the telescope). We eliminated the first component, and dramatically reduced the amplitude of the third, after a computation of the median of the four difference images, which resulted in an image containing the CR events only. The later property of the median-combined image allowed us to identify CRs even at locations quite close to the peak of the stellar point spread function (PSF).</p><p>To identify the pixels affected by CRs on each mediancombined image, we scanned each of the CCD's 128 lines, using a window centred on the pixel we were inspecting. The window had a size of 20 pixels, determined by the typical size of a CR on the detector. We compared the value of the central pixel in the window with the median value of all pixels within the window and flagged central pixels that were found to be 5Ï above the median level (where Ï is the standard deviation of the examined line pixel values). To flag huge regions of the spectra affected by CRs (i.e. regions with size exceeding the window size), we also compared the central pixel values with the median value of the entire line and again flagged pixels that showed values higher than 5Ï above the median level for that line. Next, we used all flagged pixels and computed a nominal PSF profile for each column, using five neighbour columns (ignoring the CR affected pixels in them) before and after the examined column. We then scaled the nominal column to match the one with affected pixels. Finally, all flagged pixels were re-placed with their corresponding values in the scaled profile. Following this procedure we found that the total number of pixels affected by CR events comprise â¼ 5% of the total number of pixels on the science images. In addition, we also substituted all pixels identified by CALSTIS as "bad" with the same procedure.</p></div>

Commencing on UT 2012 May 4 and ending on UT 2012 December 13, the observations spanned a period of 223 days that included the three STIS visits and the WFC3 visit. A series of 300 exposures with integration times of 0.8 s were taken each night with 2 Ã 2 pixel binning 6 . The telescope was slightly defocussed to prevent saturation of the detector and to spread the light across a larger number of pixels and minimise flat fielding errors.</p><p>Standard IRAF 7 /PHOT routines were used to obtain accurate centres and perform aperture photometry for HAT-P-1 and three other bright stars within the RISE camera's 9.2 â² Ã 9.2 â² field of view. The defocussed PSFs typically had full widths at half maximum of 10 â 12 pixels (5.4 â²â² â 6.5 â²â² ), so we adopted a radius of 9 pixels for the photometric aperture. Larger aperture radii were not possible, due to the nearby companion to HAT-P-1 separated by only â¼ 20 pixels (11 â²â² ). The sky contribution was estimated by taking the median pixel count within an annulus centred on each star, with an inner edge radius of 30 pixels and a width of 60 pixels.</p><p>To correct for night-to-night changes in telluric conditions and the instrumental setup, we used the comparison stars to perform differential photometry for HAT-P-1. We experimented with dividing the raw fluxes for HAT-P-1 by different combinations of the comparison stars' raw fluxes. In the end, however, we only used the nearby bright comparison star, as the others were simply too faint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">STIS white light curves</head><p>Spectral extractions were performed in IRAF using the APALL procedure. The photon flux originating from a wavelength range in each spectrum of the time series was summed to produce a light curve for that wavelength bin. Photometric per-point uncertainties were initially derived based on pure photon statistics. Similar to other spectrophotometric studies, we refer to the light curve computed after a summation of the complete wavelength range as "white" light curve.</p><p>An optimum performance of the spectral extraction procedure was secured by a selection of the combination of an aperture size and background subtraction (among various <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Rapid Imaging Search for Exoplanets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Steele et al.

It was found that the smallest scatter was achieved with a 13 pixel wide aperture. A wavelength solution was obtained from the x1d files from CALSTIS. Similar to previous HST/STIS studies on transiting exoplanets, the first orbit of each transit observation (purposely scheduled earlier than each transit event) as well as the first exposure of each orbit were discarded. That data exhibits complex and unique systematics, as it was acquired while the telescope was thermally relaxing into its new pointing position. Following the afore-mentioned data quality constraints, each of the three STIS transit observations resulted in four orbits, each of which containing eight measurements (see the top panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>).</p></div>

(2013)</ref>. The data comprised of four orbits, each containing â¼ 45 min intervals of data collection with an integration time of â¼ 47 sec. Notably, the WFC3 field of view also permitted data sampling of the PSF of star HAT-P-1B, which is the second component of the G0V/G0V visual binary that contains the host of HAT-P-1b. Since HAT-P-1B is low active star, it may serve as a comparison star for relative photometry. The white light curve based on the HST/WFC3 data was also useful in determining the system parameters of HAT-P-1. We therefore include that light curve in the analysis of the STIS data (see the top panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ANALYSIS</head><p>A transit light curve analysis was performed for each visit employing a two-component model fit to the data. The first component is based on the complete analytic transit formula given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>, which in addition to the central transit times (TC) and orbital period (P ), is a function of the orbital inclination (i), normalised planet semi-major axis (a/R * ) and planet to star radius ratio (Rp/R * ). To account for the limb darkening of HAT-P-1 we, employ the four parameter non-linear limb darkening law defined in Claret (2000) given by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(Âµ) I(1) = 1 â 4 n=1 cn(1 â Âµ n/2 )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I(1) is the intensity at the centre of the stellar disk and Âµ = cos Î¸, where Î¸ is the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface and cn, n = 1, 4 are the four limb darkening coefficients. We choose to rely on theoretically derived stellar limb darkening coefficients comparing the data to both 1D and 3D stellar models, rather than to fit for them in the data in order to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit (typically four parameters per grating). Furthermore, this approach also eliminates the well-known wavelength-dependent degeneracy of limb darkening with transit depth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sing et al. 2008a</ref>).   <ref type="bibr">19 (G430L)</ref>. Top panels: Raw light curves normalised to the mean raw flux (originally in electrons). The light curves experience prominent systematics associated with the HST thermal cycle (see text for details); Middle panels: Detrended light curves along with the best-fit transit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002</ref>) superimposed with continuous lines; Lower panels: Observed minus modelled light curve residuals, compared to a null (dashed lines) and a 3Ï level (dotted lines) used to identify outliers. The spectrophotometric data from G430L and G750L are colour coded in blue and red, respectively. A colour version is available in the online version of the journal. Initially, the values for the four limb darkening coefficients were derived from the 1D ATLAS theoretical stellar models of Kurucz 8 , following the procedures described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sing (2010)</ref>. In particular, we obtained theoretical limb darkening coefficients for the closest match to a star with the physical properties of HAT-P-1, i.e. T eff = 6000 K, log g = 4.5 and [Fe/H] = 0.0. Previous analyses on high signal-to-noise transit light curves with limb darkening coefficients derived from 1D model predictions sometimes resulted in poor fits, especially in the ingress and egress phases of the transit, which is characteristic of incorrect limb darkening ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hayek et al. 2012</ref>). The main reason for this issue lies in a generic shortcomings in the structure of 1D model 8 http://kurucz.harvard.edu/ atmospheres compared to more sophisticated 3D stellar atmospheric models. In particular, when compared in the case of the solar atmosphere, 3D models explicitly take into account the effect of convective motions in the surface granulation and reproduce the solar atmosphere with a higher degree of realism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hayek et al. (2012)</ref> employed 3D stellar atmospheric models and computed limb darkening coefficients for HD 209458. Notably, the stellar atmospheric parameters of HAT-P-1 are quite similar (at the 1Ï level) to those of HD 209458 as displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. In particular, both stars are of similar effective temperature, however HD 209458 is 120 K hotter than HAT-P-1. That difference however, is well within the effective temperature uncertainties of both stars, which allows one to adopt the available HD 209458 limb darkening coefficients in the analysis of HAT-P-1. We compare both the 1D and 3D models in the forthcoming analysis sections.</p><p>Previous STIS data analyses showed that the first integration exhibits abnormally low flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Charbonneau et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sing et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pont et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Sing et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huitson et al. 2012</ref>). We attempted to resolve this issue by incorporating an additional 1 s long exposure prior to the 284 s integrations. However, it has been found that skipping the 1 s and the first 284 s integration of each orbit improved the fit by reducing the Ï 2 value. We therefore exclude these two data points from each orbit in the analysis.  The raw STIS light curves exhibit instrumental systematics similar to those described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gilliland et al. (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al. (2001)</ref>. In summary, the major source of the systematics is related with the orbital motion of the telescope. In particular the HST focus is known to experience quite noticeable variations on the spacecraft orbital time scale, which are attributed to thermal contraction/expansion (often referred as the 'breathing effect') of the optical telescope assembly as the telescope warms up during its orbital day and cools down during orbital night <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hasan &amp; Bely 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">Suchkov &amp; Hershey 1998</ref>). We take into account the systematics associated with the telescope temperature variations in the transit light curve analysis using a baseline function, which we multiply to the transit model in flux. Similar to past STIS studies, the main ingredient of the baseline function is a polynomial of fourth degree of the HST orbital phase (Ït). In addition, we find in the light curve analysis that the systematics vary from orbit-toorbit (i.e. dependence with time, t), which is a known effect from previous STIS studies as well as the detector positions of the spectra, as determined by the spectral trace orientation (x, y) obtained from the APPAL task in IRAF and the shift (Ï) of each spectrum of the time series, compared to a reference (i.e. cross correlated typically with the first spectrum). Model selection was further investigated including i) polynomials of degrees higher than fourth-order for the HST orbital phase, and ii) additional terms to the planet orbital phase, spectral shifts and traces. However those models were found statistically unjustified for this particular dataset and hence rejected based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schwarz (1978)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BIC = Ï 2 + k ln n,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where k is the number of free parameters and n is the number of data points. A summary of the model selection analysis is presented in Appendix A1. Systematics correction was also performed following the divide out of transit (divide-oot) method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berta et al. (2012)</ref>, where a template correction is constructed using the data from the out of transit orbits. Although the idea would work well for instruments with strictly repeating systematics (such as data from HST/WFC3) we found that the resulting out of transit light curve root-mean-square for our STIS white or binned light curves is a factor of a few higher than the one from the conventional detrending method (adopted in this work). In addition the timing of the HST exposures is known to change slightly from orbit-to-orbit relative to the HST orbital phase, which makes the systematics associated to each orbit unique. We therefore chose to remove the systematics using a parameterised fit to the data.</p><p>An accurate determination of reliable uncertainties of the system parameters often requires a careful treatment of the photometric uncertainties. Time-correlated or "red" noise is often present in high precision photometry and can influence the final parameter determination. To investigate the noise in our light curves, we applied the time-averaging procedure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pont et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Winn et al. 2009</ref>) and binned light curve residuals in time by n data points. For each light curve we computed the Î²âratio between the rms residual of the binned (ÏN ) and unbinned (Ï1) data. In case that the data is free of red noise it is expected that the binned (in M bins) residuals follow the relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ÏN = Ï1 â N M M â 1 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>However, often in reality ÏN Ï1 by the factor Î². The Î² factor is often used to rescale each photometric uncertainty of a data set. Since our data contains only nine data points for each orbit of the four visits in each light curve, it was a difficult task to obtain reliable estimates of the Î² factor for large bin sizes (N &gt; 15). However, we find Î² â¼ 1.3, 1.2, 1 and 1.4 for the white light curves of visits 7, 8, 20 and the WFC3 white light curve when binning no more than fifteen data points. We determine the best-fit parameters of the twocomponent function to the data using the LevenbergMarquardt least-squares algorithm as implemented in the IDL 9 MPFIT 10 package (Markwardt 2009). The final results for the uncertainties of the fitted parameters were taken from MPFIT after a rescale for any non-unity reduced Ï 2 values.    <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wakeford et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">System parameters and transit ephemeris</head><p>One of the goals of the present study is to derive accurate system parameters of HAT-P-1b including an improved transit ephemeris. To achieve this task, ideally one would use a complete and well-sampled transit observation at wavelengths close to or in the infrared, where the stellar limb darkening is minimised and allows accurate parameters to be determined. In this study we rely on the white light curves to derive system parameters. When combined, these curves span nearly a complete transit, sampled once each 294 s, covering the full optical to near-infrared wavelength rage. While several complete transit light curves have been reported from the ground, we consider the quality of the STIS and WFC3 white light curves as high and the wavelength coverage wide. We therefore, choose to model the four HST visits simultaneously.</p><p>Furthermore, as the orbital inclination (i) and the normalised semimajor axis (a/R * ) should not depend on the observed pass-band, we treat these parameters in our fitting code as single values and fit for all transit mid-times (TC), planet to star radius ratios (Rp/R * ) and the coefficients responsible for the light curve systematics separately for each visit. In addition, we also fit Rp/R * to a common value for the two G430L gratings. At each run, we used the derived three transit mid-times and complemented them with all available transit times reported in the literature (with number of transit times indicated in parenthesis after the authors), namely the transit times reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> (1), Johnson et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2008) (7)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Winn et al. (2008)</ref> (2) and fitted a linear ephemeris of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">TC(E) = T0 + E Ã P,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where TC is the central time at each observation, T0 is the reference transit time, and E and P are the transit epoch and period, respectively. The result for the orbital period was then used as an initial guess for a new run. The complete process was iterated until a convergence for the value of the orbital period. Although we used the system parameters reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnson et al. (2008)</ref> as initial guesses for the first run of our code, we found that MPFIT is generally insensitive to the initial guess, except the cases when the starting values significantly differ from the actual ones.</p><p>We followed the aforementioned procedure and also investigated the results for all system parameters using the four limb darkening coefficients from the 1D and 3D atmospheric modelling. Generally both approaches provided results in good agreement (at the one sigma level) with a Ï 2 value slightly smaller (&lt; 6%) for the derived parameters using the 3D limb darkening coefficients. Our best fitting model gave a/r * = 9.853 Â± 0.071, i = 85.634 â¢ Â± 0.056 â¢ , Ï * = 0.908 Â± 0.020 g cm â3 . <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> summarises the limb darkening coefficients used for each data set as well as the results for Rp/R * . The best fit models and detrended light curves for the three STIS and WFC3 white light curves are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>. We note that the systematics model identified individually for each white light curve differed from the ones identified from the joint fit of the four data sets. In the joint fit, the BIC was minimised for all STIS and WFC3 white light curves when we input models 4 and 3 from Table A1, respectively. As the results for i, a/R * and Rp/R * were found to be within one sigma for each model, similar to those for the individual white light curves, as summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> we adopted models 4 and 2 and report the final white light curve fit result according to them. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.

All transit times are reported in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> for convenience.</p><p>We find overall agreement between the derived system parameters of HAT-P-1 in this work and the most recent results available in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Torres et al. (2010)</ref> performed an uniform analysis of all ground based transit light curves coupled with the observable spectroscopic properties of HAT-P-1 and refined its physical parameters. For the main quantities that originate from a pure light curve fit: orbital inclination (i), normalised semimajor axis (a/R * ), and stellar density (Ï * ) our results differ with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Torres et al. (2010)</ref> at the â¼ 2Ï level. Notably the absolute values for all of the three parameters are below the values reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Torres et al. (2010)</ref>. Our measurements however, have much smaller uncertainties as they originate from a joint analysis of four transit observations, covering a complete transit, wide wavelength span and much higher precision compared to any of the present ground based photometric data sets and improve the precision of those quantities by a factor of a few. Finally, we employed limb darkening coefficients derived from a 3D stellar atmospheric models that explicitly take into account convective motions in the stellar surface granulation. That effect is neglected in the computation of limb darkening coefficients in the traditional 1D atmospheric models adopted in the previous analyses of HAT-P-1 data.</p><p>When coupled with radial velocity data, transit photometry can provide a list of astrophysical parameters for a given planetary system. We therefore also complemented the STIS and WFC3 white light curves of HAT-P-1 with the existing radial velocity data measurements, reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnson et al. (2008)</ref>. We excluded the radial velocity data that covers the Rossiter effect, as it is beyond the scope of this work to measure the spin orbit alignment of HAT-P-1. To perform a joint light curve and radial velocity modelling fit, we employed the publicly available EXOFAST package of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eastman et al. (2012)</ref>, which incorporates a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the fitted parameters and uncertainties. EXOFAST also served as an independent test for the propriety of our results and especially of the related uncertainties based on the MPFIT procedure. The physical parameters and the improved ephemeris derived from the joint fitting with MPFIT served as priors for EXOFAST. This assumption is necessary because of a limitation in EXOFAST that requires one to input a single band light curve in addition to the radial velocity data. Furthermore, we also modified the code to take into account the four parameter non linear limb darkening law instead of the currently available two-parameter quadratic limb darkening law. In addition, EXOFAST utilises the <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Torres et al. (2010)</ref> empirical polynomial relation between the masses and radii of stars, and their surface gravity (log g), effective temperatures (T eff ) and metallicities <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, based on a large sample of non-interacting binaries with accurately measured astrophysical parameters. The empirical relation hence allows a derivation of a complete list of orbital and physical properties based on a joint analysis of transit photometric and velocity data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eastman et al. 2012</ref>). We modelled each of the blue, red and near-infrared white light curves independently, except both STIS G430L curves which we fit simultaneously, as they originate from one band. We included the same models for the systematics as in the MPFIT analysis. The final results of all parameters represent the average values from the three fits, except those for i, a/R * and Rp/R * , which were computed using a weighted mean (as the EXOFAST values were found in good agreement with the MPFIT result and because we used four multi-epoch data sets). The transit ephemeris was derived using the approach described at the beginning of this section. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> summarises our final results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Transmission spectra fits</head><p>The primary science goal of this project was to construct a low resolution optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b and to pursue the prediction of strong optical absorbers such as sodium (observed through the (Na I doublet at Î» = 5893Ã5893Ã), potassium and water vapour or alternatively optical high altitude atmospheric hazes, gradually enhancing the absorption as a function of decreasing wavelength (i.e. Î» &lt; 6000Ã6000Ã) in the planetary atmosphere.

(2013)</ref> for details on the derivation of the WFC3 transmission spectrum.  rely on the MPFIT procedure and the system parameters derived from the joint analysis of the four white light curves in Section 3.1. In particular, for each light curve fit, we fix the orbital period (P ), inclination (i) and normalised semimajor axis (a/R * ) to their joint values along with the transit mid-times (TC) in each corresponding grating. Furthermore, we keep the four limb darkening coefficients fixed to their theoretical values. To construct the transmission spectrum in each grating, we fit for Rp/R * and the parameters describing the instrument systematics in the baseline function.</p><p>Model selection was performed for each grating assuming photometric errors based on pure photon noise. Once a given systematics model was selected, we re-estimated common uncertainties for our photometric data points, obtained from each spectral bin (i.e. taking the variance of the light curve residual). This is reasonable, because all photometric errors are equal in a given spectral bin as is typically the case for space-based observations. For example, we find no evidence in our data for a significant background variation  which potentially could cause a variation of the photometric errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">G430L</head><p>To construct the G430L transmission spectrum we produced light curves from spectral bins with custom sizes, common for both visits <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7 and 8</ref> fixed size (in this case â¼ 500Ã500Ã wide), as in various similar spectrophotometric studies. Although it seems natural to select an integer number and fixed size for the bins rather than various bin sizes, it has been found in the analysis that the light curves at that bin choice exhibited significant differences in the quality, except in the last two reddest bins. This is not surprising as the signal-to-noise of the data points in each light curve is correlated with the flux level within the wavelength range, constrained from the borders of each bin in the stellar spectrum and the sensitivity of STIS (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). We therefore choose to construct light curves from custom size bins, yet placing uniform constrain on the signalto-noise ratio of the photometric measurements, as determined naturally by the spectra. Ideally one would aim to select a bin size such as not to lose too much information of the subsequent transmission spectrum in larger bins, nor to obtain light curves from tiny bins dominated by photon noise. We therefore experimented with various bin sizes, such that the signal-to-noise ratio of each lightcurve was â¼ (2 â 3) Ã 10 3 . Following this approach for both G430L data sets, we constructed five bin sizes, as summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>. We measured the planet to star radius ratio (Rp/R * ) with a fit to the transit light curves originating from each wavelength bin. It has been found during the analysis that light curve fits with 3D limb darkening coefficients generally result in lower Ï 2 r compared to the 1D alternative (typically less than 1 â 2%). We therefore report the remaining of the analysis based on the 3D limb darkening coefficients. Model selection was performed in two stages: i) first we used the data from each grating individually and ii) combined in a simultaneous fit. In the first case it has been found that the BIC values for all of the competing models were similar without clearly indicated models. The lowest BIC values were obtained when using models 4 and 1 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> for details) for visits 7 and 8, respectively. However, it should be pointed out that both transmission spectra originating from the aforementioned models were remarkably similar in shape, i.e. the individual measurements agree within the 1Ï error bars. Although both related data sets were obtained at about four months difference (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), there is no evidence for a difference in the measured average level nor the shape of the transmission spectrum (in terms of Rp/R * ). This is unsurprisingly given the fact that the host star is not found to be active and there is no evidence for spot crossing events, which might cause wavelength dependent transitdepth shifts. A significant exception however, resulted for the measured Rp/R * based on the bluest bin (2900 â 3800Ã 3800Ã), where the difference is at â¼ 2Ï level (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref> for details). Notably, it was only that measurement that varied with â¼ 2Ï during the model selection stage for visit 7 from its initial value in agreement with the value from visit 8 down to its lowest position (Models 1 to 4, respectively). In contrast, the same spectral bin resulted in similar Rp/R * for visit 8 regardless of the applied systematics model. While we could interpret the described behaviour of the visit 7 data set in the bin range 2900â3800Ã3800Ã as indicative for unreliable data, we chose not to ignore it and proceeded to a simultaneous fit of both visits as the light curves complement each other in phase when taken together.</p><p>A simultaneous fit was performed to both blue visits aiming to derive a single value for the planet to star radius ratio (Rp/R * ). We examined again the BIC evolution using the four mentioned systematics models and also included a fifth case, based on the best result from the individual model selection approach. Generally, the transmission spectrum did not change from model-to-model. Again Rp/R * measured in the first bin was found to be the most unstable. However, in contrast to the first case, Rp/R * remained within â¼ 1Ï. The lowest BIC value was obtained for case model 5, i.e. models 4 and 1 for visits 7 and 8, respectively. In fact, this result is a confirmation to our previous finding in the individual model selection method. We therefore chose to complete the analysis of the blue part of the STIS transmission spectrum using those models. Finally, and to corroborate our results for the G430L transmission spectrum, we also shifted the spectral bins around their present position with 50Ã50Ã and examined the resulting transmission spectrum, finding no significant differences (i.e. larger than 1Ï). <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7</ref> report our final results. We further display the raw and detrended light curves along with the residuals in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">G750L</head><p>The red STIS data were analysed similar to the blue. Again, we choose custom bin sizes through the complete wavelength region yet aiming to obtain similar signal-to-noise ratios for each light curve in the range (2 â 3) Ã 10 3 . This approach ensures that each spectral bin produces light curve that is similar in quality to the remaining light curves from the entire grating.</p><p>Model selection was performed similar to grating G430L, attempting the four analytical models for systematics (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> for details). At each trial we constructed the transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b in terms of Rp/R * . Overall, the spectrum remained quite similar in shape and each measurement varied within 1Ï throughout the model selecting process. The BIC statistic was minimised for Model 2. We therefore performed the detrending of each bin of the G750L grating with that model. Similar to the analyses of the transmission spectrum of G430L, we also experimented with shifted spectral bins (Â±50ÃÂ±50Ã) to secure stability of the derived spectrum and found good agreement between the Rp/R * measurements from the three trials. Comprehensively we did not find a significant difference between Ï 2 values originating from the fits based on the 1D against 3D limb darkening coefficients due to the longer wavelengths covered by the G750L grating, where the variation of the limb darkening with wavelength is noticeably weaker. However, for clarity and consistency we report the results using the 3D models.</p><p>STIS fringe corrected versus uncorrected time series were employed to investigate the impact of the fringe effect on the resulting transmission spectra. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. (2007)</ref> we found that the fringe effect do not influence significantly the transmission spectrum when using large bin sizes (such as our three reddest bins). We choose to report the G750L transmission spectrum based from the fringe corrected data for clarity and consistency.</p><p>The transmission spectrum is marginally flat with increasing absorption longward of â¼ 8500Ã8500Ã and a deviation of the bin that brackets the sodium feature. As we describe in detail this part of the analysis in Section 3.2.3, we emphasise    that we report the wavelength range Î» = 5290 â 6500Ã6500Ã of the spectrum with the results from the sodium search. The final version of the G750L spectrum is summarised in Table 6 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Sodium</head><p>The most readily identifiable feature in the optical transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b is the sodium Na I doublet. We pursued the sodium signature employing the differential light curve procedures described in Charbonneau et al. corrected for systematics, that depend on the HST orbital phase (fourth order plinomial) and a linear time term (t). The detection of the individual lines of the sodium resonance doublet (Î»Na I = 5890Ã5890Ã and Î»Na II = 5896Ã5896Ã), separated only by â¼ 6 Ë A is hampered by the small scale of the STIS instrument (â¼ 5 Ë A pixel â1 ) at low spectral resolution (R = 500). In addition, the precise width of the feature we seek is unknown. We therefore, select bands of varying width, each centred on the sodium doublet (Î»Na = 5893Ã5893Ã), aiming similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref> to span "narrow", "medium" and "wide" wavelength regions. However, instead of using three bands we choose to perform a more detailed investigation of the evolution of the detection/nondetection of the sodium feature. The set of bands centred on the sodium feature are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90Ã90Ã wide. We also coupled each of these bands with "blue" and "red" bands with a width of 600Ã600Ã, in order to bracket the "center" band. We selected the out-bands to be significantly wider compared to the in-bands to secure stability of these reference measurements. We further produced photometric time series for each of these eighteen bands as described in Section 3.2.2. To investigate for the sodium feature we first computed the mean light curve of the blue "b(t)" and red "r(t)" bands and subtracted that light curve from the light curve of the centre "c(t)" band:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">DNa(t) = c(t) â [b(t) + r(t)]/2,</formula><p>where DNa(t) is the differential light curve. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Charbonneau et al. (2002)</ref>, the advantage of this linear combination is that it removes most of the variations due to the colour dependence of the limb darkening of the stellar continuum. We then computed the difference in the mean of the in-and out-of-transit data (indicated by the relevant subscripts): âDNa = DNa(tin) â DNa(tout). To estimate an uncertainty of the âDNa differences, we computed the standard deviation of the mean, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bevington &amp; Robinson (2003)</ref>. Following this procedure, we found that the sodium feature is detected in each of the six bands with a significance ranging as low as 1.2Ï for the 45Ã45Ã band to as high as 3.3Ï for the 30Ã30Ã band. We therefore report the exact values for the highest detection significance: âDNa = (â98 Â± 30) Ã 10 â5 . Furthermore, for the six central bands, starting with the narrowest to the widest we observe a monotonic decrease of the measured standard deviation of the out-of-transit data. These values are close to the predictions of photon noiselimited precision. We also used the aforementioned procedure with six bands and scanned the wavelength region +/ â 50Ã50Ã from the sodium resonance line in steps of 5 Ë A, which is close to the resolution of the STIS instrument. Sodium was detected only in the 30Ã30Ã region, centred on Î»Na = 5893Ã5893Ã and most significantly (i.e. strongest signal) when using the narrow bands. In addition, no signal was detected when we moved the bands more than +/ â 30Ã30Ã away from the sodium resonance line.</p><p>Although, the differential procedure significantly decreases the contribution of the stellar limb darkening to the variation of the transit depth, we must also quantify how much of the observed decrement is a result of the distinctive limb darkening exhibited by the sodium line relative to the adjacent continuum, calculating the differential limb darkened transit light curves, As evident in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11 (lower left  panel)</ref> the modelled differential time series shows only weak residual limb darkening effects.</p><p>In addition to the positive result from the differential method, we also detected the sodium feature by comparing the measured planet radii from individual fits of transit and systematics models (as in Section 3.2.2) to the six raw light curves from the blue, centre and red bands, respectively. This result is not surprising, given the accurate prediction of the stellar limb darkening, based on 3D atmospheric models. <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref> (left panels) summarises the sodium detection from both approaches described above.</p><p>Based on the result for a significantly deeper transit in the sodium band (3.3Ï) compared to the adjacent red and blue bands and the negligible contribution of the residual limb darkening, we conclude that we have detected sodium in the planetary atmosphere of HAT-P-1b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Potassium and HÎ±</head><p>We followed the two methods, described in Section 3.2.3 to inspect the STIS data for potassium. Because the potassium spectral signature is known to be formed by a doublet, centred at Î»K â 7684Ã7684Ã with two cores separated by 34Ã34Ã, we first employed only the set of medium and wide bands, i.e. 45, 60, 75 and 90Ã90Ã, centred at Î»K . Each of the four bands showed no detection of transit depth decrement due to potassium when applying both methods. We therefore report the result for the 75Ã75Ã wide band that brackets the doublet: âDK = (1Â±28)Ã10 â5 (see the right-hand panels in <ref type="figure">Fig. 11)</ref>. The out-of-transit data resulted in standard deviation of 6.4Ã10 â4 which is close to the expectation of photon noise-limited precision. We further investigated each of the potassium cores individually with the complete set of bands, i.e. including the two narrow ones. In the case of Î»K D2 = 7667Ã7667Ã, we find no evidence of a significant variation in the transit depth, with the highest value at the 60Ã60Ã wide band with âDK D2 = (â25 Â± 24) Ã 10 â5 and limb darkening also consistent with no variation: âD ld = (12 Â± 16) Ã 10 â5 . The second core Î»K D1 = 7701Ã7701Ã also gave results consistent with no variation, indicating no presence of potassium. Based on these results we therefore conclude that there is no evidence in our data for the presence of potassium in the atmosphere HAT-P-1b.</p><p>We also inspected the red STIS data for extra absorption in HÎ± line (6563Ã6563Ã), following the aforementioned approach. We found no variation of the transit depth at that wavelength.</p></div>

Based on current giant planet atmospheric models, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Howe &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. ( , 2010</ref>, described in detail in Section 4, the water feature is expected to peak higher than the base of the wings of the sodium and potassium resonance doublets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 14  and 13)</ref>. Surprisingly, in the case of HAT-P-1b the water feature peaks nearly at the level of the wing bases of the sodium and potassium doublets (see Rp/R * for systematic models 2 and 3 for the red STIS and the WFC3 data, respectively in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1 in the appendix or Table 3</ref>). Clearly, an alternative statement can be formulated presuming a higher optical level compared to a low water feature. Regardless the choice of formulation however, a fundamental question can be raised about the possible shifts in altitude between the three transmission spectra. One speculation for the observed difference could be attributed to stellar activity and spot crossing events. However, based on our stellar activity monitoring (see Section 2.2) we see no evidence in our monitoring data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref> with Ca II H&amp;K chromospheric line emission index of log R â² H&amp;K = â4.984, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al. (2010)</ref>) for variability of HAT-P-1 above Â±0.5 % (a scatter of 2 mmag consistent with the photometric noise), which is also compatible with the low chromospheric activity concluded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> and the fact that we do not observe any spot crossings during the transits. This hypothesis hence, cannot explain the observed difference of 4.3 Â± 1.6 H, where H = 414 km is the assumed scale height of HAT-P-1b. Another explanation for the observed difference could be a systematics in the data reduction stage. To help test this hypothesis and to place an absolute uncertainty on the levels of the transmission spectra we investigated the variation of the white light Rp/R * measurements (including the known correlation of Rp/R * with a/R * and i), as we varied a/R * and i within their best-fit values with uncertainties (see Section 3.1). In particular, while keeping a/R * as a free parameter, we fixed the value of the orbital inclination (i) to its lower and upper limits and obtained two radius estimates. The same approach gave two radius estimates when fixing a/R * and varying i. We then fixed both a/R * and i to their upper and lower values, respectively and obtained another two radius estimates; the final two estimates were obtained while keeping one of the parameters to its low/high value while fixing the other to its high/low value.   <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>.

First, the WFC3 data results in a significantly lower Rp/R * value, compared to the STIS data. In fact, we also investigated the influence of the differential (with respect to HAT-P-1B companion star) versus single flux white light curve obtained from the WFC3 data. Both results for Rp/R * were found in good agreements (within their uncertaintes) with slightly higher value from the differential light curve; and second, contrary to our results at the systematic model selection stage (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> in the appendix), the WFC3 white light curve showed the smallest spread in Rp/R * , followed by the red and blue STIS data.

We estimated the related uncertainty by propagating the mean uncertainties (based on the eight Rp/R * estimates) for each grating/grism.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Placed together, the blue and red STIS transmission spectra exhibit several noticeable features. Based on the two methods, described in Section 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, we conclude that we detected sodium (at the 3.3Ï level at Î» = 5893Ã5893Ã), but no excess absorption due to potassium nor Balmer HÎ± (at Î» = 7683Ã7683Ã and 6563Ã6563Ã, respectively) in the HAT-P-1b planet atmosphere. The blue spectrum exhibits a gradual increase toward shorter wavelengths, while the red spectrum is marginally flat with an enhanced absorption beyond â¼ 8500Ã8500Ã.

Our choice to employ two independently derived sets of atmospheric models is governed by the fact that not all model sets in the literature agree, as they were computed using different methods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Shabram et al. 2011</ref> for details). To perform a comparison between theory and observation we employed pre-computed models and proceeded as follows. From each model, we averaged the model within the wavelength bins that were used to construct the observational transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b (as detailed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref>). Then the pre-computed models were fit to the data with a single free parameter that controls their vertical position, i.e. without any influence on the model shape. For each model we computed the Ï 2 statistic to quantify model selection. As the models are pre-computed, the number of degrees of freedom at this stage of the analysis is constant for each model, i.e. DoF = n â m, where n is the number of data points (see the following text for each sets of models) and m is the number of fitted parameters, i.e. m = 1.

(2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. ( , 2010</ref>) with two equilibrium temperature regimes, different from the one of HAT-P-1b (i.e. â¼ 1200 K). Such analysis helps provide a general understanding of the observed features as well as any departures from them. The first regime included isothermal models with equilibrium temperature of Teq = 1500 K, (to represent the hotter dayside) with and without TiO/VO. The second regime included a model at lower equilibrium temperature Teq = 1000 K that represents a cooler terminator and not containing TiO/VO. The fit to the Teq = 1000 K isothermal model is the best from the three isothermal models fit to the data, with Ï 2 = 168 and 41 degrees of freedom (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 13)</ref>. In fact, a temperature of 1000 K is also consistent with the result from <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wakeford et al. (2013)</ref>. The TiO/VO containing model gave a lower Ï 2 than the nonTiO/VO model (Ï 2 = 218 and 324, respectively), because of the enhanced absorption of the TiO/VO model in the range Î» â¼ 4000 â 9000Ã9000Ã (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 13</ref>). The presence of TiO/VO has to be further investigated, as the enhanced absorption in the observed spectrum behaves differently than the theoretical expectation. To test this hypothesis we employed the "comb" filter described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huitson et al. (2013)</ref> and checked for the presence of TiO features. In summary, the filter is a comb of "in-TiO" and "out-TiO" bands, which is sensitive to the smaller features within the large TiO signature in the optical region. The same bands were applied to the two isothermal hydrostatic models (with and without TiO/VO) with an equilibrium temperature Teq = 1500 K and surface gravity 10 m s â2 and theoretical values derived to compare with the differential measurements from our data. Following this approach we found a differential absorption depth, scaled to H = 414 km, of âz/H = 0.16 Â± 0.69 from the data and theoretical values for the TiO and non-TiO models were 0.94 and 0.44, respectively. Since the observational result is consistent with no variation, closer to the theoretical value of the non-TiO model, and the overall fit is rather poor, we conclude that the TiO model is not consistent with the data.</p><p>An attempt to perform a better fit to the data was also done incorporating isothermal models, pre-computed for the HAT-P-1b case (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 14)</ref>, however with additional parametric adjustments. First, an unknown "extra absorber" at altitude of constant optical opacity 0.03 cm 2 g â1 (from 4000 to 10000Ã10000Ã) was incorporated to the isothermal model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. (2010)</ref>. The extra absorber, whatever its nature, increases the ratio of the optical to infrared radii, which is similar to the wavelength dependent radius variation in the STIS and WFC3 results and has been used to interpret Spitzer secondary eclipse observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>). In addition, the sodium abundance was increased by a factor of 10 3 to potentially represent the sodium detection measurement in the spectral bin 5878 â 5908Ã5908Ã. Decreasing the degrees of freedom with 2, due to the two adjustments in the model, we found that this specific model is an improved fit to the data with Ï 2 = 105 and 39 degrees of freedom (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 14)</ref>. The model however, cannot adequately reproduce the enhanced absorption in the bluest and reddest parts of the transmission spectrum (i.e. at decreasing wavelengths shorter than Î» 5500Ã5500Ã and longer than Î» 8500Ã8500Ã), as it assumes uniform absorption. Furthermore, even with the enhanced super sodium content the model sodium line prediction seems to be a rather poor match to the observational result. For consistency we also fitted the theoretical models after ignoring the reddest data points of the blue and red transmission spectra. In these cases the Ï 2 decreased significantly down to 66 for 37 degrees of freedom.</p><p>Second, the HAT-P-1b isothermal model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. ( , 2010</ref> was adjusted with an enhanced (factor of 10 3 more) Rayleigh scattering in order to reproduce the observational result. This model resulted in Ï 2 = 122 and 40 degrees of freedom (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 14)</ref>. However, incorporating more intense Rayleigh scattering seems to mask/suppress the sodium feature. Removing the two reddest outliers the Ï 2 decreased to 66 for 39 degrees of freedom.</p><p>While the list of theoretical models presented in this study is diverse it is far from complete. An optical absorber/scattering may be needed to explain HAT-P-1b's optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum, as suggested by the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fortney et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. ( , 2010</ref> discussed in the last two paragraphs, respectively. However, these two scenarios will be put into future test with further theoretical models attempting to explain our data and to further constrain HAT-P-1b planetary atmosphere.</p></div>

(2011b)</ref>, the feature discussed here of HAT-P-1b is pronounced in the blue grating only, which significantly differs from the case of HD 189733 b, where the feature dominates the complete optical to nearinfrared wavelength regime (3000Ã3000Ã to 10000Ã10000Ã). Based on the simultaneous fit, the value for the slope is found to be 2100 Â± 672 km over a wavelength range from 2900Ã2900Ã to 5700Ã5700Ã. Lecavelier Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Etangs et al. (2008)</ref> showed that the effective altitude (z) of an exoplanet atmosphere (for a given atmospheric structure and composition) at a wavelength Î» and assuming a power law for the cross-section of the scattering particles of the form Ï = Ïo(Î»/Î»o) Î± (where Î± is the index for the scattering law) , is given by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">z(Î») = kT Âµg ln Î¾ abs Po Ïeq 2ÏRp kT Âµg Ïo Î» Î»o Î± , (7)</formula><p>where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the atmospheric temperature, Âµ is the mean molecular weight of the atmospheric particles, g is the surface gravity, Î¾ abs is the abundance of the dominant absorbing species; Po is the pressure at the reference altitude, Ïeq is the optical depth at the transmission spectral radius. Following the discussion of Lecavelier Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Etangs et al.

We find Î±T = â7535 Â± 2411 K, assuming g = 877 cm s 2 . The dayside average brightness temperature of HAT-P-1b has been determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Todorov et al. (2010)</ref> to be T = 1500 Â± 100 K, from secondary eclipse observations with Spitzer. This is likely too high for our terminator spectra at lower temperatures and lower pressures with the water feature detected in WFC3 data implying a value closer to 1000 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wakeford et al. 2013</ref>). Assuming this temperature, our result translates to Î± = â7.5 Â± 2.4. The derived value with uncertainty for Î± opens up a discussion about the chemical composition of the particles causing the absorption signature within the uncertainty band from â â5 to â â10. Generally, and apart from the molecular hydrogen contents, the chemical composition of gases that cause different slopes in the short optical wavelength regimes are not well known. However, in the case of Rayleigh scattering, the predicted value is Î± = â4, which is close to the lowest border of our result as one of the possibilities. It is hence interesting to speculate the possible source of opacity in the atmosphere of HAT-P-1 b particularly in that case. observational data and the measured slope in the transmission spectrum of HD189733b and suggested MgSiO3 as a possible source of opacity.</p><p>The estimated slope value for HAT-P-1b implies a scattering different from Rayleigh, though it depends on the temperature at the different altitudes, and followup observations will be needed to better characterise this slope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballester et al. (2007)</ref> proposed an alternative explanation for the slope of the transmission spectrum of HD 209458b below 4000Ã4000Ã as a result of absorption in the Balmer lines and continuum by an optically thin layer of excited hydrogen atoms at high altitude in the planetary atmosphere. Given the single measurement comprising the highest uncertainty of our combined blue transmission spectrum (short ward to 4000Ã4000Ã), it is challenging to put this hypothesis into test given the HAT-P-1b data.</p><p>A second alternative explanation to the Rayleigh scattering has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barman (2007)</ref> who considered an increase of the absorption in the wavelength range below 5000Ã5000Ã due to atomic lines. The strongest absorption in that wavelength range is expected to be determined mainly by the lines of Ca I, Fe I, Al I and Cr I. The strongest among those lines (Ca I) is expected to be centred abound 4230Ã4230Ã. If the abundance of Ca is high one would expect the presence of the Ca I and quite possible of some of the other lines in the blue transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b. However, the present spectral bin sizes are much too large (as constrained by the SNR of the data in each spectral bin) to secure a plausible and robust detection of such narrow spectral features.</p></div>

We searched but did not detect the broad line wings of the sodium feature, which are predicted by both <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al.

As HAT-P-1b is the second case after HD 209458b with evidence of enhanced absorption at wavelengths long-ward to 8500Ã8500Ã it is likely that the observed effect is real and can be attributed to absorption in these two planetary atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">The relative sodium abundance</head><p>Exoplanet transmission spectra allow the abundances to be determined from identified absorption features. In the case of HAT-P-1b, when two or more signatures are present, the relative abundance can be measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">DÃ©sert et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huitson et al. 2012</ref>). HAT-P-1b is only the second case (after HD 209458b) in the atmosphere of which signatures from both sodium and water are conclusively detected with transmission spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Charbonneau et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sing et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Deming et al. 2013</ref>). For HAT-P-1b, the base of the missing sodium wings are higher than the peak of the water feature, and a possible explanation could incorporate an enhanced abundance of sodium in the planet atmosphere.</p><p>The relative abundance of the sodium to water, assuming a constant temperature and pressure is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Î¾Na Î¾H 2 O = ÏH 2 O ÏNa e (Z Na âZ H 2 O )/H ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where Î¾Na and Î¾H 2 O are the abundances, ÏNa and ÏH 2 O are the wavelength-dependent cross sections at 5893Ã5893Ã and 1.4 Âµm, respectively and ZNa and ZH 2 O are the altitudes of the observed features. However, in the HAT-P-1b case there is further complication as the individual cores of the sodium doublet are not resolved at the spectral resolution of our data and we also did not find evidence for the presence of pressure broadened sodium wings. This limitation prevents determination of the pressure level observed in our transmission spectrum, which is degenerate with absolute abundance measurements. It also hampers the modelling of the sodium lines and limits a derivation of temperature with altitude.</p><p>The temperature also has a small effect on ÏNa. If the temperature is not constant as a function of altitude (z), the abundance measurement will be affected since higher temperatures cause an increase in z for the same cross-section. To estimate the relative sodium to water abundance ratios, ideally one would employ the measured radii of both species at the same altitude, corresponding to similar temperatures. Although we are prevented of such luxury due to the limitation of the low resolution data, we provide an abundance measurement assuming that both features occur in atmospheric regions of the same temperature. Using an average scale height of 414 km (which assumes a temperature of 1000 K) and similar temperature between the Na and H2O features, we estimate an upper limit of the sodium abundance compared to water. We assumed water cross-section ÏH 2 O = 8.9 Ã 10 â22 cm 2 based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sharp &amp; Burrows (2007)</ref>. To compute the sodium cross section we followed the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huitson et al. (2012)</ref>, however we normalised the integrated cross-section to the stellar spectrum over the 30Ã30Ã bin (used to detect sodium in this study), which gave ÏNa = 2.3 Ã 10 â20 cm 2 . Using the derived cross-sections and the measured Rp/R * = 0.1223 Â± 0.0014 for the sodium line and Rp/R * = 0.11631 Â± 0.0003 for the water feature (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> and A1, respectively), one finds ln (Î¾Na/Î¾H 2 O ) = +4.6 Â± 2.2. For comparison, the solar abundance ratio of sodium to water is ln (Î¾Na/Î¾H 2 O ) solar = â5.0 to â4.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lodders 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lodders &amp; Fegley 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sharp &amp; Burrows 2007)</ref>. Despite a large uncertainty, this result indicates an overabundance of sodium compared to water. While we considered an enhanced (factor of 10 3 , i.e. ln (Î¾Na/Î¾H 2 O ) supersolar = +2.3) sodium to water abundance in the specific theoretical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al.

This and additional competing scenarios would be needed to further constrain the atmosphere of HAT-P-1b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Interpretation</head><p>The complete optical to near-infrared HAT-P-1b transmission spectrum from STIS and WFC3 constraints several important features of the planet atmosphere. First of all, the red STIS spectra show evidence of sodium (3.3Ï significance) and lack of potassium. The fact that the sodium cores have been detected but not the wings can potentially be explained by an extra absorber or scatter, which obscurs/masks sodium and potassium features <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Seager &amp; Sasselov 2000)</ref>. This is in accord with the lack of any evidence in the STIS G750L data of potassium and the overall marginally flat transmission spectrum, which makes the optical spectrum of HAT-P-1b similar to that of HD 209458b. This is potentially interesting, because both host stars are of similar spectral type and metallicity. One explanation for the lack of potassium, and presence of sodium could be a general underabundance of potassium in the HAT-P-1b atmosphere. Moreover, compared to potassium the sodium atom requires somewhat more energy to ionise. In particular, the first ionisation energies for sodium and potassium are XNa â¼ 500 kJ mol â1 and XK â¼ 420 kJ mol â1 , respectively, which can partially explain the presence of sodium and no potassium, if there is significant non-thermal ionisation, which is reasonable for highly-irradiated planets. Furthermore, the neutral potassium is â¼ 1.7 times heavier (ma = 39 amu 12 ) than the sodium (ma = 23 amu) atom, which may make it harder to vertically mix the species.</p><p>The optical STIS data rules out also an atmosphere dominated by high altitude cloud layer. If it existed, such hypothetical cloud deck would be expected to block (depending on its properties) the complete optical to near-infrared spectrum. Instead, the spectrum exhibits two opposite slopes and a sodium line core in the optical and water feature in the near-infrared.</p><p>A comparative analysis of the data with theoretical models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fortney et al. (2010)</ref> shows that an atmosphere dominated by TiO in the optical regime could hardly explain the optical STIS results. This is no surprise given the medium equilibrium temperature of HAT-P-1 is â¼ 1000 â 1300 K, which is expected not be able to sustain gaseous titanium and vanadium oxides. These compounds are expected to rain down in solids at these temperatures and hence such gases are not expected to determine the opacity in the optical regime. Compared to the water feature in the near-infrared, the STIS optical spectrum has much higher overall opacity. The observed offset cannot be explained as due to stellar activity of the host star nor as a result of the non-linearity of the WFC3 detector. A reason for the second case is that the WFC3 spectra were obtained well within the linear regime of the camera. Finally, adopting a uniform analysis of the STIS and the WFC3 data sets we also rule out a calibration error as a potential explanation for the observed offset. We are hopeful that near-future observations of the HAT-P-1b system may further glean more evidence for the difference between the optical and nearinfrared transmission spectra. While the theoretical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burrows et al. (2010)</ref> with unknown extra absorber and an increased (factor 10 3 ) sodium to water abundance ratio is a step in improving the fit to the HAT-P-1b STIS and WFC3 data, this scenario would be tastable along with additional competing scanarios. If confirmed, it would suggest that the HAT-P-1b atmosphere is dominated by an absorber in the optical, partially blocking the sodium wings and completely masking the potassium feature, yet leaving an unmuted water feature at 1.4Âµm.</p></div>

Despite its wider nature, compared to sodium, we find no evidence for the potassium feature in the low resolution STIS data.</p><p>The STIS G430L spectrum shows an increasing absorption shortward to 5300Ã5300Ã. The measured slope Î± = â7.5 Â± 2.4 (assuming brightness temperature T = 1000 K) spans a range of possible scattering signatures approaching Rayleigh (i.e. a slope with Î± = â4) at the lower limit of our measurement. However, more clarification and constraints can be derived with additional followup data, that would increase the accuracy of the derived slope.</p><p>Given these characteristics the optical transmission spectrum of HAT-P-1b seems analogous to HD 209458b in many ways. However, a significant difference between both is that HAT-P-1b contains only a core of the sodium line, while HD 209458b shows broad line wings and extra absorption shortward of the sodium central line.</p><p>After a uniform analysis of the white light curves, we combined our STIS spectrum with the spectrum of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wakeford et al.

However, this model is unable to reproduce the enhanced absorption in the blue and red STIS spectrum. Further modelling incorporating additional scenarios would be needed to test the plausibility of this hypothesis.

There are several interesting facts that can be concluded from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref>. First of all, assuming that the photometric uncertainties for each of the three STIS white light curves are dominated by systematics (given the negligible dark current and read-out noise of the STIS CCD detector) the reduced chi square (Ï 2 r ) can be used as in indicator for the level of the photon noise of our data. In particular one can conclude that for the three white light curves the data is at about â¼ 44 â 52% of the theoretical photon noise. Certainly one might doubt that the systematics model could be significantly different from the favoured models in the present analysis. However, the STIS white light curves analysed here show no significant correlations to any of the quantified systematics in order to suggest a functional model for the later. We therefore rely on the lowest BIC values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> as a model indicator of a systematics function of the STIS data. Compared to the STIS white light curves the BIC behaves significantly different for the WFC3 data. The statistic constantly decreases with increasing number of the orders of the HST and planet orbital phases. While we might blindly accept the BIC result and choose model 5 as most appropriate it would be rather hard to point out a physical explanation for the sixth or seventh order HST orbital phase (Ït). We therefore assume model 3 as a sufficiently good analytic approximation for the systematics in WFC3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A: MODEL SELECTION FOR THE SYSTEMATICS OF THE STIS AND WFC3 WHITE LIGHT CURVES</head><p>Another interesting fact that can be concluded from Table A1 is that the individual light curve fits for visits <ref type="bibr">7, 8 &amp; 20</ref> as well as the WFC3 show noticeably similar results for the system parameters (a/R * and i) at the one sigma level, regardless the applied model for the systematics. The later conclusion is also valid for the estimated transit depths (measured with Rp/R * ) for both G430L data sets for which the measured Rp/R * values from each visit (separated more than 100 days in time) agree well for a given model. Visit 20 shows one outlier for Rp/R * (model 1, which is unfavored though) which still differs from the highest value at a rather lower level ( 1.4 sigma). However, in the result for WFC3 we observe more than 3.5Ï difference between the minimum and maximum values for Rp/R * (models 3 and 1, respectively). This is an important fact which will be discussed again when we paste the STIS and WFC3 transmission spectra in Section 3.2.5. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
