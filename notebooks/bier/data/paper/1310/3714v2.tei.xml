			<abstract>
				<p>We present the method of multiplexed imaging designed for astronomical observations of large sky areas in the IR, visible and UV frequencies. Our method relies on the sparse nature of astronomical observations. The method consists of an optical system that directs light from different locations on the focal plane of a telescope onto the same detector area and an algorithm that reconstructs the original wide-field image. In this way we can use a physically small detector to cover a wide field of view. We test our reconstruction algorithm using public space telescope data. Our tests demonstrate the reliability and power of the multiplexed imaging method. Using our method it will be possible to increase the sky area covered with space telescopes by 1-3 orders of magnitude , depending on the specific scientific goal and optical parameters. This method can significantly increase the volume of astronomical surveys, including search programs for exoplanets and transients using space and ground instruments.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Observing a large area of the sky</head><p>Surveying a large sky area is one of the most common and elementary types of observation. In principle, one would want to image as wide an area of the sky as possible, at high spatial resolution and through a telescope with a large aperture. Covering a wide field at high resolution requires a detector with a large physical area and many pixels, leading to high cost and complexity.</p><p>Astronomers deal with this problem in two ways:</p><p>• Using complex and expensive arrays of detectors.</p><p>• Using detectors with large pixels, at the expense of resolution.</p><p>We propose a novel method to address this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The origin of noise in astronomical observations</head><p>The performance of the multiplexed imaging method strongly depends on the properties of the relevant noise. We consider the following origins of noise in astronomical observations.</p><p>• Poisson noise -The difference between the expected flux of energy coming from a light source (or a noise source) and the flux actually arrived.</p><p>• Background noise -The fluctuations in the number of photons originating in the space between the observer and the source (e.g, atmospheric background noise and zodiacal light).</p><p>• Read noise and instrumental thermal noise (dark current): The noise coming from the process of reading the data from the detector and the electrons that originate in the electronics and the detector itself.</p><p>When imaging from the ground, all types of noise exist and contribute, while when imaging from space, in some situations we can neglect the background noise and assume that the only sources of noise are the read noise and the Poisson noise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Sparsity of astronomical images</head><p>A very important feature of many astronomical images is that they are almost empty. When we pick a random patch of sky and observe it (not a specifically chosen close galaxy, nebula or dense star cluster) there are very few objects with non-zero flux. Most of them are either point source objects (the size of the seeing disk) or small patches (like distant galaxies) with sizes on the scale of a few arcseconds. Our analysis only applies to sparse images because the source of the improvement that we offer is the sparsity of the part of the sky observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Multiplexed Imaging Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The general idea</head><p>We propose to use the sparse nature of astronomical images to effectively measure all objects contained in the corrected field of view of a telescope using a physically small detector, without reducing the resolution. This is done by projecting different areas of the focal plane simultaneously onto the detector. Because of the scarcity of objects one can perform scientific measurements using the combined images with the same quality and greater efficiency compared to mosaicking. Flux measurements of known sources in combined images can be done directly (e.g to search for transients ans planets). Using sub-observations it is possible to chart an unknown part of the sky.</p><p>In section 3 we analyze both cases and present our recovery algorithm. In section 4 we analyze the efficiency gain factor of our method under different dominant noise sources and show that multiplexed imaging is very efficient when the dominant noise source is either Poisson or read noise. In section 5 we show simulations of our charting recovery algorithm. In section 6 we analyze the possible impacts of the method on instruments designed for sky surveys, finding exoplanets, looking for transients, fast photometry and lucky imaging, finding orders of magnitude potential improvements to the area observed per unit time. A conceptual optical realization of this method is discussed in <ref type="bibr">Ben-Ami et al. (in preparation)</ref>, and laboratory experiments with this design are ongoing.</p></div>

Each sub-observation is a measurement of the sum of the flux from K areas on the focal plane.</p><p>• The time each observation takes depends on the exposure time T e , readout time T r and slew time T s . When referring to two different exposure times, the duration of multiplexed imaging will be denoted by T * e .</p><p>• The total time required for one observation using multiplexed imaging is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T * total = M (T * e + T r ) + T s</formula><p>• Regular imaging can be thought of as multiplexed imaging with K = 1 and M = N (it will take N observations to cover the whole area). In that case T total = N (T e + T r + T s ).</p><p>• The efficiency E of the system is given by the time required to cover the described area with the regular mode divided by the time required to do so with the multiplexed method, when both observations have the same SNR, meaning</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E = N (T e + T r + T s ) M (T * e + T r ) + T s (and T *</formula><p>e is adjusted to match the SNR).</p><p>• For example, under the assumptions that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T e &gt;&gt; T s + T r<label>(1)</label></formula><p>(which is not always the case, see section 4.2) and M T * e = T e (which will make the SNR equal when the dominant source of noise is Poisson noise) this yields E = N (Te+Tr+Ts)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M (T * e +Tr)+Ts ≈ N Te Te ≈ N .</formula><p>• We will define the object surface density d to be the number of sources in one part of the sky divided by the area of sky observed.</p><p>• Denote by P the average (over sources with different intensities and sizes) number of pixels that have a statistically significant contribution per object.</p><p>• The assumption that a sky area is sparse means that P d &lt;&lt; 1 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>• The best possible multiplexing and the absolute upper limit on K satisfies KP d ≈ 1, which means that we are measuring a non-trivial flux with every pixel of our detector.</p><p>• Generally P d depends on many parameters such as the depth of the observation, the filter, the field observed, the plate scale and the seeing.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Recovering the original observation</head><p>We consider separately two scientific cases: charting and re-observing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Charting</head><p>We define charting as an observation of a part of the sky that is unknown to the resolution and depth in question. In this mode, since we have no prior knowledge of the position of every object, we need to obtain several sub-observations, allowing for each part of the sky to have a specific pattern of appearance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>) in order to recover the correct position of each source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Re-observing</head><p>When re-observing, we have a prior image of the relevant region of the sky. Our observational goal in re-observing mode is to measure the flux from previously known objects, measuring variability or searching for new transients. In the re-observing mode we can calculate for each pixel on the image a-priory (using our known mapping of the sky) which areas on the focal plane contribute to the measured flux, allowing for a simple recovery algorithm. The number of sub-observations required and therefore also the efficiency depends on whether the scientific mission requires to measure all the objects in the field, or just as many of them as possible. Those two cases are analyzed separately. The case where it suffices to measure only most of the objects should allow using a trivial recovery algorithm, and requires only ≈ 1 sub-observations. The other case, where all objects in the field are important, is similar to the charting mode because different objects falling on the same detector area must be dealt with. This case is not addressed in this paper as we expect it to be rare.</p><p>With recent advances in the recording of a multi-wavelength static image of much of the sky, e.g., by surveys such as SDSS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(York et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">) PS1 (Kaiser et al. 2010</ref>) and PTF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Law et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Rau et al. 2009</ref>) in the optical, GALEX <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Martin et al. 2005</ref>) in the UV and 2MASS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>), UKIDSS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lawrence et al. 2007</ref>) and WISE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wright et al. 2010</ref>) in the IR, the re-observing mode is likely to be the common mode (see applications 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Construction of the sets</head><p>The recovery algorithm is simple, but to present it, we first need to introduce some notations and construct the sets of regions of sky combined during each sub-observation. We use N , M , and K as defined before.</p><p>Denote the set of sky regions combined during sub-observation 0 ≤ i &lt; M by C i . Denote the flux recorded in sub-observation i at pixel location x by f i <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref> and denote the flux arriving to pixel x from region j on the focal plane by g j <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>. The expected flux (without noise) at each pixel is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f i [x] = j∈C i g j [x]</formula><p>Denote for each region j on the focal plane, the representing vector (a binary vector of length M ) v j ∈ {0, 1} M indicating if the flux from region j is combined during sub-observation i.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v j [i] = 0 j / ∈ C i 1 j ∈ C i</formula><p>And denote the set of representing vectors</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V = { − → v i } N −1 i=0 .</formula><p>The representing vectors determine uniquely the set of regions that are included in each sub-observation and they can be chosen by the algorithm designer ahead of making the observation. This allows us to choose in a special way the set of vectors such that there will be no ambiguity in the reconstruction algorithm.</p><p>Denote the vector of measured fluxes from all sub-observations at a pixel x on the detector by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">− → µ = (f 0 [x], f 1 [x], . . . , f M −1 [x])</formula><p>If a specific pixel x has exactly one non-zero flux contribution coming from a specific sky region j, then there exists a real number a such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">− → µ = a − → v j 3.3</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.1. A simple example</head><p>When constructing the sets, the recovery ambiguity problem has to be dealt with, and to demonstrate it we will use a simple set of parameters: we choose N = 3, K = 2 and M = 2. We will denote the focal plane sub-areas by {0, 1, 2} as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3</ref>. The sets we use are C 0 = {0, 1} and C 1 = {0, 2}. The sub-observations we use are therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">f 0 [x] = g 0 [x] + g 1 [x] and f 1 [x] = g 0 [x] + g 2 [x]. The representing vectors will be − → v 0 = (1, 1), − → v 1 = (1, 0), − → v 2 = (0, 1). For every pixel location x we can construct − → µ = (f 0 [x], f 1 [x]).</formula><p>If for a pixel location we observe</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">− → µ = (a, 0) = a(1, 0) = a − → v 1 we can deduce that g 1 [x] = a and g 0 [x] = g 2 [x] = 0.</formula><p>If for a pixel location we observe</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">− → µ = (0, a) = a(0, 1) = a − → v 2 we can deduce that g 2 [x] = a and g 0 [x] = g 1 [x] = 0.</formula><p>If for a pixel location we observe</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">− → µ = (a 1 , a 1 ) = a 2 (1, 0) + a 2 (0, 1) + (a 1 − a 2 )(1, 1) = a 2 − → v 1 + a 2 − → v 2 + (a 1 − a 2 ) − → v 0 we can deduce that g 0 [x] = a 1 − a 2 and g 1 [x] = g 2 [x] = a 2 .</formula><p>This demonstrates a possible ambiguity, even without considering observational errors. There could be more than one combination of fluxes that will generate the same observed vector. This problem is inherent because we have less measurements than free parameters we are trying to measure (here we try to measure 3 free parameters,</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">g 0 [x], g 1 [x], g 2 [x]</formula><p>, but we have only 2 measurements,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f 0 [x], f 1 [x])</formula><p>. This is where the sparsity assumption is necessary. We assume the original image is sparse, meaning that most of the measured parameters are 0, and therefore we assume the correct recovery in this case is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">g 0 [x] = a 1 and g 1 [x] = g 2 [x] = 0.</formula><p>If for a pixel location we observe − → µ = (a 1 , a 2 ) we cannot recover the original fluxes because the following cases are equally likely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">• g 0 [x] = 0, g 1 [x] = a 1 and g 2 [x] = a 2 • g 0 [x] = a 1 , g 1 [x] = 0 and g 2 [x] = a 2 − a 1 .</formula><p>In this case we cannot solve the ambiguity and we cannot determine neither the locations nor the fluxes of the non-zero sources. We should therefore construct the sets C i carefully, preventing ambiguities when few sources are contributing non-zero flux to a pixel location.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Preventing the ambiguity</head><p>The most basic requirement on our sets is that if there is only one non-zero flux contributing to a location x then the recovery is unique. From here we can immediately deduce a strict demand on the construction of the set V : For every pair of different vectors, − → v , − → w ∈ V and for all pairs of real numbers a, b = 0 the following should hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">a − → v = b − → w This demand, implying − → v = − → w and − → v = − → 0 , ∀v ∈ V</formula><p>, defines the absolute lower bound for the number M of sub-observations to chart N regions of the focal-plane, which is M ≥ log 2 (N + 1).</p><p>It is sub-optimal to recover only objects that do not overlap with other objects (this limits the multiplexing number N (and therefore K) to be smaller than desired, leading to smaller region of the sky being observed). Therefore we wish to construct our sets such that unique recovery is guaranteed also when two objects fall on the same detector area, (and with high probability will be unique even when there are 3 or more objects falling on the same detector area). In the case of two objects, in a similar fashion, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">− → µ = a 1 − → v i 1 + a 2 − → v i 2</formula><p>Again, we choose the set V to hold an analogue condition: for every quadruplet of different vectors,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">− → v i 1 , − → v i 2 , − → v j 1 , − → v j 2 ∈ V</formula><p>and for all quadruplets of real numbers a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 the following should hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">a 1 − → v i 1 + a 2 − → v i 2 = b 1 − → v j 1 + b 2 − → v j 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In our simple example above, this condition does not hold, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">− → v 1 + − → v 2 = − → v 0</formula><p>This fact is the cause of the ambiguity in the recovery.</p><p>When we consider the charting of weak sources, another source of confusion can be the noise (of all kinds). If two regions of sky have close representing vectors, i.e || − → v i − − → v j || 2 is small, then it is easy to confuse flux coming from region i with flux coming from region j. This is because the recovery algorithm can use only sub-observations that contain only one of the regions i, j to distinguish between sources coming from region i and sources coming from region j. The SNR of one sub-observation is lower than the SNR of the reconstructed observation, meaning that statistically significant sources on the reconstructed image might not be significant in one sub-observation. This means that weak (yet statistically significant sources) which are non-significant in a single sub-observation can be mistakenly misplaced to positions with a representing vector which is close to the representing vector of the correct position. Therefore we prefer to choose the representing vectors such that the difference between every pair of vectors is non-zero in at least r coordinates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">|| − → v i − − → v j || 2 ≥ r<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Constructing a set for which conditions <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_22">(3)</ref> hold is non-trivial, and is discussed in section 8.1, we will just remark that it can be done for a multiplexing of N with M ≈ 2log 2 (N ) if we want a robust recovery. In a slightly less robust case, when in the above notation |a 1 −a 2 | √ σ 2 noise +a 1 &gt; γ ≈ 5 (γ is introduced later and is a confidence parameter of the algorithm, this condition means that with high probability there is no confusion between a 1 and a 2 due to noise) then we can use as little as M ≈ log 2 (N ) + log 2 (log 2 (N )) sub-observations for full recovery. On our simple example above, the minimal set that satisfies condition (2) and condition (3) with r = 2 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">V = {(0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0)}</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3.">The charting recovery algorithm</head><p>A detailed description of the charting recovery algorithm can be found in section 8.2, here we show only a simplified conceptual version. The input of this algorithm is − → µ for every pixel position x. The output is the fluxes, a 0 , a 1 , . . . and the locations they are coming from, i 0 , i 1 , . . . contributing to pixel x. Algorithm (with confidence parameter γ)</p><p>1.

This simple algorithm does not treat the case a 1 = a 2 . We note that using the information from neighboring pixels we can easily solve ambiguities rising from the case a 1 = a 2 . The results of employing this algorithm (without using data from neighboring pixels) to real data from GALEX are shown in section 5.</p></div>

This factor is determined by the constraint on E that we compare the time needed for observations with equal SNR. The exposure time factor changes when different noise sources are dominant and for various observing modes (re-observing vs charting), and therefore each case should be handled separately. The efficiency for all cases (assuming condition <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(1)</ref>) is summarized on table 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observing mode \ Dominant noise Poisson Background noise Read-noise</head><p>Re-observing Denote the background noise in observation i coming from region j at pixel x as b i,j <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>, denote the read noise in observation i at pixel x by r i <ref type="bibr">[x]</ref>. We will use the notation P (λ) to denote a Poisson random variable with expectancy λ (where λ is in units of photons). We will assume that all are independent random variables and that the background and read noise have mean 0 and standard deviations σ b , σ r respectively (and otherwise subtract the mean). To calculate the SNR of an observation, assuming that only one region ¯ c contributes non-zero flux g ¯ c to pixel x, lets first look at a specific sub-observation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">K 1 (*) K Charting K 1 (*) K √ log 2 (N ) &lt; E = N K M &lt; K</formula><formula xml:id="formula_28">f i [x] = P ( j∈C i g j [x]T * e ) + j∈C i T * e b i,j [x] + r i [x] = P (g ¯ c T * e ) + j∈C i T * e b i,j [x] + r i [x]</formula><p>For each region ¯ c we have |{i s.t ¯ c ∈ C i }| ≈ M K N (the number of sets C i that contain ¯ c) subobservations containing it (in each sub-observation we observe K parts, there are M such sub-observations and the total number of parts is N ). Assuming the common case that only the region ¯ c contributes non-zero flux to pixel x, the best SNR of region ¯ c is achieved when taking the average of all sub-observations i for which ¯ c ∈ C i , meaning that the best flux estimation of region ¯ c is</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">F ¯ c = {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } P (T * e g ¯ c ) + {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } j∈C i T * e b i,j [x] + {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } r i [x] |{i s.t ¯ c ∈ C i }|</formula><p>Multiplying the signal by a factor does not change the SNR so</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">M K N F ¯ c ≈ |{i s.t ¯ c ∈ C i }|F ¯ c = {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } P (T * e g ¯ c ) + {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } j∈C i T * e b i,j [x] + {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } r i [x] (4)</formula><p>Now, we analyze the efficiency of the method assuming that different parts of the noise are dominant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Poisson noise is dominant</head><p>Assuming Poisson noise is the dominant noise source, we can rewrite equation 4 as</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">M K N F ¯ c ≈ {i s.t ¯ c∈C i } P (T * e g ¯ c ) = P ( M K N T * e g ¯ c )</formula><p>We can choose T * e = N Te M K , so the equation becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">M K N F ¯ c ≈ P ( M K N T * e g ¯ c ) = P (T e g ¯ c )</formula><p>and we get the same SNR as in the original observation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Simulations</head><p>To simulate the operation of the charting algorithm, we performed several simulations using data observed with the GALEX satellite (scanning mode with 80 seconds exposure time). These observations were targeted at high galactic latitude, and therefore were sparse, with a measured P d ≈ 1 1000 allowing for high multiplexing. We used 349 regions, 1000x1000 pixels each. We used our algorithm with K = 175 and M = 18 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). To study the performance of the recovery, we compare the reconstructed image with the original image with added background noise. Each reconstructed sky region is the average of 9 sub-observations in which it is contained. Therefore the theoretical standard deviation of the reconstructed image is σ rec = σ sub √ 9</p><p>. We generated our set V satisfying conditions (2) and (3) with r = 4 (the closest pair of vectors is different in 4 coordinates).</p><p>We report a high fidelity (&gt; 95%) for recovering the correct positions of all the 7σ rec pixels which have flux contribution from 1 source (and &gt; 99% at 8σ rec and above, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>). We also report a high fidelity of recovering the correct combination of pixels with flux contribution of 2 or more sources (&gt; 90% for sources with more than 10σ rec and ∼ 99% for sources with more than 20σ rec ). <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.-Examples of sub-observations using N = 349, K ≈ 175 and M = 18. Notice that some objects appear in both images and some appear in only one of them. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Applications</head><p>There are many possible applications to the multiplexed imaging method, and many scientific missions operating in the visible, UV and IR (from space) can substantially increase their capabilities by using it. High multiplexing may be limited by the observed object density, or by practical/optical reasons. Here we discuss the expected improvements assuming no optical limitations, which will surely arise when designing a multiplexed imaging system with a large number of optical elements. We assume that the object density (P d) can be as low as 1 1000 , and the expected improvement shown below assume this object density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Sky surveys from space</head><p>Multiplexed imaging would be powerful for sky surveys from space because of the combination of the following factors:</p><p>• Detectors are more expensive to operate in space, and the multiplexed imaging system may reduce the amount of expensive space-qualified hardware.</p><p>• The background noise is substantially lower from space than from the ground.</p><p>• There are no atmospheric aberrations, meaning that the PSF when imaging from space is substantially smaller, reducing P d, allowing for higher multiplexing. ≈ 60.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Lucky imaging</head><p>The lucky imaging method is a technique used to decrease the effects of atmospheric aberrations using high frequency imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Law et al. 2006</ref>). When imaging at high frequency, the dominant noise source is the read noise, meaning that high multiplexing might be useful. One should notice that the current charting recovery algorithm will not suffice for this approach, because objects that fall on the same detector area will interfere differently on each sub-observation, as a result of the atmospheric aberrations. Therefore, we must assume that the logical limit set by the object density is lower than the bound we got from the object density, to prevent the interference of objects. Since high-speed detectors are small and expensive, using the multiplexed imaging method the lucky imaging technique may become more useful for imaging larger sky areas. Expected improvement: An increase in the range of 100 fold (assuming we cannot allow colliding sources) to 1000-fold (assuming we can) in the area observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Fast photometry</head><p>Astronomers use high frequency observations (∼ 50Hz) to search for rapid changes in the light flux coming from stars, e.g caused by random occultations by Kuiper belt objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Schlichting et al. 2009</ref>) or by intrinsic changes of the stellar flux (e.g, astro-seismology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cunha et al. 2007)</ref>. In this scientific use, the dominant source of noise is either the read-noise or the Poisson noise, allowing for high multiplexing. Expected improvement: An increase of up to 1000 in the amount of stars we will be able to monitor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Searching for transient sources</head><p>When searching for transients, one seeks the appearance of new objects in the field of view. This means that in principle astronomers try to image as wide an area as possible, observing the same area of sky over and over again. With multiplexed imaging, one can use the re-observing mode. Expected improvement from the ground: From the ground, when the background noise is dominant, multiplexing can help making shallow all-sky surveys 10-fold to 100-fold more effective, increasing the cadence and reducing the efficiency drop due to slew time. When designing new instruments, multiplexed imaging may help reduce the cost of survey telescopes, allowing for the use of smaller detectors, larger f-numbers and reducing the demands from the physical machinery. Expected improvement from space: In this case the dominant noise source is either read-noise or Poisson noise. The expected improvement is up to a factor of 1000.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Searching for planets, eclipsing binaries and micro-lensing events</head><p>These applications involve monitoring bright stars regularly, to detect flux decrements due to occultation of the star by a planet or an increase of flux due to a lensing event. The flux variability scale can be as small as 0.0001%. At these levels of precision the dominant noise is the Poisson noise, allowing for high multiplexing. It will be especially beneficial when making shallow homogeneous searches for planets. Expected Improvement: Improvement factor of up to 1000 when searching non-dense sky areas, and roughly 10 when monitoring dense regions of the sky.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1.">Construction of the sets</head><p>In this section we show how one can construct the set V such that there will be no ambiguity in the recovery of two interfering sources. We will start by noticing a useful fact: gets. This means that we can exactly construct µ as µ = av j + bv l with no confusion, leading to a correct recovery of the indices j, l. In order to construct the set V we will introduce another helpful fact.</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">Claim. Let − → µ</formula><p>Claim. For every pair of binary vectors v = w with equal sum K where K &gt; M/2, all the numbers a, b, a + b appear in the sum a − → v + b − → w .</p><p>Proof. The sum of v + w is 2K which is distributed over M coordinates, and 2K &gt; M meaning v + w contains a coordinate with weight larger than 1, so a − → v + b − → w contains the number a + b. Since v = w there is at least one coordinate where they are different and they both have the same number of 1's, so they must be different on an even number of places, therefore a and b also appear in a − → v + b − → w .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q.E.D</head><p>To assure that all the numbers {a, b, a + b} appear in every combination of av j + bv l for every v j = v l ∈ V we can choose the set V to be a set of binary vectors with equal sum, and which will be chosen to be M K N . We need to have |V | = N , therefore we can determine M by the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">N &lt; M M K N , deriving that M = αlog(N ) + βlog(log(N ))</formula><p>Using an example ratio of K N = 1 2 , we get α = 1, β = 0.5. If we want to recover the position in the situation where a = b (or a and b are indistinguishable due to noise) there needs to be only one way to recover v, w ∈ V from v + w. We may also want to enforce that every pair of vectors are sufficiently distant to help reduce the confusion in the positions of weak sources. Both conditions can be satisfied by constructing the set V from the empty set by inserting vectors with exactly M K N ones in a random order, verifying the condition v 1 + v 2 = w 1 + w 2 for every quadruplet of V and the condition ||v i − v j || ≥ r at every time. Experimentally we got that the achieved M with this process is roughly M ≈ 2log(N ) with r = 4, which is about twice the value of M needed without the above limiting conditions.</p></div>
