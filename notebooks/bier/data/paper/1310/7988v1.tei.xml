			<abstract>
				<p>Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R ⊕) and Neptune (about 4 R ⊕) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars 1,2,3. Most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the planet&apos;s size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet&apos;s mass-and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition-is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4 R ⊕ have proven to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions 4,5 , but these measurements did not extend down to planets as small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours (ref. 6). Given a radius of 1.20 ± 0.09 R ⊕ and mass of 1.69 ± 0.41 M ⊕ , the planet&apos;s mean density of 5.3 ± 1.8 g cm-3 is similar to the Earth&apos;s, suggesting a composition of rock and iron. Kepler-78 is one of approximately 150,000 stars whose brightness was precisely measured at 30-minute intervals for four years by the NASA Kepler spacecraft 7. This star is somewhat smaller, less massive, and younger than the Sun (Table 1). Every 8.5 hours the star&apos;s brightness declines by 0.02% as the planet Kepler-78b transits (passes in front of) the stellar disk. The planet&apos;s radius was originally measured 6 to be 1.16 !!.!&quot; !!.!&quot; R ⊕. The mass could not be measured, although masses &gt;8 M ⊕ could be ruled out because the planet&apos;s gravity would have deformed the star and produced brightness variations that were not detected. We measured the mass of Kepler-78b by tracking the line-of-sight component of the host star&apos;s motion (the radial velocity, RV) due to the gravitational force of the planet. The RV analysis is challenging not only because the signal is expected to be small (~1-3 m s-1) but also because the apparent Doppler shifts due to rotating starspots are much larger (~50 m s-1 peak-to-peak). Nevertheless the detection proved to be possible, thanks to the precisely known orbital period and phase of Kepler-78b that cleanly separated the timescale of spot variations (P rot ≈ 12.5 days) from the much shorter timescale of the planetary orbit (P ≈ 8.5 hours). We adopted a strategy of intensive Doppler measurements spanning 6-8 hours per night, long enough to cover nearly the entire orbit and short enough for the spot variations to be nearly frozen out. We measured RVs using optical spectra of Kepler-78 that we obtained from the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) 8 on the 10-m Keck I Telescope. These Doppler shifts were computed relative to a template spectrum with a standard algorithm 9 that uses a spectrum of molecular iodine superposed on the stellar spectrum as a reference for the wavelength scale and instrumental profile of HIRES (Supplementary Table 1). Exposures lasted 15-30 minutes depending on conditions and produced RVs with 1.5-2.0 m s-1 uncertainties. The time series of RVs spans 38 days, with large velocity offsets between nights due to spots (Fig. 1). Within each night the RVs vary by typically 2-4 m s-1 and show coherence on shorter time scales. We modeled the RV time series as the sum of two components. One component was a sinusoidal function representing orbital motion (assumed to be circular). The orbital period and phase were held fixed at the photometrically-determined values; the only free parameters were the Doppler amplitude K, an arbitrary RV zero point, and a velocity &apos;jitter&apos; term σ jitter to account for additional RV noise. The second component of the model, representing the spot variations, was the sum of three sinusoidal functions with periods P rot , P rot /2, and P rot /3. The amplitudes and phases of the sinusoids and P rot were free parameters. All together there were 10 parameters and 77 data points. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample the allowed combinations of the model parameters, we found K = 1.66 ± 0.40 m s-1 , corresponding to M pl = 1.69 ± 0.41 M ⊕ (Fig. 1). This planet mass is consistent with an independent measurement using the HARPS-N spectrometer 10. Several tests were performed to gauge the robustness of the spot model. First, we varied the number of harmonics, checking at each stage whether any improvement in the fit was statistically significant. The three-term model was found to provide significant improvement over one-term and two-term models, but additional harmonics beyond P rot /3 did not provide significant improvement. Second, we used a different spot model in which the spot-induced variation was taken to be a linear function of time specific to each night. The constant and slope of each nightly function were free parameters. With this model we found M pl = 1.50 ± 0.44 M ⊕ , consistent with the preceding results (see Methods and Extended Data Figure 3). The larger uncertainty can be attributed to the greater flexibility of this piecewise-linear spot model, which permits discontinuous and probably unphysical variations between consecutive nights. Kepler-78b is now the smallest exoplanet for which both the mass and radius are known accurately (Fig. 2), extending the domain of such measurements into the neighborhood of Earth and Venus. Kepler-78b is 20% larger than Earth and is 69% more massive, suggesting commonality with the other low-mass planets (4-8 M ⊕) below the rock composition contour in Fig. 2b. They are all consistent with rock/iron compositions and negligible atmospheres. We explored some possibilities for the interior structure of Kepler-78b using a simplified two-component model 11 consisting of an iron core surrounded by a silicate mantle (Mg 2 SiO 4). This model correctly reproduces the masses of Earth and Venus given their radii and assuming a composition of 67% silicate rock and 33% iron by mass. Applied to Kepler-78b, the model gives an iron fraction of 20% ± 33%, similar to that of Earth and Venus but smaller than that of Mercury (≈60%, [12]). With a star-planet separation of 0.01 astronomical units (the Earth-Sun distance, AU), the dayside of Kepler-78b is heated to a temperature of 2300-3100 K. Any gaseous atmosphere around Kepler-78b would probably have been long ago lost to photoevaporation by the intense starlight 13. However, based on the measured surface gravity of 11 m s-2 , the liquid and solid portions of the planet should be stable against mass loss of the sort 14 that is apparently destroying the smaller planet KIC 12557548b 15. Kelper-78b is a member of an emerging class of planets with orbital periods of less than half a day 6,16,17. Another member is KOI 1843.03 (refs. 18,19), which has been shown to have a high density (≳7 g cm-3), although the deduction in that case was based on the theoretical requirement to avoid tidal destruction rather than direct measurement. That planet&apos;s minimum density is similar to our estimated density for Kepler-78b (5.3 !!.! !!.! g cm-3). These two planets provide a stark contrast to Kepler-11f, which has a similar mass to Kepler-78b, but a density that is 10 times smaller 20. With only a handful of low-mass planets with measured densities known (Fig. 2b), we see solid planets primarily in highly irradiated, close-in orbits and low-density planets swollen by thick atmospheres in somewhat cooler orbits. Measurements of additional planet masses and radii are needed to assess the significance of this pattern. Additional ultrashort period planets with detectable Doppler amplitudes (K ∝ P-1/3) have been identified by the Kepler mission and are ripe for mass measurements. With an ensemble of future measurements, the masses and radii of ultrashort period planets may reveal a commonality or diversity of density and composition. This knowledge of hot solid planets may be relevant to problems such as the interiors of cooler extrasolar planets with atmospheres, the range of core sizes in giant planet formation, and Mercury&apos;s unusually high iron abundance. Methods Summary: We fit Keck-HIRES spectra of Kepler-78 with stellar atmosphere models using the Spectroscopy Made Easy software package to measure the star&apos;s temperature, gravity, and iron abundance. These spectroscopic parameters were used to estimate the host star&apos;s mass, radius, and density-crucial parameters to determine the planet&apos;s mass, radius, and density-from empirical relationships calibrated by precisely characterized binary star systems. Using this stellar density as a constraint, we reanalyzed the Kepler photometry to refine the planet radius measurement. We observed Kepler-78 with HIRES using standard procedures including sky spectrum subtraction and wavelength calibration with a reference iodine spectrum. We measured high-precision relative RVs using a forward model where the de-convolved stellar spectrum is Doppler shifted, multiplied by the normalized high-resolution iodine transmission spectrum, convolved with an instrumental profile, and matched to the observed spectra using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that minimizes the χ 2 statistic. The time series RVs on eight nights were analyzed with several parametric models to account for the small-amplitude, periodic signal from the orbiting planet and the larger amplitude, quasi-periodic apparent Doppler shifts due to rotating starspots. In our adopted harmonic spot model the starspot signal was modeled as a sum of sine functions whose amplitudes and phases were free parameters. We sampled the multi-dimensional model parameter space with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate parameter confidence intervals and to account for covariance between parameters. We found multiple families of models that add described the data well and they gave consistent measures of the Doppler amplitude, which is proportional to the mass of Kepler-78b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>Stellar Characterization. We fit three Keck-HIRES spectra of Kepler-78 with stellar atmosphere models using Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME 26 ). The spectra have per-pixel signalto-noise ratios of 220 at 550 nm. We used the standard wavelength intervals, line data, and methodology <ref type="bibr">27</ref> . Kepler-78 does not have a measured parallax to constrain luminosity and gravity. The initial analysis gave an effective temperature T eff = 5119 ± 44 K, gravity log g = 4.751 ± 0.060 (cgs), iron abundance [Fe/H] = -0.054 ± 0.040 dex, and projected rotational velocity Vsini = 2.2 ± 0.5 km s -1 . These values are the mean of the SME results for the three spectra and the error bars are limited by systematics <ref type="bibr">27</ref> . Because this combination of T eff and log g is inconsistent with the Dartmouth stellar evolutionary model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , we recomputed stellar parameters with log g fixed at the value model-predicted by a stellar model at the value of T eff from SME giving the stellar parameters in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref>. Note that adopted Vsini = 2.6 ± 0.5 km s -1 is consistent with an expectation based on a stellar rotation, size, and an equatorial viewing geometry: Vsini ≈ V rot ≈ 2πR star /P rot = 3.0 km s -1 .</p><p>We estimated the stellar mass and radius using empirical relationships 23 based on non-interacting binary systems that parameterize R star and M star as functions of log g, T eff , and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. We propagated the errors on the three SME-derived inputs to obtain R star = 0.74 ± 0.05 R sun and M star = 0.83 ± 0.05 M sun . The M star uncertainty comes from the 6% fractional scatter in the mass-radius relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . We adopt these values when computing R pl and M pl . We checked for selfconsistency of the empirical calibration by computing log g from the derived R star and M star , giving log g = 4.62 ± 0.06 (cgs).</p><p>As a consistency check, we explored two additional estimates of stellar parameters. First, the mass and radius from an evolutionary track in the Dartmouth model (1 Gyr, [m/H] = 0) that match our adopted T eff and log g values are R star = 0.77 ± 0.04 R sun and M star = 0.85 ± 0.05 M sun . These values are consistent with our adopted results. Second, we used a recent study 28 of stellar angular diameters that parameterized R star as a function of T eff . This gives R star = 0.77 ± 0.03 R sun , where the uncertainty is the median absolute deviation on the calibration star radii.</p><p>We note that Kepler-78 has remarkably similar properties to the transiting planet host star HD 189733. These properties <ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">30</ref> include T eff = 5040 K, log g = 4.587 (cgs), R star = 0.76 R sun and M star = 0.81 M sun , log R' HK = -4.50, and P rot = 11.9 days. HD 189733 has spot-induced RV variations 31 of ~15 m s -1 (rms).</p><p>The rotation period of Kepler-78 was previously measured to be 12.5 ± 1.0 days 6 . Using a relationship 31 between age, mass, and rotation period, we estimate an age of 750 ± 150 Myr. The stellar age can also be estimated from the stellar magnetic activity measured by the S HK index. We computed the spectral-type-independent activity index, log R' HK , for all HIRES observations of this star and found a median value of -4.52 with a 1-σ range of ±0.03. The computation made use of an estimated B-V = 0.873, converted 9 from T eff . This level of activity is consistent with the value for stars in the 625 Myr old Hyades cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">32</ref> . We also constrained the age by searching for the age-sensitive Li I absorption line at 6708 Å. Lithium is depleted relatively quickly in stars of this spectral type owing to convective mixing. Based on Li I measurements in three clusters with known ages 33 , our non-detection (Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) suggests an age greater than ~500 Myr. These three ages are self-consistent. We adopt an age of 625 Myr with an approximate age uncertainty of 150 Myr. We expect a star of this age and activity to have spots that cause RV variations at the &gt; 10 m s -1 level.</p><p>Transit analysis. Transit parameters are crucial to estimate the planet radius, which in turn affects our ability to estimate the composition of the planet. These parameters were measured previously with the discovery of Kepler-78b 6 . In that study the impact parameter b was nearly unconstrained because the 30 min average of the Kepler long-cadence data cannot resolve the transit ingress time. This leads to an increased uncertainty on transit depth due to the stellar limb darkening profile. We constrained the transit parameters using the stellar density (ρ star ) obtained from the spectroscopic analysis. Assuming a circular orbit,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ star = (3π/GP 2 ) (a/R star ) 3 ,</formula><p>where a/R star is the scaled semi-major axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">34</ref> . This gives a/R star = 2.7 ± 0.2, a much tighter constraint than from the transit light curve alone (a/R star = 3.0 !!.! !!.!</p><p>).</p><p>Aside from this additional constraint, our transit analysis is similar to the one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In brief, we analyzed the Kepler long-cadence data from Q1 through Q15 (a total of 3.7 years of nearly continuous observations) to construct a filtered, phase-folded light curve with a final cadence of 2 minutes. The light curve is modeled with a combination of a transit model 35 , a model for the out-of-transit modulations, and an occultation model. The most relevant transit parameters are the impact parameter, the ratio of stellar radius to orbital distance, and the zero-limb-darkening transit depth. The model is calculated with a cadence of 15 seconds and averaged over the 30 minute cadence of Kepler. In this new analysis, R star /a is subjected to a Gaussian prior (2.7 ± 0.2), which leads to a well-measured impact parameter and a reduced uncertainty for the transit depth. We found the best-fit solution and explored parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.

Error bars encompass 68.3% confidence intervals. Parameter correlations are plotted in Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. These values are compatible with the previous estimate that was not constrained by ρ star <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Radial Velocity Measurements. We observed Kepler-78 with the HIRES echelle spectrometer 8 on the 10-m Keck I telescope using standard procedures. Observations were made with the C2 decker (14 x 0.86 arcseconds). This slit is long enough to simultaneously record spectra of Kepler-78 and the faint night sky. We subtracted the sky spectra from the spectra of Kepler-78 during the spectral reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">36</ref> .</p><p>Light from the telescope passed through a glass cell of molecular iodine cell heated to 50° C. The dense set of molecular absorption lines imprinted on the stellar spectra in 5000-6200 Å provide a robust wavelength scale against which Doppler shifts are measured, as well as strong constraints on the instrumental profile at the time of each observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">38</ref> . We also obtained three iodinefree "template" spectra of Kepler-78 using the B3 decker (14 x 0.57 arcseconds). These spectra were used to measure stellar parameters, as described above. One of them was de-convolved using the instrumental profile measured from spectra of rapidly rotating B stars observed immediately before and after. This de-convolved spectrum served as a "template" for the Doppler analysis.</p><p>The HIRES observations span 38 days. On eight nights we observed Kepler-78 intensively, covering 6-8 hours per night. We also gathered a single spectrum on six additional nights to monitor the RV variations from spots. These once-per-night RVs were not used to determine the planetary mass and are shown in Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> but not in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>We measured high-precision relative RVs using a forward model where the de-convolved stellar spectrum is Doppler shifted, multiplied by the normalized high-resolution iodine transmission spectrum, convolved with an instrumental profile, and matched to the observed spectra using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that minimizes the χ 2 statistic 9 . In this algorithm, the RV is varied (along with nuisance parameters describing the wavelength scale and instrumental profile) until the χ 2 minimum is reached.</p><p>The times of observation (in heliocentric Julian days, HJD), RVs relative to an arbitrary zero point, and error estimates are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Supplementary Table 1</ref> and plotted in Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Each RV error is the standard error on the mean RV of ~700 spectral chunks (each spanning ~2 Å) that are separately Doppler analyzed. These error estimates do not account for systematic Doppler shifts from instrumental or stellar effects. We also measured the S HK index for each HIRES spectrum. This index measures the strength of the inversion cores of the Ca II H &amp; K absorption lines and correlates with stellar magnetic activity 39 .</p><p>We measured the absolute RV of Kepler-78 relative to the Solar System barycenter using telluric sky lines as a reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">40</ref> . The distribution of telluric RVs has a median value of -3.59 km s -1 and a standard deviation of 0.10 k s -1 .</p><p>Harmonic RV Spot Model. Kepler-78 is young active star, as demonstrated by the large stellar flux variations observed with Kepler. A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> measured P rot = 12.5 ± 1.0 days using a Lomb Scargle periodogram of the photometry. Inspection of the RVs measured over one month indeed show some repeatability with a timescale of ~12-13 days, a sign that starspots are also inducing a large RV signal (see Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">41</ref> , we modeled the RV signal induced by spots with a primary sine function at the rotation period of the star, followed by a series of sine functions representing subharmonics of the stellar rotation. The planet-induced RV signal is modeled with a sinusoid, assuming zero eccentricity and using a linear ephemeris fixed to the best-fit orbital period and phase 6 . The final model for the RV at time t is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">RV(t) = -K sin (2π (t-t c )/P) + γ + í µí± ! ! sin(φ i + i 2 π t / P rot )</formula><p>where K is the semi-amplitude of the planet-induced RV signal, t c is a time of transit, P is the orbital period, i runs from 1 to N, where N is the number of subharmonics used, P rot is the rotation period, and finally a i and φ i are the two parameters added for each of the N subharmonics. The amplitude a i is always chosen to be positive, and φ i is constrained to be positive and smaller than 2π. The time t was set to zero at 2456446 in HJD format. P and t c were held fixed to their photometrically determined values <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 1)</ref>. K was free to take on positive and negative values to prevent a bias toward larger planet mass.</p><p>We used the Bayesian Information Criterion to choose the appropriate number of subharmonics. This criterion states that for each additional model parameter the standard χ 2 function should decrease by at least ln(N meas ) in order to be deemed statistically significant. In our case N meas = 77 (the number of RVs on the eight nights with intensive observations). For each subharmonic added, the best-fit χ 2 should decrease by at least 8.7 for the more complex model to be justified. The best-fit χ 2 values for N = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 1822, 262, 163, 161, and 158, respectively. We used a Gaussian prior to control the rotation period in this analysis to select the number of harmonics. We adopted the N = 3 model because adding additional subharmonics is not statistically justified. This analysis does not rule out the possibility that non-consecutive subharmonics provide a better fit to the data. We checked that for a model with three subharmonics chosen from the first four, the first three subharmonics is the best combination. We also checked that choosing only two subharmonics out of the first four was never a better option than using the first three.</p><p>Using the spot model with the first three subharmonics, we used an MCMC algorithm to explore model parameter space. We added an RV "jitter" term σ jitter to account for the high value of the reduced χ 2 in the best-fit model without jitter (a value of 2.1), following a standard procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">42</ref> to leave it as a free parameter. We maximized the logarithm of the likelihood function instead of minimizing the χ 2 function. We estimate the parameters describing the planet be K = 1.66 ± 0. , and φ 3 = 0.48 ± 0.21. These values are the median and 68.3% confidence regions of marginalized posterior distributions from the MCMC analysis. In this final run, P rot was not subject to a prior and yet the value is compatible with the photometric estimate. Our estimate of K is inconsistent with zero at the 4-σ level. This 4-σ detection of Kepler-78b that is consistent with the orbital period and phase from Kepler gives us high confidence that we have detected the planet. The planet mass listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref> was computed from the values for K, P, i, and M star with the assumption of a circular orbit.</p><p>We searched for additional χ 2 minima to assess the sensitivity of our mass measurement to the spot model. We found a second family of solutions with K = 1.85 ± 0.43 m s -1 , σ jitter = 2.3 ± 0.3 m s -1 , and P rot = 12.3 days. While our adopted solution with P rot = 12.8 days is clearly preferred by the χ 2 criterion (χ 2 = 163 versus 180), the broader model search demonstrates that our mass determination is relatively insensitive to details of the spot model. We also calculated the K values with different combinations of two and three harmonics. For example, a model with the first, second, and fourth harmonic gives K = 1.78 ± 0.45 m s -1 , with a slightly larger σ jitter = 2.3 ± 0.3 m s -1 . A model with the first four harmonics gives K = 1.77 ± 0.41 m s -1 , with σ jitter = 2.2 ± 0.3 m s -1 . Second, we included all of the RVs (including the six RVs measured on nights without intensive observations) and fitted the complete data set with three and four consecutive harmonics, giving K = 1.80 ± 0.43 m s -1 and σ jitter = 2.4 ± 0.3 m s -1 for the three harmonics model, and K = 1.77 ± 0.41 m s -1 and σ jitter = 2.2 ± 0.3 m s -1 with four harmonics. While the coefficients and phases of the sine functions changed with each test, K remained compatible with the value from our adopted model. We also checked that K is not correlated with any other model parameters in the MCMC distribution.</p><p>We estimate the probability that RV noise fluctuations conspired to produce an apparently coherent signal with the precise period and phase of Kepler-78b to be approximately one in 16,000. This is the probability of a 4-σ outlier for a normally distributed random variable. We adopt 4-σ because the fractional error on K is approximately 4. Note that this is not the false alarm probability (FAP) commonly computed for new Doppler detections of exoplanets. In those cases one must search over a wide range of orbital periods and phases to detect the planet, and also measure the planet's mass. Here the existence of the planet was already well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Our job was to measure the planet's mass given knowledge of its orbit.</p><p>Offset-slope RV Spot Model. To gauge the sensitivity of our results to model assumptions, we considered a second RV model. Like the harmonic spot model, the offset-slope model consists of two components. The Doppler signal from the planet is a sinusoidal function of time with the period and phase held fixed at the values from the photometric analysis. The spot variations are approximated as linear functions of time with slopes and offsets specific to each night, providing much greater model flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">43</ref> . This model for the RV at time t on night n is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">RV(t) = -K sin (2 π (t-t c ) / P ) + γ n + í µí»¾ ! (t -t n ),</formula><p>where γ n is an RV offset, í µí»¾ ! is an RV slope (velocity per unit time), and t n is the median time of observation specific to night n. The other symbols have the same meanings as above. As with the previous model, an RV jitter term was added in quadrature to the errors and P and t c were fixed <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 1)</ref>. Altogether, the offset-slope model contains 18 free parameters.</p><p>We used an MCMC algorithm to explore the model parameter space. The best-fit model and randomly selected models from the MCMC chain are shown in Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The key result is K = 1.53 ± 0.45 m s -1 , which is consistent with the value from the harmonic spot model. The lower precision of the offset-slope model (3.4-σ vs. 4.1-σ significance) results from greater model flexibility. The slopes and offsets on nearby nights are not constrained to produce continuous spot variations as a function of time. For this reason we adopt the harmonic spot model.</p><p>As an additional test of the sensitivity to model details, we used the offset-slope framework to model a subset of the RVs. Within each night, we selected the median values from each group of three RVs ordered in time. This selection naturally rejects outlier RVs and matches the observing style on nights 2-8 when three groups of three measurements were made as close as possible to orbital quadratures (maximum or minimum RV). (On night 8, the final group of RVs only has two measurements; we used the mean of those two RVs for this test.) Our MCMC analysis of these median RVs gave a similar result, K = 1.26 ± 0.38 m s -1 , that is consistent with the above results at the ~1-σ level. We conclude that our detection of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-78</ref> is not strongly sensitive to spot model assumptions or to individual RV measurements.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">44</ref> . Additional iron and calcium lines are labeled.</p></div>
