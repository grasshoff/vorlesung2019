			<abstract>
				<p>The Kepler-11 planetary system contains six transiting planets ranging in size from 1.8 to 4.2 times the radius of Earth. Five of these planets orbit in a tightly-packed configuration with periods between 10 and 47 days. We perform a dynamical analysis of the system based upon transit timing variations observed in more than three years of Kepler photometric data. Stellar parameters are derived using a combination of spectral classification and constraints on the star&apos;s density derived from transit profiles together with planetary eccentricity vectors provided by our dynamical study. Combining masses of the planets relative to the star from our dynamical study and radii of the planets relative to the star from transit depths together with deduced stellar properties yields measurements of the radii of all six planets, masses of the five inner planets, and an upper bound to the mass of the outermost planet, whose orbital period is 118 days. We find mass-radius combinations for all six planets that imply that substantial fractions of their volumes are occupied by constituents that are less dense than rock. Moreover, we examine the stability of these envelopes against photo-evaporation and find that the compositions of at least the inner two planets have likely been significantly sculpted by mass loss. The Kepler-11 system contains the lowest mass exoplanets for which both mass and radius have been measured.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Within our Solar System, Earth and smaller bodies are primarily rocky (or, far from the Sun, mixtures of rock and ices), whereas the cosmically-abundant low-density constituents H 2 and He dominate the volume in Uranus/Neptune and larger bodies. There are no local examples of bodies intermediate in size or mass between Earth (1 R ⊕ , 1 M ⊕ ) and Uranus/Neptune, both of which are larger than 3.8 R ⊕ and more massive than 14 M ⊕ . However, observations of extrasolar planets are now filling this gap in our knowledge of the mass-radius relationship of planetary bodies.</p><p>To date, the only accurate radius measurements for exoplanets have been provided by planets observed to transit across the disk of their star. The fractional depth of the transit provides a direct measure for the ratio of the radius of the planet to that of its star. The star's radius is estimated using spectroscopic classification, in some cases augmented by other techniques.</p><p>Doppler measurements of the variation of a star's radial velocity have been used to compute mass estimates for almost two hundred transiting giant planets, as well as for the first three sub-Uranus exoplanets for which both radii and masses were determined: GJ 1214 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charbonneau et al. 2009</ref>), CoRoT-7 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Queloz et al. 2009</ref>), and Kepler-10 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>). Analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs) resulting from mutual planetary perturbations provided dynamical estimates of the masses of the five innermost known planets orbiting <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>), more than doubling the number of exoplanets less massive than Uranus with both size and mass measurements. Precise mass estimates have subsequently been obtained for several more sub-Uranus mass planets, in three cases by using radial velocity (RV): 55 Cancre e ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Winn et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Endl et al. 2012</ref>), <ref type="bibr">Kepler-20 b (Gautier et al. 2012</ref>), and GJ 3470 b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bonfils et al. 2012</ref>); three using TTVs: <ref type="bibr">Kepler-36 b,c (Carter et al. 2012</ref>), and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-30 b (Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2012</ref>);</p><p>and one, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-18 b (Cochran et al. 2011</ref>), using a combination of RV and TTV data. Less precise estimates for the masses of dozens of Kepler planets and planet candidates, many of which are in this mass range, have been derived from TTVs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lissauer et al. (2011a)</ref> estimated the masses of the five planets Kepler-11 b-f using only the first 16 months of Kepler data. Similar mass constraints on these planets, as well as an upper limit of 30 M ⊕ on the mass of the outer planet Kepler-11 g, were obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Migaszewski et al. (2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Migaszewski et al. (2012)</ref> analyzed the same Q1-Q6 1 data using a photodynamical model, which adjusted planetary parameters (size, orbital elements, masses) to minimize the residuals of a fit of a model lightcurve that accounts for mutual planetary interactions to the measured lightcurve.</p><p>We report herein more precise estimates of the masses of the six Kepler-11 planets derived from TTV measurements that incorporate 40 months of Kepler photometric time series data.</p><p>In Section 2, we present our estimates of transit times; detailed descriptions of the three independent techniques used to compute these times are given in Appendix A. Our dynamical analysis of the Kepler-11 system based upon these transit times is presented in Section 3, with additional information provided in Appendix B. In Section 4, we combine estimates of stellar density obtained using transit profiles and the dynamical measurement of planetary eccentricities presented in Section 3 together with analyses of high-resolution spectra taken at the Keck I telescope to provide refined parameters for the star <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11</ref>. We tabulate the properties of Kepler-11's six known planets that are derived by combining lightcurve analysis with our dynamical results and stellar parameters in Section 5, wherein we also discuss implications of these results for planetary compositions. We conclude the paper with a summary of our principal results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Measurement of Transit Times from Kepler Photometric Time Series</head><p>Variations in the brightness of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11</ref> have been monitored with an effective duty cycle exceding 90% starting at barycentric Julian date (BJD) 2454964.512, with all data returned to Earth at a cadence of 29.426 minutes (long cadence, LC); data have also been returned at a cadence of 58.85 seconds (short cadence, SC) since BJD 2455093.216. Our analysis uses short tions. The Kepler orbital period is ∼372 days, and the data are grouped according to the "quarter" year during which observations were made. The data on Kepler-11 taken prior to Kepler 's first "roll" are referred to as Q1. Subsequent quarters are numbered sequentially: Q2, Q3, ... cadence data where available, augmented by the long cadence dataset primarily during the epoch prior to BJD 2455093.216, for which no SC data were returned to Earth. We obtained these data from the publicly-accessible MAST archive at http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/ .</p><p>As measurement of transit times (TTs) requires a complicated analysis of often noisy data, authors Jason Rowe (J.R.), Eric Agol (E.A.) and Donald Short (D.S.) performed independent measurements of TTs using techniques described in Appendix A. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the deviations of all three sets of observed transit times, O, relative to time from a linear ephemeris fit, C l , through Q14 Kepler data. Here and throughout we base our timeline for transit data from JD-2,454,900.</p><p>As evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, each set of TT measurements contain several outliers. These outliers are unlikely to be correct, and may be due to overlapping transits, star spots, or uncertain fits to the lightcurve. Trying to fit these outlier TTs would degrade our dynamical studies. Therefore, we remove points where only one of the methods yields a TT whose uncertainty is more than 2.5 times as large as the median TT uncertainty computed by that method for the planet in question. We then use the three sets of measured TTs to filter out unreliable measurements as follows: If two or three sets of measurements are available for a specific transit and each of the 1σ uncertainty ranges overlap with at least one of the other ranges, then each of the points are used.</p><p>If there is only a single measurement, or if there is no overlap of 1σ uncertainty ranges, then all measurements of this transit are discarded. If three measurements are available, and two overlap but the third does not overlap with either, then the data are discarded for TTs of planets b -f, but the two overlapping points are retained for planet g, which has far fewer transits observed than any other planet (and no significant TTVs even with these points included). This culling procedure removed fewer than 8% of detected transit times from each dataset, with the most points discarded from Kepler-11 b, whose transits are the most numerous and have the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For planet b, we removed 17 of the 103 TTs measured by E.A., 9 of the 111 TTs measured by J.R., and 13 of the 90 TTs measured by D.S. Our approach is conservative in the sense that the data set used for our dynamical studies presented in Section 3 consists only of transit times that are corroborated by at least one alternative method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Dynamical Models of the Kepler-11 Planetary System</head><p>Transits of a planet on a keplerian orbit about its star must be strictly periodic. In contrast, the gravitational interactions among planets in a multiple planet system cause orbits to speed up and slow down by small amounts, leading to deviations from exact periodicity of transits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dobrovolskis &amp; Borucki 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holman &amp; Murray 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref>). Such variations are strongest when planetary orbital periods are commensurate or nearly so, which is the case for the large planets <ref type="bibr">Kepler-9 b and c (Holman et al. 2010</ref>), or when planets orbit close to one another, which is the case for the inner five transiting planets of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>).</p><p>To integrate planetary motions, we adopt the 8th order Runge-Kutta Prince-Dormand method, which has 9th order errors. Our choice of dynamical epoch was T 0 = 680 days, near the midpoint of the fourteen quarters of Kepler data being modeled. In all of our simulations, the orbital period and phase of each planet are free parameters. The phase is specified by the midpoint of the first transit subsequent to our chosen epoch. Initially, we keep all planetary masses as free parameters.</p><p>In some cases, we required planets to be on circular orbits at epoch, whereas in others we allowed the orbits to be eccentric.</p><p>We have assumed co-planarity, i.e., negligible mutual inclinations between planetary orbits, in all of our dynamical models. We make no attempt to model transit durations or impact parameters in our dynamical simulations.</p><p>Our integrations produce an ephemeris of simulated transit times, C s , and we compare these simulated times to the observed TTs. We employ the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to search for a local minimum in χ 2 . The algorithm evaluates the local slope and curvature of the χ 2 surface. calculated using a linear fit to each set of transit data, i.e., a fit that assumes strictly periodic orbits.</p><p>All measured TTs are displayed, apart from one outlier for Kepler-11 d that deviated from both of the other estimates and a linear ephemeris by more than three hours. Note that the vertical scales differ among panels.</p><p>-8 -Once it obtains a minimum, the curvature of the surface is used to evaluate error bars. Other parameters are allowed to float when determining the error limits on an individual parameter's error bars. Assuming that the χ 2 surface is parabolic in the vicinity of its local minimum, its contours are concentric ellipses centered at the best-fit value. The orientations of these ellipses depend on correlations between parameters. The errors that we quote account for the increase in uncertainty in some dimensions due to such correlations.</p><p>We adopted a wide variety of initial conditions for comparison, and found that our solutions were insensitive to the mass of the outer planet, Kepler-11 g. Hence for all subsequent simulations used to determine the masses and orbital parameters of the five inner planets, we keep the mass of</p><p>Kepler-11 g as a fixed parameter set to 2.53 × 10 −5 M ⋆ (comparable to the masses of similar size planets in this system and equal to 8 M ⊕ for the value of stellar mass estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>), with its orbital eccentricity fixed at zero. We find that the masses and orbital parameters of Our dynamical fitting of the planetary parameters minimizes residuals by adjusting parameters to search for a best-fit, which is determined by a local minimum value of χ 2 .</p><p>Uncertainties are based on the assumption that the shape of the χ 2 surface is well-approximated by local gradients near the minimum, i.e., is shaped like a parabola. For multi-variate problems such as this, the dimensionality of phase space is large, and multiple minima typically exist.</p><p>Furthermore, the low S/N of some lightcurves, particularly, Kepler-11 b, makes the χ 2 surface fairly rough, with many local minima. Thus, the minimum that the code finds need not be the global minimum, i.e., the best fit to the data. And even if it does converge to the global minimum, parameters that yield other minima with χ 2 only slightly larger than that of the global minimum are almost as likely to approximate well the true parameters of the system as are those of the global minimum. To qualitatively account for the increased uncertainty caused by these concerns,  The right hand side plots the residuals of the fit (i.e., the dynamical model subtracted from the observed transit times). Note the differences between the vertical scales of the various panels.     we combined the solutions with the three data sets by averaging their nominal values and defining error bars such that they extend over the entire range given by the union of the 1σ confidence intervals of all three solutions; error bars are thus asymmetric. Note that this gives fairly large ranges, and thus more conservative values than standard 1σ ranges -this is to compensate for shortcomings of Levenberg-Marquardt fitting of such a complex multi-parameter space.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Planet P (days) T 0 (date) e cos ω e sin ω M p /M ⋆ × 10 −</formula><p>The principal results of our dynamical analysis are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. These dynamical measurements are combined with estimates of the star's mass and radius to yield measurements of the planetary characteristics that we present in Section 5. We also performed fits to each of the three sets of TTs in which both the eccentricity and the mass of Kepler-11 g were allowed to float, as well as fits in which the mass of planet g was a free parameter but it was constrained to be on a circular orbit. In all six cases, the fits converged to values similar to those in our fits with planet g on a circular orbit at the nominal mass, albeit with large uncertainties in g's mass. When the eccentricity of planet g was allowed to float, all six fits were inferior (in a χ 2 /d.o.f. sense, where d.o.f. stands for degrees of freedom) to fits with g's parameters fixed.</p><p>To constrain the mass of Kepler-11 g, we performed a suite of simulations using the same initial conditions as our best fit to each set of transits times (see <ref type="table">Tables 6, 7, 8)</ref>. Eccentricities for all planets except g were allowed to float in these fits, but g's eccentricity was always fixed at zero, since eccentricity and mass are inversely correlated and our goal is to determine an upper bound on Kepler-11 g's mass. For each simulation, the mass of planet g was fixed, but since we are comparing simulations with differing masses of planet g, we are effectively allowing this parameter to vary, thereby adding one degree of freedom above those in our best fit models. The F-ratio, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F − ratio = ∆χ 2 /∆(d.o.f.) χ 2 /(d.o.f.) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>describes the likelihood that a change in the minimum of χ 2 could happen by chance given a change in the number of degrees of freedom, in our case, by varying the (fixed for any given run but changed from one run to another) the mass of Kepler-11 g between fits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows the change in χ 2 with variations in the mass of planet g.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We have performed an updated analysis of the Kepler-11 planetary system, concentrating on the dynamical interactions evident in transit timing variations observed in the first 40 months of Kepler photometric data. We have also improved our estimates of the characteristics of the star by combining stellar density constraints from transit profiles and dynamical measurements of planetary eccentricity with spectral information obtained at the Keck observatory. Our updated transit, stellar and planetary parameters are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 2, 3</ref> and 4, respectively.</p><p>cadence photometric measurements, respectively.</p><p>The data were initially detrended using a running 2-day box-car median filter that was applied to individual segments of time-series photometry. A segment was defined as a continuous string of time-series data that does not contain an interruption longer than 2.5 hours (5 long cadence measurements). This was done to handle offsets observed after data outages, typically caused by a change in the thermal environment of the CCD detector. A circular quadratic transit model based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> was fit to the data by minimization of χ 2 with a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The transit model was used to measure the transit duration for each transiting planet. The original SAP_FLUX photometric data were then reprocessed using a second-order polynomial to detrend the time-series to remove instrumental (such as focus changes) and astrophysical effects. All data obtained during transit were excluded, as well as those taken in the 30 minutes before ingress and in the 30 minutes after egress. A clipping algorithm was used to exclude any measurement that differed from the mean by more than 3σ.</p><p>Measurements obtained during a planet transit were excluded from the clipping exercise. It was found that the data before a data outage near JD = 2455593 could not be sufficiently detrended.</p><p>As such, data from 2455593 to 2455594.5 were excluded, which meant that a transit of Kepler-11</p><p>g was not included in our analysis.</p><p>The detrended LC and SC photometric time-series were then each fit with a multi-planet, circular orbit, quadratic Mandel &amp; Agol transit model. The model parameters are the mean stellar density (ρ ⋆ ), photometric zero point, and, for each planet, the center of transit time, orbital period, impact parameter, and scaled planetary radius (R p /R ⋆ ). The model assumes that the mass of star is much greater than the combined mass of the orbiting planets, so that a R ⋆ 3 3π</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">GP 2 = (M ⋆ + M p ) 4π 3 R 3 ⋆ ≈ ρ ⋆ .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A photometric time-series for each transiting planet was then produced by removing the transits of the other transiting planets. The remaining transits were then individually fit by using -31 -the best-fit model as a template and only allowing the center of transit time to vary. This yielded a time-series of transit timing variations (TTVs) for each planet. The measured TTVs were then used to linearize (or deTTV) the photometry, such that when folded at the orbital period the transits are aligned in the resulting lightcurve. The multi-planet transit model was then refit out to the deTTVed lightcurve and used the updated template to determine the final set of TTVs shown by the green points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Uncertainties in the transit times were determined by examining the residuals from the fits to each individual transits and scaling the photometric errors such that reduced χ 2 was equal to one. The diagonal elements of the co-variance matrix were adopted as the uncertainty in the measurement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">TT Measurements by Eric Agol</head><p>The times of transit were fit using a quadratic limb-darkening model in which the duration and impact parameter for each planet were assumed to be fixed, while the times of each transit were allowed to vary. The model was computed simultaneously for the short cadence (when available) and long cadence data (otherwise). A window equal to one transit duration was included before and after every transit. The lightcurve was divided by the model (computed for all planets simultaneously so that overlapping transits were properly accounted for), and then fit with a third-order polynomial for each contiguous data set (without gaps larger than 12 hours). The model parameters were optimized until a best fit was found; a second iteration was carried out after outliers from the first fit were rejected. After finding the best fit, the times of each and every transit were allowed to vary over a grid of values spanning (typically) about 2 hours on either side of the best fit time. The variation in χ 2 with transit time was then fit with a quadratic function to measure the uncertainty in the transit time. If that fit failed, then the transit time error was measured from the width of the χ 2 function for values less than one above the best fit value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">TT Measurements by Donald Short</head><p>In contrast to the Rowe and Agol methods, a purely mathematical technique was used to determine the transit times, under the assertion that the time of a transit event can be estimated without need of a physical model of the event. Under conditions of poor signal-to-noise ratio or undersampling, the constraints imposed by a physical model are extremely valuable. For high signal-to-noise cases, a non-physical model can match, or even excel a physical model under certain conditions. The limitations in a physical model, such as imperfect limb darkening parameterization or assumed zero eccentricity, have no consequence in a non-physical model.</p><p>Since no assumptions about sphericity, obliquity, gravity darkening, strict keplerian motion, etc., were made, the method is insensitive to errors in these physical parameters or effects.</p><p>Both LC and SC data were used in computing the planetary transit time estimates, provided the pipeline data quality flag had the nominal value of zero. The TTs were estimated by an iterative method starting with the SC data. Using an estimate of the transit duration and estimates of the transit times based on the linear ephemeris from <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lissauer et al. (2011a)</ref>, each transit was locally detrended. Detrending employed a low-order polynomial centered on the transit and extending symmetrically either 0.3, 0.6, or 0.83 days beyond the ends of the transit; the length and polynomial order that provided the best fit to these out-of-transit data was selected. During this process, each transit was checked for missing data and overlapping transits from other planets that could compromise the determination of that TT. Transits that had such problems were eliminated from further consideration. After detrending, the transits were shifted in time so that the center of each transit was at time zero. All of the transits were then combined ("stacked" or "folded" on top of each other). A piecewise cubic Hermite spline (PCHS) was then least-squares fit to the combined-transit lightcurve, giving a transit template. The transit template was generated by the data themselves; no physical constraints on its shape were imposed. As such, it should be an excellent match to the observed transits. From this template, a refined transit width was estimated -33 -and used to revise the detrending of each transit. The template was then correlated with each individual transit, yielding improved TTs. Any outliers with respect to the template were flagged and eliminated from further template building, but no rejections were made when estimating the individual TTs. The detrended transits were shifted (folded) on the revised TTs, combined, and a new PCHS template generated. Again, the individual transits were then detrended, now using both the revised duration and revised transit times. The detrended transits were correlated with the revised template, yielding a refined set of TTs. Three iterations of this process were carried out.</p><p>The uncertainty in each TT was estimated from the shifts in time needed to degrade the χ 2 fit of the template to the transit by one.</p><p>For transits with LC data only, the SC PCHS template was convolved to 30 minutes, yielding the LC template. The LC template was then correlated with each transit, providing a correction to the times from the initial linear ephemeris. The revised TTs were used to improve the detrending window, but the template was not updated-it was held fixed at the shape derived from the SC template. This process iteratively produced measurements of the TTs, uncertainties, and model fits for each transit. Finally, those TTs that had large timing error estimates (&gt;40 minutes) were eliminated from the final list of TTs.</p><p>The process above was repeated independently for each planet, noting that overlapping transits from different planets were discarded. In general, the TTs computed by this method agree quite well with the physical methods; however, the error estimates are notably larger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Appendix B: Details of Dynamical Models</head><p>Here we present the results of our dynamical models in detail. We carried out three classes of fit using each set of TTs. In the "all-circular" class, all planets were assumed to travel on circular orbits at epoch. In the "all-eccentric" class, all planets were allowed to have eccentric orbits at -34 -epoch. We found that the quality of these fits was not sensitive to the mass or eccentricity of planet Kepler-11 g as long as these were not too large, so we performed "g-fixed" fits wherein the eccentricity of planet g is set to zero at epoch and its mass set to 25.3 × 10 −6 M ⋆ (which equals 8 M ⊕ for an assumed stellar mass of 0.95 M ⊕ , as estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> compares the quality of fit between using various data sets and assumptions. Note that comparisons of the numerical values between the quality of fits using different data sets are not meaningful because of the differing prescriptions employed to compute the uncertainties of individual TTs, but comparison between the reduced χ 2 for the all-circular, all-eccentric, and g-fixed results using a given set of TTs shows that eccentricities are detected for the five inner planets but not for planet g. As the quality of the all-circular fits are distinctly inferior to those that allow at least the five inner planets to travel on eccentric orbits, we do not consider the all-circular fits further.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref>, the g-fixed fits, which are presented in <ref type="table">Tables 6, 7</ref> and 8, are of slightly better quality (in a χ 2 /d.o.f. sense) than are the corresponding all-eccentric fits.

They derived an effective temperature, T eff = 5680 ±100 K, surface gravity, log g = 4.3 ±0.2 (cgs), metallicity, [Fe/H] = 0.0 ± 0.1 dex, and projected stellar equatorial rotation v sin i = 0.4 ± 0.5 km s −1 .

We adopt a detection threshold that is approximately a 3σ detection of the secondary star. We find no stellar companion to Kepler-11 within 0.4 ′′ of the primary star, corresponding to half of the slit-width (0.87 ′′ ) of the Keck-HIRES spectrometer. The detection threshold for any companion star depends on the RV separation between the primary star and the putative secondary star. For all RV separations greater than 20 km s −1 , we would detect (at 3σ) any companions that are 2% as bright (in the optical) as the primary star. For RV separations of 10 km s −1 , the detection threshold rises to 3% as bright as the primary star, and for RV separations smaller than 10 km s −1 , the detection threshold rises rapidly to unity for FGK stars, but remains at 3% for M dwarfs due to their very different spectra. The poor detectability of FGK-type companion stars having little Doppler offset is caused by overlap of the absorption lines. Speckle images for Kepler-11 show no nearby star. Neighbors located in an annulus from 0.05 to 0.7 ′′ from Kepler-11 would have been detected if their brightness were within 3 magnitudes in either V or I band, and those between 0.7 and 1.9 ′′ distant would have been seen down to a magnitude difference of 4 in either band.</figDesc></figure>

(2011a), and the newly-estimated masses of Kepler-11 b and c are within 2σ of their values; the various fits presented by Migaszewski et al. (2012) are of comparable accuracy. The major differences from the results presented by Lissauer et al. (2011a) are that the planetary radii are ∼ 10% smaller than previously estimated, and planets Kepler-11 b and especially c are less massive than estimates computed with Q1-Q6 data, resulting in the nominal masses monotonically</figDesc></figure>

Planets are color-coded by the incident bolometric flux that they receive. Kepler planets are shown by circles, filled for Kepler-11, open for others, with numbers and letters indicating each planet. Other known exoplanets in this mass and radius range are shown by open squares; in order of increasing radius, these are CoRoT-7 b, 55 Cancre e, GJ 1214 b and GJ 3470 b. Solar System planets Venus and Uranus are shown by black letters. The solid black curve is for an Earth-like composition with 2/3 rock and 1/3 iron by mass. All other curves use thermal evolution calculations (Lopez et al. 2012), assuming a volatile envelope atop a core of rock and iron with composition the same as that of the bulk Earth. The dashed blue curve is for 50% water by mass, and the solid blue curve is for a pure H 2 O planet. The dotted orange curves are for H/He envelopes at 8 Gyr; each one is tailored to match a Kepler-11 planet and is computed at the appropriate flux for that planet.</figDesc></figure>

The quoted uncertainties include the measured uncertainties on each planet's mass, radius, incident flux, and age as well as theoretical uncertainties on the albedo and the iron fraction of the rocky/iron core (Marcus et al. 2010). Despite the small mass fractions in light gases, the presence of these H/He envelopes is key to the observed radii. One way to emphasize this fact is to compare each planet's radius to the radius of its rocky core, as determined by our thermal evolution models for planets lacking H 2 O. For every Kepler-11 planet whose mass has been measured except for b, approximately half of the observed radius is due to its H/He envelope. The cores make up 46%, 54%, 40%, and 48% of the total radii of planets Kepler-11 c, d, e, &amp; f, respectively, and thus only 6 -16% of the volume. Moreover, even for Kepler-11 b, the rocky core only makes up 66% of the total radius, corresponding to 29% of this planet's volume. In addition, we have included a updated version of the mass loss threshold diagram presented in Lopez et al. (2012). Figure 10 plots incident flux against the product of planet mass times planet density. Diagonal lines (i.e., lines with slope = 1) in this space correspond to constant mass loss timescales for a specified mean molecular weight of escaping gas, making this diagram useful for understanding how the population of highly-irradiated planets has been sculpted by photoevaporation (Lecavelier des Etangs 2007). Here we have color-coded planets by the fraction of their mass in the H/He envelope, assuming an Earth-like core. Four known exoplanets are dense enough to be composed of bare rock (this list includes Kepler-20 b, whose large error ellipse in the mass-radius plane is mostly outside of the rocky composition zone); these planets are shown as rust colored. The key feature of Figure 10 is that there is a critical mass loss timescale above which there are no planets with significant H/He envelopes. The dashed black line shows the critical mass loss timescale found by Lopez et al. (2012). The existence of such a mass loss threshold is a robust predication of planet evolution models that include photoevaporation -28 - (Owen &amp; Jackson 2012; Lopez et al. 2012). The three planets that lie above this threshold in the upper right are Kepler-10 b (Batalha et al. 2011), CoRoT-7 b (Léger et al. 2009; Queloz et al. 2009; Hatzes et al. 2011), and 55 Cancri e (Winn et al. 2011; Demory et al. 2011), none of which are expected to have H/He envelopes. With the newly-estimated masses, Kepler-11 b and c are clearly highly vulnerable to photoevaporation; in fact they both lie on the critical mass loss timescale identified by Lopez et al. (2012). On the other hand, planets Kepler-11 d and e have predicted mass loss rates a factor of a few below this threshold. However, this does not mean that these planets have not experienced significant mass loss. Using the original discovery masses, Lopez et al. (2012) showed that planets Kepler-11 d and e could have lost at least half of their initial H/He envelopes. Moreover, the assumption of a single critical mass loss timescale is only a rough approximation. The efficiency of photoevaporative mass loss changes as a function of irradiation and stellar age (Owen &amp; Jackson 2012). In particular, more irradiated planets like Kepler-11 b and c lose more energy to radiation and recombination-driven cooling, resulting in lower mass loss efficiencies and thus a higher threshold in Figure 10 (Murray-Clay et al. 2009</figDesc></figure>
