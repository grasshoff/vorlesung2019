			<abstract>
				<p>Most directly imaged giant exoplanets are fainter than brown dwarfs with similar spectra. To explain their relative underluminosity unusually cloudy atmospheres have been proposed. However, with multiple parameters varying between any two objects, it remained difficult to observationally test this idea. We present a new method, sensitive time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared spectroscopy, to study two rotating L/T transition brown dwarfs (2M2139 and SIMP0136). The observations provide spatially and spectrally resolved mapping of the cloud decks of the brown dwarfs. The data allow the study of cloud structure variations while other parameters are unchanged. We find that both brown dwarfs display variations of identical nature: J-and H-band brightness variations with minimal color and spectral changes. Our light curve models show that even the simplest surface brightness distributions require at least three elliptical spots. We show that for each source the spectral changes can be reproduced with a linear combination of only two different spectra, i.e. the entire surface is covered by two distinct types of regions. Modeling the color changes and spectral variations together reveal patchy cloud covers consisting of a spatially heteroge-nous mix of low-brightness, low-temperature thick clouds and brighter, thin and warm clouds. We show that the same thick cloud patches seen in our varying brown dwarf targets, if extended to the entire photosphere, predict near-infrared colors/magnitudes matching the range occupied by the directly imaged exoplan-ets that are cooler and less luminous than brown dwarfs with similar spectral types. This supports the models in which thick clouds are responsible for the near infrared properties of these &quot;underluminous&quot; exoplanets.</p>

The different models proposed to explain the lower near-infrared luminosity of exoplanets and brown dwarfs invoke differences in elemental abundances, surface gravity differences, evolutionary state, chemical equilibrium/non-equilibrium, or cloud structure, or some combination of these. -6 -However, because several of these parameters may change between any two brown dwarfs or exoplanets it remained difficult to isolate the effect of these variables. Possible differences in the structure of condensate clouds have, in particular, received much attention in models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burgasser et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skemer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Barman et al. 2011a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Burrows et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Madhusudhan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marley et al. 2010</ref> and progress has been made in spectroscopic modeling to separate or constrain the impact of cloud structure from other parameters (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cruz et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Folkes et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Looper et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burgasser et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Radigan et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cushing et al. 2010</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Observations and Targets</head><p>We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain near-infrared grism spectroscopy of two L/T transition brown dwarfs as part of a larger campaign ( <ref type="bibr">Programs 12314, 12551</ref> PI: Apai). The data were acquired with the sensitive Wide Field Camera 3 instrument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">MacKenty et al. 2010</ref>) by obtaining 256×256 pixel images of the targets' spectra dispersed by the G141 grism in six consecutive HST orbits. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> provides a log of the observations. In short, we obtained 660 spectra for 2M2139, each with 22.34s integration time; and 495 spectra for SIMP0136, each with 22.34s integration time. In the analysis that follows we averaged sets of 10 spectra for 2M2139 and sets of 5 spectra for SIMP0136, giving us an effective temporal resolution of 223s for 2M2139 and 112s for SIMP0136. Our targets are relatively bright (J=13.5 mag for SIMP0136 and J=15.3 mag for 2M2139), resulting in very high signal-to-noise spectra (see Sect. 2.3 for a detailed assessment).</p><p>At the beginning of each orbit a direct image was obtained to accurately determine the position of the source on the detector, required for precise wavelength calibration.</p><p>Cross-correlation of the images and centroid positions on-source revealed positional differences less than 0.1 pixel (0.01") between images taken at different orbits. No dithering was applied to stabilize source positions, and improve the accuracy of relative measurements. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data Reduction</head><p>Our reduction pipeline combined the standard aXe pipeline with a custom-made IDL script, which included corrections for different low-level detector systematics, critical for highly precise relative spectroscopy. We used two-dimensional spectral images from the standard WFC3 pipeline, which were bias and dark current-subtracted, and corrected for non-linearity and gain. Bad pixels were marked by a corresponding flag in the data quality plane. In order to correct for detector systematics we started with the .ima files, which -9 -contain all non-destructive sub-reads of each exposure, rather than the combined .flt images. Because our observations were not taken with a dithering pattern, we did not use the standard pipeline's MultiDrizzle routine.</p><p>We first extracted all sub-reads, discarded the first two zero-reads (0 s and 0.27 s),</p><p>and compared the count rates of the individual pixels over the sub-reads of an exposure to identify and remove outliers by replacing them with the median value. We also corrected flagged bad pixels by interpolating over adjacent good pixels in the same row.</p><p>We identified a systematic nearly linear flux loss from the first to last subread of an exposure, with a steeper slope for the brighter pixels of a spectrum. We empirically determined a slope of −0.2% per 22.34 s (one subread) for pixels of brightness &gt;60% of the maximum in the spectrum, and only −0.001% for pixels below that level <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>The uncertainties of the slopes are negligible, but a significant 'zig-zag' pattern is present with a scatter of ∼ 0.1%. The standard deviation of the normalized fluxes measured at the same exposure but in different orbits is ≤0.2%. This relation held for all of our objects, regardless of the absolute brightness of the spectra. Only the first subread had systematically higher flux than expected from the linear relation and had to be corrected individually for each source.</p><p>The spectral extraction was executed with aXe (Space Telescope-European</p><p>Coordinating Facility, ESA 2011). First, the sub-array images were embedded in larger, full frame-sized images to allow aXe to use standard instrument calibration frames, which are full-frame sized. The data quality flag was used to exclude the extra surrounding pixels of the extended frame from the actual data analysis. As a first step, the aXe pipeline subtracted a scaled master sky frame, with the scale factor determined individually for each images background level (i.e. excluding the observed spectra). Then, the location of the target spectrum and the wavelength calibration were determined from the direct (non-grism) -10 -images. For the source 2M2139, only one direct image was obtained at the beginning of the first orbit and this image was used for each subsequent spectra. For SIMP0136, a separate direct image was taken at the beginning of each orbit and used for all spectra in the given orbit. We fixed the spectral extraction width within each orbit, but allowed it to vary between subsequent orbits. The extraction width was determined by summing up all spectra in a single orbit and then collapsing the sum into a one-dimensional vertical profile. The extraction width was then chosen as three times the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of a gaussian fit to that profile. This resulted in an extraction width with mean and standard deviation for the six orbits of 6.50±0.02 for SIMP0136 and 6.56±0.01 px for 2M2139, respectively.</p><p>In the final step the spectra from each image were flat fielded, extracted, and collapsed using the standard pixel extraction tables of aXe and flux-calibrated with the latest instrument sensitivity curves. This led to one-dimensional spectra with a spectral resolution of R=λ/∆λ 130 and highly reliable data over the wavelength range from 1.1 to 1.7 µm.</p><p>We calculated the uncertainties as composed of photon shot noise, read-noise, and sky noise. A second systematic detector effect became evident at this point. During each orbit, there was a small increase in flux in the form of an exponential ramp <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Because the intrinsic variability of the sources prevented a direct quantification of this effect, we used the partial spectrum of a bright star visible in one of our target fields. The ramp was found to be independent of object brightness. We integrated the stellar spectrum over the full wavelength range and removed exposures where saturation had occurred.</p><p>We fitted the exponential ramp C × (1 − Ae −t/T ) to the light curve, where t is the time since the beginning of an orbit. The ramp was very similar for all the orbits between the second and sixth, which we therefore averaged before fitting, but it was a different, stronger effect in the first orbit of a visit, which was fitted and corrected individually. In the final step we corrected the spectra of all our objects by dividing the time-dependent -11 -data by the value of the analytical ramp function sampled at the times of the sub-reads. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the ramp and its best-fit parameters. The latter are the following: For Orbit 1 A = 0.0185 ± 0.0013, T = 5.95 ± 0.88, and C = 1.0005 ± 0.0005, while for orbits 2-6 : A = 0.0077 ± 0.0009, T = 16.65 ± 6.02, C = 1.0025 ± 0.0009. Note, that these uncertainties include the propagated uncertainties from the slope correction described above. The combined uncertainties for the ramp correction lead to a 1σ uncertainty of 0.15%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Uncertainties</head><p>In the following we briefly discuss the uncertainties of our measurements. We distinguish three different uncertainties that affect our data: random (white) noise emerging from photon noise and readout noise, systematic wavelength-dependent trends, and systematic time-dependent trends. As explained below, due the fact that our targets are very bright by HST's standards the photon noise is very small (typically well below 0.1%) and the systematic wavelength-dependent trends are negligible, the residual time-dependent trends dominate the noise in our data. We characterize the amplitude of each of these three components based on our data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">White noise</head><p>Random (white) noise is present in our data due to the combination of photon noise, residual dark noise, and read-out noise. While all three components are present at very low levels, often negligible for practical purposes, we use our data to measure their combined amplitude. To do this we extract pixel-to-pixel variations helped by the fact that our temporal resolution (&lt;1 minute) significantly exceeds the timescale on which the astrophysical changes occur. We started from the binned spectral cubes containing 66 To measure the white noise amplitude we calculated the standard deviation of the data in each spectrum and their median. We find that for 2M2139 the 1σ noise per resolution element is 0.27%, while for the brighter SIMP0136 the 1σ noise per resolution elements is 0.11%.</p><p>We point out that most of the conclusions in this paper are drawn from brightness variations measured in broad photometric bands, further decreasing the importance of white noise. For example, the J-band light curves in our spectra typically contain 55 data points, leading to a white noise contribution of less than 0.04%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Time-dependent trends</head><p>Because we study temporal changes in our targets it is important to assess the level of time-dependent trends (red noise) in our data. Any red noise present in the data would come for a time-dependent sensitivity variations, potentially introduced either by drifts in the positions of the sources or by sensitivity changes in the instrument. Our measurements of the positions of the sources show that the targets have remained in precisely the same positions, thus contribution from the former noise factor can not be significant. The second noise source, changes in the instrumental sensitivity, however, must be characterized -13 -through our data. Due to observing efficiency considerations our observations were taken in a subarray mode, which has a relatively small field of view and thus and do not contain any other sources of comparable brightness to the targets. Therefore, we do not have other non-varying sources in the same datasets that could be used to measure time-dependent trends in our data. Instead, we use a third brown dwarf target observed identically to our targets to assess time-dependent trends. This third target, 2MASSJ09153413+0422045 (in the following 2M0915), did not show variability above the 0.6% level and thus provides us with a good reference for measuring the temporal stability of the observations. 2M0915</p><p>is a resolved binary brown dwarf (L7+L7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Reid et al. 2006</ref>), allowing us to measure flux levels for the two sources simultaneously. We point out that although the wings of the two spectra show some overlap, this overlap should not affect the photometric stability of the measurements and the following assessment of the systematic uncertainties.</p><p>We reduced the 2M0915 data set in the same way as data from the other two sources, with the exception that a larger aperture was adopted to include both of the slightly overlapping sources. The data reduction was repeated two times, with the aperture once centered on component A and once centered on component B.</p><p>For the two components we measured a mean standard deviation of points within the same orbit of 0.16% and 0.13%, fully consistent with the combined uncertainties of the correction of the systematic effects and the white noise components. The fact that this standard deviation is not larger demonstrates that there is no measurable systematic trend left uncorrected on timescales of an orbit or less.</p><p>To assess the photometric stability of HST over timescales of multiple orbits we determined the scatter of the mean values in each orbit. Thus, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean values of the fluxes measured in each of the six orbits. We found that these values were 0.25% and 0.13% for the two components; these values are our estimates -14 -for the uncertainties of the photometric stability of HST over six orbits.</p><p>Thus, based on the measurements of the noise properties we conclude the following:</p><p>1) the random (white) noise level is 0.3% per resolution element and integration; 2) the random noise of band-integrated light curves is less than 0.04% (practically negligible);</p><p>3) the photometric stability between orbits is about 0.25% or less; 4) photometric trends within an orbit (&lt;50 minutes) amount to 0.16% or less. Therefore, although the differences discussed in our paper are small (typically few percent levels) they are all high significance level detections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>Our observations provided a series of very high signal-to-noise (SNR&gt;300) spectra (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) of the targets covering the 1.1 to 1.7 µm wavelength range. These spectra probe the J and H broad-band photometric bands, prominent molecular absorption bands (water, methane), as well as atomic resonance lines (K I, Na I).</p><p>The spectra of both targets are dominated by deep and broad water vapor absorption at 1.1 µm, 1.4 µm, and 1.7 µm. Characteristic of L/T transition dwarfs, they both display narrower neutral atomic lines and weaker CH 4 absorption. Both sources showed dramatic brightness changes during the observations. Synthetic photometry derived in the core of the standard J-and H-bands (centered at 1.2 and 1.6 µm) display variations with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 27% (2M2139) and 4.5% (SIMP0136). The variations are periodic and we estimate the periods to be 7.83±0.1 hr and 2.39 ±0.05 hr for 2M2139 and SIMP0136, respectively. The period for 2M2139 was derived by least square minimization of the light curve segments overlapping in phase (see inset in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) and leads to a 0.35% standard deviation in the overlapping region, but a slightly imperfect match in light curve shape.</p><p>-15 -In contrast, a somewhat shorter period (7.76 h) provides a near-perfect match for the light curve shape, but leads to a slightly higher standard deviation (0.55%). Given the information at hand we conservatively assume that the period is 7.83±0.1 h. Determining the period for SIMP0136 poses a different challenge: Although the overlap in phase is much larger than it is for 2M2139, the light curve shows a clear evolution during the extent of our observations. We find that assuming a period of 2.39 h aligns the troughs in the light curve, but leads to a shift between consecutive peaks; in turn, a period of 2.42 h aligns the peaks well but leads to a mismatch in the troughs. This behavior is fully consistent with the light curve evolution observed in this source; in the following we conservatively assume that the period of SIMP 0136 is 2.39 ±0.07h.</p><p>These rotational periods were determined by minimizing the differences in phase-folded For the precise shape of the variations we refer the reader to the Ratio panels in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> and here only highlight the peak of the ratios in the J and H bands. For 2M2139 the flux density change ∆F in the observed spectra peaks in the J-band at 33% at 1.20 µm and in the H-band at a level of 28% at 1.58 µm. For SIMP0136 ∆F peaks in the J-band at 1.15µm</p><p>at 5.9% and ∆F 1.56µm at a level of 5.8%. While the changes in the J and H bands are smooth and similar, in both sources the water absorption bands between ∼ 1.32 − 1.50 µm vary at much lower levels: for example ∆F 1.4µm = 14% for 2M2139 and ∆F 1.4µm = 3.2% for SIMP0136. Note, that given our uncertainties of 0.25% for multi-orbit photometric stability (see Sect. 2.3) these differences are all highly significant. Surprisingly, with the exception of the water all other gas-phase absorption bands (CH 4 , Na I, K I) change together with the continuum. The light curve of 2M2139 shows nearly sinusoidal variations, but SIMP0136 displays sharper, more structured variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Spectral Variations and PCA Analysis</head><p>Both light curves contain distinct and prominent higher-frequency components.

In <ref type="figure">Figure Fig. 3</ref> the mean spectrum and first two principal components (S,E 0 , and E 1 ), as well as the time-variability of the principal components (c i (t)) are shown for both targets. In both cases, variations are given by S(t) ≈ ≈S + c 0 (t)E 0 , where only a single principal component is required to account for most of the observed variability. This implies that only two dominant spectra contribute to the observed variations (e.g., take E 0 to represent the difference between two types of time-independent spectra S 2 − S 1 ), with the appearance of one "surface type" completely correlated with disappearance of the other.</p><p>Thus, our major conclusion is that only two types of "surface" patches (e.g. cloudy and clear, or thick and thin clouds) are required to explain the observations in both of these sources. This finding validates a simple light curve model, applied below, in which the photosphere is describe by a linear combination of two 1D model atmospheres differing in cloud thickness and/or temperature. Interestingly, for both 2M2139 and SIMP0136 we find that models with at least three spots are required to explain the structured light curves: Models with only one or two elliptical spots failed to reproduce the observed light curves. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">Fig. 8</ref> we show the best-fit model, a non-unique, but representative solution for 2M2139. Additional models with somewhat different surface distributions are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Although the solutions are somewhat degenerate (as discussed in Section A) the best solutions for 2M2139 all agree in the following: 1) the overall longitudinal spot covering fraction distribution is similar (between 20% and 30%); 2) at least three spots are required; 3) the surface brightness of the spots typically differ by a factor of two to three (either brighter or fainter) from the -19 -surface, corresponding to approximately 300 K difference in brightness temperature; 4) the size of the largest spot extends about 60 • in diameter. We note that more complex solutions with a higher number of spots are also possible, but these replace the larger spots with groups of smaller spots, without changing the general properties identified above.</p><p>An important property of all solutions is the presence of very extended spots or spot groups in the photosphere, which raises the question whether such large structures can exist in the fast-rotating, warm brown dwarfs. As for Jupiter the gradient of the Coriolis force on our rotating targets is expected to break the atmospheric circulation into parallel jet systems (belts), which will limit the maximum size of continuous atmospheric structures.</p><p>Here, we use the Rhines scale (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Showman et al. 2010</ref>) to estimate the relative number of jet systems between our fast-rotating and slowly rotating sources:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">N jet 2Ω×a U 1/2 , where</formula><p>Ω is the angular velocity, a is the brown dwarf radius, and U is the wind speed. If the maximum size of a feature (s i ) is limited by the jet width, the relative maximum spot sizes for two sources will be given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s 1 s 2 = π/N jet,1 π/N jet,2 = Ω 1 a 1 U 2 Ω 2 a 2 U 1 1/2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Further, for both sources a 1 and a 2 should closely approach 1 R Jup . If we assume that the wind speeds (U 1 and U 2 ) are similar in these two T2 dwarfs, the relative spot sizes in Eq 2 will be simply approximated by s 1 /s 2 = (P 2 /P 1 ) 2 , arguing for ∼3.2× larger maximum spot surfaces on 2M2139 than on SIMP0136, in line with the larger amplitudes observed.</p><p>Based on the above considerations we can also estimate the physical spot sizes.</p><p>Although wind speeds are not known for brown dwarfs, in the following we explore the not accurately determine the wind speeds in our targets, the fact that these sources show large-amplitude variations emerging from large regions across their photospheres argues for wind speeds that are higher than those typical to Jupiter.</p><p>The simple predictions described above are consistent with the much larger variation seen in the slowly rotating 2M2139 than in its faster-rotating sibling and the predicted maximum spot sizes are similar to the size of the largest spots predicted by the best-fit light curve models of 2M2139 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. With more data on varying brown dwarfs a realistic treatment of the atmospheric circulation will be possible, replacing the simple argument introduced above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Atmospheric Model Comparisons</head><p>Even the most capable state-of-the-art ultracool model atmospheres provide only imperfect fits to the fine structure of brown dwarf spectra; therefore, the full interpretation of our very high signal-to-noise spectral series is constrained by the fact that no existing model can accurately describe atmospheres at sub-percent accuracy. Nevertheless, the  . We find that for 2M2139 the best matching spectral template is a T2 type template, while for SIMP0136 a T2.5 provides a good match.</p><p>Both sources can be fit well with a BT-SETTL model in local thermodynamical equilibrium and an effective temperature of 1,200 K, but fitting the spectrum of 2M2139 requires a lower surface gravity (log g=4.5) than SIMP0136, which is better matched by a higher surface gravity model (log g=5.0). Fits with the Burrows models suggest slightly lower temperatures. Given the coarser spacing of the surface gravity grid of the Burrows models we used log g=4.0 for 2M2139 and log g=5.0 for SIMP0136. Although the lower surface gravity fits better our spectra, due to its limited wavelength coverage we take these log g values as comparative but do not argue that they represent accurate characterization of the surface gravity (see also Cushing et al. e.g. 2008 for the difficulty of determining precise atmospheric parameters from single-band spectroscopy). The modal grain sizes are an adjustable parameter in the Burrows models and models with large grains provided the best match for 2M2139. We note that this model comparison is based on peak-to-valley normalized spectra, i.e. focuses on the spectral shape rather than the absolute J, H brightnesses -we do so because our sources show strong J, H-band variations and only weak variations in the spectral shape.</p><p>After establishing the best-fit starting model for the two sources, we explore what secondary surface type is required to explain the observed color-magnitude variations. Our tool for this step is the near-infrared color-magnitude diagram shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4</ref>. Here we plotted a full sequence of L/T dwarfs using the parallax and near-infrared photometric database by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">A Single Spot Type</head><p>Because of the richness of possible condensates in brown dwarf atmospheres one may expect a complex mix of cloud properties, composition, and cloud scale height to be represented even within a single brown dwarf atmosphere. The observational fingerprint of such surface complexity in a rotating brown dwarf would be multi-component, complex changes in the spectra, brightness, and color. In stark contrast, the two sources observed</p><p>show a single distinct type of simple change. This is reflected, for example, in the single-direction track in the color-magnitude diagram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig. 4)</ref>. The PCA analysis (see Section 3.1) reveals that all the observed variance in the two sources can be reproduced with the combination of only two different spectra. This surprising result shows that all major features in the visible photosphere, although distributed across both hemispheres of each target, share the same spectra (i.e. same deviation from the mean spectrum).</p><p>We note that based on spectral fits from composite near-infrared spectra Burgasser et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2010)</ref> has identified 2M2139 as a strong candidate for being an unresolved binary brown dwarf. These authors argue that 2M2139 could be matched better, although imperfectly, by a blend of an L7-L9.5 and a T3.5-T4.0 binary than by any single template brown dwarf. It is tempting to consider the possibility that the fit by two blended spectra in this case is not the sign of an unresolved binary, but instead emerges from the blend of two different surface types on the source (as also proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Khandrika et al. 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Radigan et al. 2012</ref>)-one with a spectrum of an L8.5±0.7 dwarf, the other with -25 -a spectrum of a T3.5±1.0 dwarf. However, this explanation is unlikely to be correct. A composite spectrum of two such dwarfs with time-varying weights due to the rotation would introduce J vs. J-H color variations in the direction of the L-T transition, very different to what we observed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4</ref>).</p><p>The fact that flux density in the observed molecular bands -with the exception of the less-changing water band -varies together and at the same rate as the continuum shows that the opacity variations in the targets cannot originate from changes in the abundances of the common gas-phase absorbers, such as methane. Based on comparison to atmosphere models we argue that these spots are patches of very thick clouds. The fact that any two such cloud patch would share the same spectra, different from the dominant spectrum of the sources, argues for the presence of a single mechanism to form these thick cloud patches.</p><p>Possibilities, as explored below, include circulation and large-scale vertical mixing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Complex Surfaces</head><p>With our surface mapping tools (see Section 3.2) we find that both sources have relatively complex surface brightness distributions: assuming elliptical spots, no one-or two-spot model can reproduce the structure of the light curves. While our model is not able to deduce the precise appearance of the photosphere, it provides useful insights into the complexity and overall distribution of the thick cloud patches observed. Specifically, the lightcurve and our models reveal that a large fraction of the surface of both targets is covered by the cloud patches. These patches may be very large single structures (corresponding to our simplest model) or they may be super-structures, consisting of dozens or even hundreds of smaller cloud patches with the same surface covering fractions.</p><p>Whether single or complex structures, however, any mechanism that explains the spectral appearance and high cloud scale height, needs to account for the concentration of these atmosphere combination the fraction of surface covered by thick clouds varies from about 50% to 63% on the visible 2M2139, while it occupies only 25% to 29% of the surface of SIMP0136 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4</ref>). Thus, the modeling suggests that most of 2M2139's surface is covered by thick clouds with large thin patches (that are brighter and contribute most of the observed emission), while SIMP0136 has an overall thin cloud layer with large patches of thick clouds. Although the covering fractions are different, based on the overall similarity of the spectra and the spectral variations these two sources have very similar thin and thick cloud layers.</p><p>The complex distribution of otherwise similar or identical thick cloud patches also offers opportunity for further exploration of the dynamics of brown dwarf atmospheres.</p><p>Cloud structures are subject to multiple dynamical processes and are likely to evolve on a broad range of timescales. For example, the structure of the light curves may evolve due to differential rotation, an effect that should be observable with high-precision dataset covering sufficient baselines. Other processes, such as thick cloud formation (i.e. rapid increase of the cloud scale height) or the reverse of this process, rain-out of the condensate grains, may also result in changes over relatively short timescales.</p><p>-27 -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Thin and Thick Clouds, but No Deep Holes</head><p>A leading hypothesis to explain the dramatic spectral changes observed to occur at the L/T transition invokes a breaking apart of the cloud cover (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burgasser et al. 2002)</ref> This idea provided motivation for our initial observations, and predicts surfaces consisting of clouds and holes that act as windows into the deeper photosphere. The most simple picture, and the one that has been explored by models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burgasser et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marley et al. 2010</ref>) is one where holes in the cloud layer represent pure clearings, 100% free of condensate opacity. In contrast to this assumption, our observations of two of the most variable brown dwarfs suggest that dark and bright regions of the photosphere represent thick and thin cloud regions rather than cloudy and cloud-free regions (Section 3.3). This may reflect holes in a thick cloud layer that look down into a thinner cloud layer. More generally, our observations argue for a more complex picture of cloud heterogeneities than envisioned with simple cloudy and cloud-free models. A similar conclusion was arrived at by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Radigan et al. (2012)</ref>, who found that JHK photometric monitoring of 2M2139 was inconsistent with the presence of cloud-free regions, based on models of . Thus both photometric observations out to the K band and spectroscopic observations from 1-1.7 microns argue against the existence of cloud-free regions.</p><p>We also found that the cloud thickness variations are correlated with changes in the effective temperature of the secondary model. This correlation is not surprising: the higher the dust scale height, the shallower pressures and the lower temperatures are visible to the external observer (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). This correlation, thus, argues for patches of thick clouds towering over the otherwise thinner cloud layer covering most of the hemispheres of the targets.</p><p>The vertical structure and composition of these thick clouds is an exciting question, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Apparent Underluminosity due to Thick Clouds</head><p>The remarkable cloud scale height variations in our targets demonstrate how this parameter affects the brightness of ultracool atmospheres. Thick clouds persisting at temperatures lower than typical for brown dwarfs have been proposed as one of the processes that may explain the apparent underluminosity of directly imaged giant exoplanets compared to brown dwarfs with similar spectral morphology (magenta crosses in would be present in directly imaged exoplanets due to the low surface gravities of these sources, which provides an attractive and self-consistent explanation for the appearance -29 -and low occurrence rate of these sources. However, the effects of thick clouds remained difficult to verify, as multiple parameters (metallicity, surface gravity, age, mass, chemistry, cloud structure) vary simultaneously between any two ultracool atmosphere. The novelty of our observations is that they are comparing different cloud structures within the same atmospheres, i.e. keeping metallicity, surface gravity, age, mass, and bulk composition constant. This allows isolating the effects of cloud structure. We note that a minor caveat here is that the pressure-temperature profile of atmospheres with large spots may differ from those with only thick or thin clouds; thus, the thick clouds' impact must be evaluated keeping this possible difference in mind.</p><p>We can explore the effect the thick clouds would have by extending their surface covering fraction in our model beyond that observed in our targets, i.e. by increasing the surface covering fractions of the thick cloud patches to values approaching 100%. The resulting green dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4</ref> shows that increasing thick cloud coverage will produce color-magnitude tracks crossing the positions of the directly imaged planets (magenta crosses). Thus, if the thick cloud patches we observed in the atmospheres of our T2 targets would cover their complete or near-complete atmospheres, their near-infrared brightness and colors would provide a good match to the directly imaged exoplanets. These results lend support to the models in which the peculiar color and brightness of exoplanets is introduced by thick clouds, but we note that in this work no attempt was made to match the spectra predicted by our simple models to those observed by exoplanets. While our observations cannot identify the cause for the thick clouds in exoplanets, we expect that any successful model for the thick clouds in faint and red exoplanet atmospheres will also provide an explanation for the coexistence of thin and thick clouds in L/T transition brown dwarfs.</p><p>-30 -</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">The Path to Next Generation Atmosphere Models</head><p>Our observations provide exceptionally high signal-to-noise spectra that probe spectral variations within the photospheres of brown dwarfs. The accuracy of this dataset is high enough that finding a perfect match (&lt; 1%) with existing atmosphere models was not possible, demonstrating the limitations of the existing models. Although the best fit spectra match the mean spectrum to typically within 5-10% in the spectral range studied, which are typically considered to be good fits for brown dwarf atmospheres, these differences are comparable to or larger than the amplitude of changes we observe in our spectral series.</p><p>Therefore, the accuracy of the existing models used in this paper did not allow meaningful modeling of the entire spectral series yet. Instead, in our modeling procedure we started from atmosphere models that provided best fits to the mean spectra of the targets and then explored their color variations. Our approach to model a patchy cloud cover with a linear combination of independent 1D models is imperfect and it is likely not physically self-consistent due to the somewhat different pressure-temperature profiles of these models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marley et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marley et al. , 2012</ref>.</p><p>It is worthwhile to briefly explore the limitations of current models and potential pathways to improve them. Arguably, the key limitations are the incomplete molecular opacity databases and the fundamentally one-dimensional nature of most atmosphere models. Expanding and refining the opacity databases relies on the continuation of ongoing laboratory and theoretical efforts and not limited by the observations of ultracool atmospheres. In contrast, constraining and further developing two-or three-dimensional models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Freytag et al. 2010</ref>) will require more accurate datasets and, in particular, datasets that provide spectrally and spatially resolved information.

Surface Mapping: The Stratos Package</head><p>Translating a light curve into the surface map of a rotating sphere is an underconstrained deconvolution problem. Although due to the nature of the problem not all information can be retrieved, equipped with a few priors about the physically plausible geometries and a very high signal-to-noise data it is possible to derive meaningful maps with robust characteristics.</p><p>To model our data we developed a new IDL package (Stratos). In the following we briefly describe the principles and organization of this package and then discuss the solutions and degeneracies in the derived parameters. In Stratos we apply an optimized forward-modeling procedure to identify the best-fitting two-dimensional map for each spectral series given a small set of a priori assumptions.</p><p>We start by using principal components analysis to identify i, the number of independent spectral components required to explain at least 96% of the observed spectral variance (see Sect. 3.1 for both of our sources i = 2). This determines the number of the types of surface features we include in our model, including the ambient spectrum. Our actual surface model consists of a sphere with j ellipses in its photosphere. The surface brightness level of each of these ellipses is fixed to one of the i distinct levels. Thus, the basic free parameters of the model are the latitude, longitude, axes ratio, and area of each ellipse, i.e. four parameters per ellipse. The relative brightness of the i different surface types are also free parameters (in our case only a single parameter). In addition to these parameters we add the inclination of the targets spin axis and the limb darkening as free parameters.</p><p>We express limb darkening in the commonly used form as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">I(φ) = I 0 × (1 − c × (1 − cos(φ)), -35 -</formula><p>where φ is the angle between the line of sight and the observed surface element and c is the limb darkening coefficient fitted. We allowed c to vary between 0 and 0.8, the former representing no limb darkening and latter upper bound corresponding to the strongest limb darkening predicted in near-infrared wavelengths for low-mass stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Claret &amp; Bloemen 2011</ref>).</p><p>We optimize the above model using a genetic algorithm, a commonly applied heuristic optimization algorithm (see Charbonneau e.g. 1995). We define the fitness of each solution by the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and observed spectral variations. Multiple parallel optimization runs were executed on a 12-core Intel Xeon-based Mac Pro; typical runtimes are about two days per target.</p><p>The maps derived with phase mapping and Stratos have three natural limitations.</p><p>First, our data is sensitive to variations in the surface brightness distributions and insensitive to time-invariant features. Second, the observations can only probe the visible fraction of the photosphere: for a rotation axis inclined with respect to the plane of the sky part of the photosphere will not be visible at any rotation phase. Third, a variation in the latitude of any feature only slightly changes the light curve.</p><p>The above limitations lead to solutions that are degenerate in some parameters, while robust in others. In the following we discuss the similarities and degeneracies in the best-fit solutions.</p><p>During a typical fitting procedure Stratos evaluates about 10 5 different solutions. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the light curves for the six best-fit models for 2M2139, the target with the highest signal-to-noise levels. Note, that the light curves predicted by the six models differ the most in the inter-orbit gaps, where HST could not obtain data. These models provide excellent fits and the amplitude of the residuals are less than 0.5% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">(Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>-36 - <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> provides an overview of the six best-fit surface maps. For the first glance these solutions may appear different, but even cursory inspection reveals that all solutions share several key characteristics. First, three spots provide excellent fits to the observations, whereas no one-or two-spot solution was acceptable. Second, the longitudinal distributions of the visible surface area occupied by lighter and darker features are very similar. Third, the projected sizes and relative positions of the two larger spots are also similar when considering the inclination of the model. Clearly, there are also several parameter pairs that are degenerate and not tightly constrained: the inclination and the limb darkening and, to a lesser degree, the spot size and the spot surface brightness.</p><p>Bright spot/dark spot degeneracy: Our surface modeling procedure can model the light curves equally good with large bright spots on darker surface or with large darker spots on a lighter surface. These solutions -when the inclination and the latitudinal integration is considered -appear to be inverse of each other and, ultimately, lead to the same longitudinal one-dimensional surface brightness distribution. At the level of accuracy of our measurements these two families of solutions are degenerate, although they may be distinguishable in the future with more precise datasets and a shape model for the features. In the context of our atmospheric modeling the darker regions can be interpreted as covered by thick clouds, while the brighter regions are covered by thinner clouds with a higher-pressure upper boundary (i.e. warmer). Whether the photosphere should be interpreted as a thin cloud layer with towering thick clouds or a thick cloud layer with depressions or cavities (but not deep holes) depends on the covering fraction of the two surface types. The atmospheric modeling (see Section 3.3 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Fig. 4</ref>) provides guidance on the probable relative covering fractions: the models suggest a thin cloud cover varying between 71% and 75% for SIMP0136 (i.e. dominantly darker spots in a lighter photosphere) and between 37% to 50% thin cloud cover for 2M2139. However, this comparison is imperfect: our lightcurves are sensitive to changes in the surface covering -37 -fractions and insensitive to azimuthally symmetrically distributed photospheric features.</p><p>Such features -bands or evenly distributed small spots -would not influence the light curves (i.e. distribution of the darker/lighter surface features), but would influence the relative photospheric covering fraction of the atmospheric models used. We foresee that our dataset and similar datasets will be modeled in the near future by simultaneously fitting the mean spectra, the spectral changes and the lightcurve shapes in a self-consistent manner, instead of the three-step procedure we followed here.  show that the LC changes are all occurring at the same phase.

This possibility is further supported by the fact that similar underluminosity has also been reported for a handful of field brown dwarfs (e.g. HD 203030B: Metchev &amp; Hillenbrand 2006, HN Peg B: Luhman et al. 2007, 2MASSJ18212815+1414010, 2MASSJ21481628+4003593: Looper et al. 2008) and young</figDesc></figure>

During this overlap the spectra and the flux levels provide very close match in the shape of the light curve. The flux levels differ by only 0.5%, which is twice the 1σ uncertainty we estimated for the photometric stability of our measurements over multi-orbit timescales (see Section 2.3). The fact that the overlapping light curve segments are so similar both in flux and in shape argues against a twice longer period, a possibility ground-based data left open (Radigan et al. 2012). The 2.39 hr and the 7.83 hr rotations are shorter than Jupiter's rotation period (∼9.92h). The left panel of Fig. 2 displays the maximum and minimum spectra observed for both targets as well as their ratio (for clarity we do not plot the entire spectral series). The data are of superb quality (S/N&gt;300) and allow detailed analysis of the changes. Both targets show a strikingly similar pattern: only weakly wavelength-dependent broadband variations. -16 -</figDesc></figure>

We model the surface brightness distributions using the self-developed genetic algorithm-optimized mapping routine Stratos (described in Appendix A in detail). The only assumption of the model is that it describes surface features as elliptical spots with their major axes parallel to the rotational direction, an assumption that is motivated by the common outcome of simulations of hydrodynamical turbulent flows in shallow water approximation (e.g. Cho &amp; Polvani 1996). (We note here that our two targets, just like all Solar System giant planets, will be rotationally dominated with a Rossby number R&lt;&lt; 1, Showman &amp; Kaspi 2012a). The input parameters of the model are the number of spots (i) and the number of different surface types allowed (2 in our case, as given by the PCA); the optimized parameters are the inclination and limb darkening of the BD, the surface brightness of each surface type, as well as five values for each spot (longitude, latitude, aspect ratio, area, and surface type). Possible solutions are ranked and optimized on the basis of their fitness, which we define as the reduced chi square difference between the observed and predicted light curves.</figDesc></figure>

For a discussion on how brown dwarf circulation may fit in this picture we refer the reader to Showman &amp; Kaspi (2012a). We will now assume two bracketing case: U=100 m/s (jupiter-like) and U=1,000 m/s (hot jupiter-like). Our simple approximation with the low and high wind speeds would suggest N jet 17 and N jet 5, respectively, for the slowly-rotating 2M2139 and N jet 32 and N jet 10, respectively, for the rapidly rotating SIMP0136. These values correspond to maximum latitudinal spot diameters of 10 • and 36 • for 2M2139, and 6 • and 18 • for SIMP0136. Thus, slower, jupiter-like wind speeds would lead in small maximum features sizes (6-10 • ), while high speeds would allow larger features (18-36 • ). While we can</figDesc></figure>

We proceed by identifying the best-fit atmosphere models for our two targets with the assumption that these models would well describe the dominant surface type on the targets. Then we explore what secondary surface types have to be added to account for the observed color-magnitude variations by adding a second model atmosphere. We base our analysis on the state-of-the-art radiative-convective model atmospheres in and out of chemical equilibrium described in Burrows et al. (2006) and Madhusudhan et al. (2011), but also used an independent set of models by (Allard et al. 2011) to verify that our conclusions are model-independent. The Burrows models include different empirical descriptions of the vertical structures of clouds of different condensates (Burrows et al. 2006). For each condensate the vertical particle distribution is approximated by a combination of a flat cloud shape function and exponential fall-offs at the high-and low-pressure ends. The cloud altitudes are defined by the intersects of the temperature-pressure profile and the condensation curves. The tested models included cloud shape functions with constant vertical distribution of particles above the cloud base (B-clouds, qualitatively consistent with the DUSTY models described in Allard et al. 2001), and different parameterizations of the generic cloud shape function (A, C, D, E in Burrows et al. 2006). Of particular interest is cloud type E, a generic cloud with very steep exponential fall-offs corresponding to thin clouds thought to be typical to clouds composed of a single refractory condensate's large grains. The spectra we explored ranged in temperature from 600 K to 1,800 K with steps of 100 K, included solar and 10× sub-solar metallicities, and log g=4.0 and 5.0 for the Burrows et al. 2006 models and log g=4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 for the Allard et al. 2001 models.</figDesc></figure>

We note here that the lightcurve modeling is only sensitive to the varying surface components, because homogeneously distributed features will not introduce brightness variations. Thus, it is likely that the large patches deduced from the light curve are not the only features present in the photosphere. Reinforcing this possibility is the fact that color-magnitude modeling based on model atmospheres (Section 3.3) suggests similar level of asymmetry but on top of a more symmetric component.

(2012) have shown that by combining data over a broad wavelength range -where different wavelengths probe different atmospheric depths -the vertical structures of the clouds can be explored. In their study five atmospheric layers of a T6.5 dwarf's were sampled by obtaining five complete light curves at depths ranging from 0.1 to ∼10 bar. An important and surprising result of their study was a significant and pressure-dependent phase difference in the atmosphere with the largest phase shift observed at the deepest level exceeding 180 • . While a full analysis like that carried out by Buenzli et al. (2012) is beyond the scope of this paper, we show in Fig. 7 that the same narrow-band light curves as used by those authors, when extracted from our spectral series, show no significant phase shift. Thus, while the results of the T6.5 brown dwarf suggest correlated large-scale vertical-horizontal structures, the two early-T dwarfs studied here show similar cloud structures at different layers without phase differences.</figDesc></figure>

Similarly to the hot jupiter studies, in an upcoming study Heinze et al. (ApJ, submitted) use precision Spitzer photometry complemented by ground-based near-infrared lightcurve to explore cloud properties on an early L-dwarf. Most recently, (Buenzli et al. 2012) have found pressure-dependent phase shifts in multi-band light curves extracted from HST spectral series and a Spitzer 4.5 µm light curve of a T6.5 brown dwarf, revealing vertical structure in an ultracool atmosphere for the first time. The method used here is a logical next step in these brown dwarf studies, where a large time-resolved spectral set is used to to identify the diversity, spatial distribution, and spectra of the key photospheric features. Further similar studies with space-based instruments on HST and Spitzer, complemented by sensitive ground-based photometric observations, will allow obtaining data similar to those presented here on brown dwarfs -32 - covering a much broader range of atmospheric parameters. Such a dataset will allow the exploration of the properties of cloud cover with spectral type, surface gravity, and rotation period, an important step toward establishing a physically consistent picture of condensate clouds. Next-generation adaptive optics systems will also be capable of measuring relatively small photometric variations in directly imaged giant exoplanets, allowing comparative studies of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets (Kostov &amp; Apai 2012). The changes observed in SIMP0136, first reported in Artigau et al. (2009) and also seen in our Fig. 2, also highlight another exciting question. Cloud covers in some brown dwarfs clearly change on very short timescales on very significant levels, offering an opportunity to study the atmospheric dynamics of ultracool atmospheres via multi-epoch, multi-timescale, multi-wavelength observations.</figDesc></figure>

Analysis of the spectral variations shows that a linear combination of only two types of spectra can explain the variance observed in both sources, demonstrating the presence of a single type of photospheric features in an otherwise homogeneous cloud cover. We find that light curves derived from narrow wavelength sections of the spectra all change in phase. The observed variations show that the near-infrared brightness of dusty brown dwarfs can decrease significantly (3-27%) with only a modest reddening in the J-H color. These changes and extrapolation from the atmospheric models fitting them closely -33 - resemble the properties of red and "underluminous" directly imaged exoplanets, arguing for thick clouds causing the underluminosity of giant planets. Our models with large cloud thickness variations and correlated temperature variations (300 K) explain the observed light curves (amplitudes, color-magnitude changes) as well as the light curve structures. Our findings reinforce models that explain the underluminosity of directly imaged super-jupiters with large scale height dusty atmospheres. The technique applied here, rotational phase mapping, provides a powerful tool to study the atmospheres of ultracool objects, brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Cooler objects may harbor clouds of particles with various composition (NH 3 , CH 4 , H 2 O) and phase (solid or liquid), the presence of which can be inferred with this technique. Its full potential, however, can be achieved with a telescope like James Webb Space Telescope, which will couple high sensitivity and broad wavelength coverage with high contrast, enabling spectrally and spatially resolved mapping of directly imaged exoplanets.
