			<abstract>
				<p>The high angular resolution technique of non-redundant masking (NRM) or aperture masking in-terferometry (AMI) has yielded images of faint protoplanetary companions of nearby stars from the ground. AMI on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)&apos;s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectro-graph (NIRISS) has a lower thermal background than ground-based facilites and does not suffer from atmospheric instability. NIRISS AMI images are likely to have 90-95% Strehl ratio between 2.77 and 4.8 µm. In this paper we quantify factors that limit the raw point source contrast of JWST NRM. We develop an analytic model of the NRM point spread function which includes different optical path delays (pistons) between mask holes and fit the model parameters with image plane data. It enables a straightforward way to exclude bad pixels, is suited to limited fields of view, and can incorporate effects such as intra-pixel sensitivity variations. We simulate various sources of noise to estimate their effect on the standard deviation of closure phase, σ CP (a proxy for binary point source contrast). If σ CP &lt; 10 −4 radians-a contrast ratio of 10 magnitudes-young accreting gas giant planets (e.g., in the nearby Taurus star-forming region) could be imaged with JWST NIRISS. We show the feasibility of using NIRISS&apos; NRM with the sub-Nyquist sampled F277W, which would enable some exoplanet chemistry characterization. In the presence of small piston errors, the dominant sources of closure phase error (depending on pixel sampling, and filter bandwidth) are flat field errors and unmodeled variations in intra-pixel sensitivity. The in-flight stability of NIRISS will determine how well these errors can be calibrated by observing a point source. Our results help develop efficient observing strategies for space-based NRM.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent direct detections of exoplanets open a spectroscopic window into the atmosphere and physics of young and adolescent exoplanets. They are an important component for piecing together a complete picture of exoplanetary formation and evolution, and are complementary to indirect detections methods. Young and nearby stars have already been surveyed from a few Astronomical Units of physical separation outwards with direct imaging and coronagraphs on eight meter class telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Wahhaj et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Nielsen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Biller et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vigan et al. 2012</ref>) and are being surveyed at even higher contrast with current ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Oppenheimer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Macintosh et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beuzit et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Martinache &amp; Guyon 2009</ref>) instrument surveys utilizing extreme adaptive optics (ExAO). However, the close environs of young systems in stellar formation regions are only accessible to ExAO systems using interferometric techniques such as non-redundant mask (NRM) interferometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lacour et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Kraus &amp; Ireland 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cieza et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Huélamo et al. 2011</ref>). NRM imaging is fundamentally limited by photon noise, so it yields moderate contrast. By comparison, coronagraphs (which suppress light from the bright central object) are capable of delivering higher contrast than NRM, but their search area does not reach as close in as that of NRM. The two techniques are complementary.</p><p>NRM was first used to improve the angular resolution of filled-aperture telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baldwin et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Haniff et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tuthill et al. 2000)</ref>. Its improved dynamic range helped to probe the physics of binaries at moderate contrast ratios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lloyd et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ireland et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bernat et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Martinache et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Martinache et al. , 2007</ref>. More recently, NRM observations of star forming regions have discovered structures associated with the birth of exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kraus &amp; Ireland 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cieza et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Huélamo et al. 2011</ref>). Routine ground contrast ratio limits for NRM are 10 2 − 10 3 with the deepest contrast being ∆L =7.99 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Hinkley et al. 2011</ref>). Today instruments combine NRM with ExAO systems <ref type="bibr">(Sivara- makrishnan et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zimmerman 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zimmerman et al. 2012</ref>). These facilities, together with wide bandpass polarization or integral field unit spectroscopy (IFS) in the YJHK bands on the 8 m Gemini South telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Macintosh et al. 2014</ref>) as well as 2.5-5 µm NRM on the 40K James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST NIRISS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Doyon et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Green- baum et al. 2013a</ref>), promise to extend planet formation science by enabling deeper dust penetration at longer wavelengths. These new systems will enable detection of very young (e.g. Taurus-Auriga star forming region), possibly accreting gas giant planets at small separations accessible to NIRISS NRM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beichman et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In spite of the wealth of recent observational results from NRM, the literature does not include extensive discussion of the fundamental and practical limits associated with the technique. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lacour et al. (2011)</ref> discussed empirical sensitivity limits of VLT NACO Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM), based on experiments with the image plane fitting routine that we study here. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Martinache (2010)</ref> showed how NRM can be generalized to full aperture imaging in the high Strehl ratio regime. Ireland (2013) discussed some of the limiting factors of high contrast NRM observations, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Hinkley et al. (2011)</ref> conducted deep NRM observations of the known multiple planetary system HR 8799.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we continue the development of the image plane approach to analyzing NRM data. We address field of view, pixel sampling, plate scale and pupil magnification stability, and some detector properties. We show that this method typically confirms the photon noise and flat field accuracy limits presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ireland (2013)</ref>. In addition, we study other factors that limit NRM contrast -requirements on the spectral type match between a target and its calibrator star, and the effect a finite spectral bandpass has on closure phase errors. Second, we highlight factors that limit JWST NIRISS NRM, which fields a 7-hole NRM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2012</ref>). NIRISS has the best pupil image quality of all the JWST instruments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bos et al. 2008</ref>), which makes it JWST's best-suited instrument for aperture masking interferometry. In addition, NIRISS's homogenous aluminum bench and optics should help achieve uniform contraction of mechanical and optical surfaces as the instrument cools to its operating temperature of about 40K. NIRISS's all-reflective design philosophy also mitigates against chromatic effects, which can be exacerbated by cryogenic conditions. Finally, some relevant properties of NIRISS NRM are described in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BACKGROUND</head><p>( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) A non-redundant mask is a pupil plane mask typically located at a re-imaged pupil plane. It possesses several usually identical holes arranged so that no two hole-to-hole vectors are repeated (thus providing a nonredundant set of baselines in the pupil). If its holes are circular, with diameter d when projected back to the primary mirror, at a wavelength λ its point-spread function (PSF) or interferogram is contained in an Airy pattern </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil Plane</head><p>Three-hole NRM <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Pupil masks and their interferograms. Small holes produce a large PSF envelope, fringed by interference through multiple holes. The longest baselines provides finer resolution than a full aperture. The three hole pupil at right can provide a closure phase measurement of a celestial object.

The interferogram's fine structure is due to the 21 baselines generated by the 7 holes. The PSF envelope reflects the hexagonal hole shape.</p><p>envelope with a first dark ring of diameter 2.44 λ/d <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure 1)</ref>. This envelope is modulated by fringes with half period θ = λ/2B for each baseline. Here B is the hole separation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> shows the JWST NIRISS mask with seven hexagonal holes, and its PSF.</p><p>The Fourier transform of the detected in-focus twodimentional image intensity array is the array of complex visibility, V. Because of the baselines' non-redundancy, the fringe amplitude and phase for each baseline or "two hole interferometer" component in the NRM can be measured unambiguously. The array of complex visibilities for a point source through unaberrated optics is the autocorrelation of the pupil mask. The resulting array of complex visibilities form localized splodges ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lloyd et al. 2006</ref>) of signal in the transform domain -conceptually one independent splodge (or a spodge and its dependent, Hermitian "mirror splodge") per baseline. Numerical Fourier data analysis approaches measure fringe phases and fringe amplitudes, often at the peak of each splodge amplitude ( <ref type="bibr">Tuthill et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lloyd et al. 2006</ref>). When using a finite bandwidth filter, selecting a single ampli-tude and phase to characterize a polychromatic fringe implicitly averages over the bandpass. Furthermore, since windowing in the image plane leads to convolution in the Fourier domain, this induces a second form of averaging within a splodge. Our image plane approach avoids this second form of averaging, but it does perform a conceptually similar averaging over the bandpass. In the absence of wavefront aberration, fringe phases for an on-axis point source are zero. Information on source structure is contained in the fringes that are extracted from the image.</p><p>The non-redundancy of baselines in the pupil leads to constraints on the complex fringe visibilities. A closure phase (the cyclic sum of fringe phases around the baselines formed by three holes (top right, <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>) is insensitive to constant wavefront delays (pistons) over the holes. The fringe formed by interference of holes i and j has a fringe phase φ i,j which is proportional to the wavefront delay between holes φ i,j ≡ φ j − φ i . For a point source (in the absence of higher order aberrations) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Readhead et al. 1988</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆φ 1,2 + ∆φ 2,3 + ∆φ 3,1 = (φ 1 − φ 2 ) + (φ 2 − φ 3 ) + (φ 3 − φ 1 ) = 0 (1)</formula><p>Full-aperture images do not yield closure phases, but sufficiently high Strehl ratio images possess certain constrained linear combinations of phases of the Fourier transform of the image <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Martinache 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Martinache , 2011</ref>). These combinations, or kernel phases, are useful for model fitting data when wavefront aberrations are below ∼ 1 radian <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Martinache 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ireland 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Pope et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>An N -hole mask has N (N − 1)/2 baselines, N (N − 1)(N − 2)/6 closure phases, and (N − 1)(N − 2)/2 independent closure phases. Empirically, achievable dynamic range is approximately the inverse of the standard deviation of closure phase error, 1/σ CP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lacour et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Closure phases of centro-symmetric sky brightness distributions are zero. Binary or multiple point source models are fit to closure phase data to provide information on structure as fine as λ/2B. Instrumental contributions to closure phases are measured (in principle) by observing a point source. These contributions are then subtracted from a target's closure phases. Instrument stability between target and calibrator leads to improved NRM performance. In addition to fringe phases, a space telescope is likely to provide stable fringe amplitudes. Closure amplitudes (a ratio of amplitudes of fringes formed by four holes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Thompson et al. 1986</ref>)) are useful in simple model fitting using space-based NRM data, thereby extending NRM model fitting to include centro-symmetric structure such as circular disks. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ford et al. (2014)</ref> use simulated noisy NIRISS NRM data to extract the fringe amplitudes and phases which they then use to recreate the input target scene with interferometric resolution. They found that enforcing closure quantities on image plane data leads to an increase in spurious image artifacts.</p><p>Currently numerical Fourier methods are the most common approach to NRM data analysis (e.g. Monnier 2003; <ref type="bibr">Tuthill et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Kraus &amp; Ireland 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ireland et al. 2008)</ref>. This is suited to fields of view that encompass the first few Airy rings of the NRM PSF's "primary beam" (the diffraction pattern of a single hole), and pixel scales that are significantly finer than λ/2D. Palomar Hale's PHARO, Keck-NIRC2, and VLT's NACO all possess 3-5 pixels per resolution element <ref type="bibr">(Metchev &amp; Hillen- brand 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ireland et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tuthill et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ire- land et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Girard 2013</ref>). With such super-Nyquist fine pixellation, Fourier methods easily identify and interpolate over isolated bad pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ireland 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Diffraction-limited exoplanet imagers deploying stateof-the-art ExAO systems now feed IFSs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Oppenheimer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Macintosh et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>). These imaging spectrographs typically have limited fields of view since several detector pixels are required for each image plane pixel spectrum, and the angular extent of each image plane lenslet is at or below the diffraction limit of the telescope, so the instruments are often limited by the number of available detector pixels. NRM on these hyperspectral imagers -Palomar's P1640 (Zimmerman 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Zimmerman et al. 2012</ref>) and Gemini Planet Imager ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Greenbaum et al. 2013b</ref>) -must deal with this limitation. An image plane based approach (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lacour et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cheetham et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Greenbaum et al. 2013a</ref>) is insensitive to these restrictions on the field of view.</p><p>Future space-based NRM on JWST NIRISS (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. ,b, 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">Green- baum et al. 2013a</ref>) is implemented on coarse pixel scales. Under these conditions a numerical Fourier data reduction approach may require more data in order to reduce contamination by bad pixels. This is more relevant to coarse -barely or sub-Nyquist -pixel scales. Dithering to fill the image plane pixels with valid data decreases observing efficiency and complicates estimates of noise. An image plane based approach sidesteps the requirement of knowing every pixel value in the image. The image plane approach is also robust to detector non-linearities that may occur at the centers of NRM images, since suspect pixel data can be discarded. JWST NIRISS's coarse pixel scales also increase its sensitivity to non-uniform sensitivity within a pixel (intra-pixel sensitivity, or IPS), and pixel-to-pixel variations in IPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Hardy et al. 2008</ref>). Image plane data reduction can take IPS into account, with a map of measured variations or a model of the pixel sensitivities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Greenbaum et al. 2013a</ref>).</p></div>

Wavefront errors {φ i , i = 1, ..., N } that are constant within each of the apertures decenter each fringe by (φ i − φ j ). Such errors are termed pistons. Pistons do not move the image centroid, since the intensity centroid is the mean of the phase gradient over the (uniformly illuminated) pupil forming an in-focus image <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Teague 1982)</ref>, and piston errors do not change the mean wavefront slope. A piston difference between two holes shifts the fringe away from the image centroid (or pointing center ) by an angle, the fringe phase. A shift from one fringe maximum to the next is interpreted as an angle of 2π. Given JWST NIRISS' anticipated image quality during normal operations, we expect fringe phases of point source NRM images to lie well inside the half-open interval <ref type="bibr">(−π, π]</ref>.

Since NIRISS point source calibration involves systemwide complexities we defer study of it here. NRM paired with the sub-Nyquist sampled F277W filter should provide about 7.5 magnitude raw contrast, which could be useful for probing water absorption features.</p><p>Identifying outlying image pixels is straightforward with our analytical model fit. Our algorithm also makes for more efficient observing strategies since missing pixel data do not need to be filled in with dithered observations. Pixel-to-pixel variation in sub-pixel scale differences is easily incorporated in a statistical or detailed manner in our model fit approach, and saturated pixels can be ignored in the fit. This is relevant to NIRISS, with its barely-Nyquist pixel scale and JWST's limited lifetime.</p><p>Flat field errors of 0.1% limit raw monochromatic contrast to a few ×10 −4 . Precise positioning of the target and calibrator on the same pixel will reduce the effect of flat field errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2009a</ref>). Knowledge of intra-pixel sensitivity can be used to improve astrometry and reduce fringe phase measurement errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Greenbaum et al. 2013a</ref>). Intra-pixel sensitivity (IPS) variations over the detector limit contrast, especially for the shorter wavelength NIRISS F277W and F380M filters. However, knowledge of the IPS can ameliorate this. We demonstrated that a statistical understanding of IPS variations can help markedly.

Raw contrast from F277W observations will be reduced because of its wider bandpass, and because F277W will see higher instrument WFE at its shorter wavelength. However, with the anticipated WFE for JWST, its bandpass should not be the limiting factor for contrast. The primary contrast limiting factors are pixel-to-pixel (flat field) variations and IPS variation for the coarsest sampled F277W filter. In comparison contrast will be largely unaffectected by uncertainty in source spectrum if the modeled bandpass roughly matches the data. While these various systematics limit raw contrast, additional sensitivity will be possible through point-source calibrations and leveraging stable closure amplitudes.</p><p>Flat field errors can also effect closure phase measurements from IFS images. but higher order wavefront error from atmospheric effects may be the biggest limiting factor on the ground. These higher order errors certainly exist on ground-based instruments like GPI, and may contribute amplitude as well as phase errors. JWST NIRISS' wavefront error is expected to be dominated by low order terms, and stay below about 160 nm rms. Fitting uncorrelated pistons with our analytic model is robust The theoretical closure phases for a single binary companion predict a required contrast ≈ 1/σCP empirically. The plot shows σCP over all possible triangles through NIRISS F277W and F430M filters. If F277W observations can reliably measure closure phase below 10 −3 , they could detect the K signal of the companion structure around LkCa15, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Kraus &amp; Ireland (2012)</ref>. Two of their three companion sources lie between λ/2D and λ/D at 2.77 µm.</p><p>to low-order wavefront errors including tip and tilt. A thorough study of the effects of higher-frequency wavefront error in the NRM PSF is warranted.</p><p>Space-based NRM presents opportunities for extended object imaging at high angular resolution. Centrosymmetric structures require amplitude measurements, which will be stable in the absence of atmospheric effects. Space-based NRM's fringe phase and amplitude measurements provide true imaging, which can benefit AGN and quasar science <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ford et al. (2014)</ref>, so our image plane model could improve observing efficiency and data reduction methods for space-based high resolution imaging. An analytic point source model is a step towards more sophisticated forward-modeling of NRM data.  Note. -This rough estimate uses typical operating temperatures (273K for a ground-based telescope and 50K for JWST and NIRISS, and assumes that the thermal background for the ground-based telescope is entirely due to warm mirrors. On JWST NIRISS the entire opaque mask area will be the dominant source of thermal background. We use an emissivity of 0.1 for the warm Keck mirrors, and a system efficiency of 0.5 for both cases. and 480M filters provide sufficiently fine sampling on its 65 mas pixel scale detector. NIRISS is Nyquist sampled at 4 µm. We have demonstrated reduced but still scientifically interesting capability for NIRISS's NRM when used with the wide band F277W filter as well. A viewer located at the secondary mirror and looking at the reflective surface of the primary mirror would see this mask projection and segment arrangement. The centers of the 18 segments (designated A1-6, B1-6, and C1-6) are labelled. The NRM's holes are nominally centered on the segment they expose. The holes are 0.8 m flat-to-flat when projected back to the primary mirror. The average segment flat-to-flat distance is approximately 1.32 m if there were no inter-segment gaps. The mask's holes are undersized so as to stay within the parent segment in the presence of a linear pupil misalignment of up to 3.8% of the diameter of the pupil's circumscribing circle, viz., 6603.5 mm at operating temperature (Lightsey, private communication, Beaulieu, private communication). All these numbers will need to be refined when the as-built pupil distortion is measured on the ground and in flight. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> shows a rough comparison of the estimated thermal backgrounds assuming Keck-NIRC2's 9-hole mask and JWST NIRISS' 7-hole masks in many of the filters that are used with their NRMs. We assume that the ground-based mask itself is cooled, so does not contribute to the thermal background. Ground-based NRM is restricted to brighter adaptive optics guide stars, is limited by thermal background longward of 3 µm, but delivers better angular resolution than NIRISS' NRM. On the other hand, JWST NIRISS' NRM extends to 4.8 µm with no appreciable thermal background, so it should be able to observe much fainter targets than are available to instruments such as Keck-NIRC2 NRM. We note that thermal background limits Keck-NIRC2's L and M s filters to exposures of the order of 0.27 and 0.14 seconds respectively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
