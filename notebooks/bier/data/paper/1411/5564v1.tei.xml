				<p>The carbon-silicate cycle regulates the atmospheric CO 2 content of terrestrial planets on geological timescales through a balance between the rates of CO 2 volcanic outgassing and planetary intake from rock weathering. It is thought to act as an efficient climatic thermostat on Earth and, by extension , on other habitable planets. If, however, the weathering rate increases with the atmospheric CO 2 content, as expected on planets lacking land vas-cular plants, the carbon-silicate cycle feedback can become severely limited. Here we show that Earth-like planets receiving less sunlight than current Earth may no longer possess a stable warm climate but instead repeatedly cycle between unstable glaciated and deglaciated climatic states. This has implications for the search for life on exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>It is generally thought that the carbon-silicate cycle acts as a stabilizing feedback and a powerful thermostat for the Earth climate, guaranteeing surface liquid water conditions. Above freezing temperatures, rock weathering occurs faster at higher temperatures, which reduces the CO 2 atmospheric partial pressure, pCO 2 , and cools down the climate. Conversely, on a frozen planet that temporarily lacks weathering, atmospheric CO 2 builds up from continued volcanic outgassing, which warms up the climate until surface liquid water and weathering conditions are restored <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Such pCO 2 build up is in fact the leading scenario for the deglaciation of Earth following a snowball event <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Generalizations of these concepts to Earth-like planets around other stars are central to the definition of their liquid water habitable zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. In particular, planets subject to modest levels of insolation are expected to achieve temperate conditions with liquid water at the surface by building up massive enough CO 2 atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Experimental data, theoretical arguments and paleoclimate modeling suggest that the rate of CO 2 intake via rock weathering by a planet lacking land vascular plants increases with the atmospheric CO 2 content, pCO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. This feature of lifeless planets or planets with only primitive forms of life is important because it will limit the buildup of CO 2 at high values. As a result, the climate thermostat due to the carbon-silicate cycle should become less efficient on weakly-insolated Earth-like planets located in the outer regions of the habitable zone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Climate-Weathering Models</head><p>To address this issue quantitatively, we model Earth-like climates with a zero-dimensional, energy balance model that equates the net insolation and thermal radiation fluxes,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S 4 [1 − α(T surf , pCO 2 )] = OLR(T surf , pCO 2 ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S is the insolation flux, α is the planetary Bond albedo and OLR is the outgoing longwave radiation flux emitted by the planet. OLR and α are functions of the surface temperature, T surf , and pCO 2 , derived from radiative-convective climate models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (see Appendix A for details). While we assume that the climate reaches thermal equilibrium rapidly, by virtue of Equation (1), the slower CO 2 compositional equilibrium is not imposed a priori in our models. Rather, pCO 2 is evolved on the relevant geological timescales according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d dt pCO 2 = V − W (T surf , pCO 2 ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where V is the global CO 2 volcanic outgassing rate (estimated as V ⊕ = 7 bars/Gyr for Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) and W is the rate of CO 2 intake by the solid planet via rock weathering. The functional form of W is adapted from Earth studies for pre-vascular plant conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W W ⊕ = pCO 2 p ⊕ β e [kact(T surf −288)] × [1 + k run (T surf − 288)] 0.65 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where p ⊕ = 330 µbar is the pre-industrial pCO 2 level, W = W ⊕ ≡ V ⊕ for T surf = 288K, k act = 0.09 is related to an activation energy and k run = 0.045 is a runoff efficiency factor. Varying <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> k act in the range 0.06-0.135 and k run in the range 0.025-0.045 has only a minor quantitative impact on our results. Values of β = 0.25-1 have been considered in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> for the dependence of weathering on pCO 2 in the absence of land vascular plants. We use β = 0.5 (default) and 0.25 in this work. Note that equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> are coupled through pCO 2 and T surf .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Steady-State Solutions</head><p>Steady-state climate solutions, satisfying both radiative (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>) and weathering equilibrium (d/dt ≡ 0 in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>) are represented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> by intersecting cooling and heating curves. Solid red lines in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref> show the albedo-corrected insolation flux (LHS of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>) received by a planet located at 1, 1.25 and 1.6 AU from a Sun-like star as a function of surface temperature. 1 Net insolation drops precipitously from 273K to 263K as the planetary surface freezes and the albedo reaches ∼ 0.65. The various blue lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> represent the OLR cooling flux (RHS of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>) according to various scenarios for the atmospheric CO 2 content.</p><p>A standard model with pCO 2 arbitrarily fixed at p ⊕ = 330 µbar (i.e. not constrained by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>) is represented by the slanted solid blue line. As is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, three steady-state climate solutions exist in such a model for an Earth-like planet at 1AU, as indicated by diamonds where the red and blue curves intersect. Earth's current climate (T surf ≃ 288 K) and a globally-frozen state (T surf ≃ 229 K) are both stable, while the intermediate state (T surf ≃ 270 K) is thermally unstable.</p><p>However, when pCO 2 is also required to satisfy weathering equilibrium (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>), steady-state climate+weathering solutions only exist above freezing temperatures since weathering stops operating on a frozen planet. A model including weathering without any pCO 2 dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (β = 0 in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>) is represented by the vertical solid blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In such a model, weathering equilibrium enforces a unique surface temperature, set by requiring that weathering balances volcanic outgassing in Equation (2), and pCO 2 is only indirectly constrained by the constant T surf requirement.</p><p>On the other hand, when the weathering rate depends on both pCO 2 and T surf , noticeable bends appear in the blue cooling curves shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref>. Indeed, in this class of models, the reduced efficiency of weathering at low temperatures must be balanced by large pCO 2 values to match the volcanic outgassing rate V . The weaker the weathering pCO 2 dependence, the stronger is the pCO 2 build-up at low surface temperatures (compare β = 0.5 and 0.25 models represented by the dashed and dash-dotted lines in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, respectively). A planet with a larger volcanic CO 2 outgassing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> achieves a warmer stable climate (T surf ≃ 292 K for V = 3V ⊕ and adopting our default weathering parameters, which is the case shown as a dotted line in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, stable climate+weathering solutions can cease to exist at low insolation levels, such as the 1.25 and 1.6 AU cases shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, for a strong enough dependence of the weathering rate on pCO 2 . For example, we find that blue curves no longer intersect with heating (insolation) lines beyond 1.077 AU if β = 0.5 and beyond 1.25 AU if β = 0.25. Conversely, a very weak weathering dependence on pCO 2 (β &lt; 0.1), including the singular case β = 0 (vertical solid blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), do permit stable climate+weathering solutions at almost arbitrarily low insolation levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Low β values may be the relevant limit for planets where land vascular plants are widespread <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. On the other hand, for values of β ∼ 0.25-0.5 appropriate for planets lacking land vascular plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, the bending of cooling curves seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> also implies that at fixed volcanism rate, V , less insolated planets achieve climate+weathering equilibrium at gradually lower T surf values. For example, in the case β = 0.25 , equilibrium is only marginally achieved above freezing temperatures at 1.25 AU, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. At low enough insolation levels (far enough away from the star), climate+weathering equilibrium is no longer possible above freezing temperatures, which implies that weathering equilibrium is unattainable.</p><p>On planets lacking weathering equilibrium, the climate must repeatedly cycle through a succession of radiative equilibria as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: rapid transition from marginal to full glaciation (A→B, at fixed pCO 2 ), slow build-up of pCO 2 caused by volcanic outgassing in the absence of weathering (B→C), rapid transition to a deglaciated state (C→D, at fixed pCO 2 ) and gradual pCO 2 decay under the action of weathering (D→A), until the cycle repeats again with full glaciation. The general properties of the four critical points A-B-C-D of this climate cycle, which are independent of details of the weathering model, are quantified in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> as a function of orbital distance from a Sun-like star. Blue curves correspond to the coldest cycle point with the lowest pCO 2 value, B, while the red curves correspond to the hottest point with the highest pCO 2 value, D. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows that Earth-like planets at larger orbital distances glaciate and deglaciate at larger pCO 2 values. A deglaciation with pCO 2 ≃ 0.14 bar at 1 AU is consistent with values reported for snowball Earth deglaciation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Planets beyond 1.3 AU support massive (&gt; 0.3 bar) CO 2 atmospheres throughout their climate cycle. Planets in the frozen state have albedos ≃ 0.65, while the albedo of unfrozen planets rises from ≃ 0.3 to 0.45 in the range 1-1.8 AU, from an increasing atmospheric scattering contribution. The extremes of surface temperature along the cycle vary modestly with insolation level, with T surf ≃ 210-225 K at the coldest point and 310-330 K at the hottest point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Climate Cycles</head><p>Explicit time-dependent integrations of the system of Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>-(3) reveal details of the climate cycle illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. We initiated these integrations at the hot, high pCO 2 (weathering-independent) point D and confirmed that Earth-like planets receiving sufficiently large insolation fluxes settle to a steady-state warm climate solution after relaxation to weathering equilibrium. By contrast, planets at large enough orbital distances (low enough insolation levels) experience large amplitude climate cycles, as anticipated from our discussion of equilibrium solutions in relation to <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows six illustrative examples (A-F) of such climate cycles, shown in terms of variable T surf and pCO 2 curves. Most of the cycle time is spent in the frozen state, during which pCO 2 build-up is slow compared to the fast weathering that occurs at above-freezing temperatures. In model 1, 4.6% of the 70 Myr cycle is spent in a warm state with surface liquid water. The corresponding numbers are 0.8% of 477 Myr in model 2, 7.5% of 76 Myr in model 3, 3.9% of 139 Myr in model 4, 28% of 312 Myr in model 5 and 17% of 517 Myr in model 6. Faster weathering at higher T surf also implies that most of the time in the unfrozen state is spent just above freezing temperatures, near the lowest pCO 2 levels covered during the cycle. For a fixed volcanic outgassing rate, V , the climate cycle duration increases with decreasing insolation because larger absolute pCO 2 values must be reached for climate transitions to occur <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Decreasing insolation also reduces the fraction of cycle time spent with surface liquid water by the planet, although this can be compensated for by stronger volcanic outgassing. A weaker pCO 2 weathering dependence (lower β) lengthens the duration of the unfrozen state since the decline in pCO 2 with time has less of an effect on the weathering rate.</p><p>To summarize, a temperature-only dependence of the weathering rate (β = 0) uniquely ties the surface temperature to the volcanic outgassing rate V via Equation (2). A more general dependence on pCO 2 (β &gt; 0) leads to a richer set of climate solutions, including unstable climate cycles at low enough insolation levels, when weathering equilibrium ceases to exist. These results are not specific to the weathering functional form adopted in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>, in the sense that other weathering laws with a positive dependence on pCO 2 and T surf would lead to qualitatively similar climate behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The key new feature of our analysis is the lack of stable climates on Earth-like planets lacking land vascular plants, at low enough insolation levels. This suggests that a subset of Earth-like planets located in the outer regions of habitable zones may be preferentially found in a frozen, rather than deglaciated, state. A globally frozen state might be observationally inferred from the very high albedo and the correspondingly low water content of the planet's atmosphere. According to these results, some Earth-like planets in the outer habitable zone would also be caught in a transiently warm state with surface liquid water present only infrequently.</p><p>The link between unstable climate cycles and the emergence and evolution of life on weakly-insolated Earth-like planets is unclear but possibly important. A reduced amount of time with surface liquid water on planets experiencing climate cycles could in principle slow down the emergence and/or evolution of life. On the other hand, life itself could strongly impact the weathering process on weakly-insolated Earth-like planets, as it seems to have done on early Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. In particular, the ability of land vascular plants to regulate the soil pCO 2 level that is relevant to the weathering process, well above atmospheric pCO 2 levels, is consistent with these plants effectively decoupling the weathering rate from the atmospheric pCO 2 level <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, leading to β → 0 in Equation (3). As a result <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, vertical line)</ref>, the climate of weakly-insolated Earthlike planets could be stabilized against transient cycles once the presence of land vascular plants becomes widespread. This would constitute a strong example of life exerting a feedback on its environment.</p><p>It is worth noting that Earth's geological record is qualitatively consistent with the evolutionary path one may envision for a habitable planet orbiting a star that is gradually brightening over time. Repeated snowball events should be restricted to early times, when insolation is weak and land vascular plants are absent. They should disappear at late times once insolation is strong enough and/or land vascular plants become widespread.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A. Energy Balance Climate Model.</head><p>We model the climate of Earth-like planets with a zero-dimensional reduction of a one-dimensional energy balance model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The model assumes Earth parameters unless otherwise specified (e.g., surface gravity, land/ocean fraction and nitrogen contribution to the total atmospheric mass). Greenhouse effect from atmospheric H 2 O and CO 2 are included, with an atmospheric vapor pressure set by surface evaporation (temperature).</p><p>The top-of-atmosphere albedo and the outgoing longwave radiation flux are modeled as polynomial fits to a large number of radiative-convective models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The polynomial fits are functions of surface temperature, partial CO 2 pressure, solar zenith angle and surface albedo. Simple prescriptions for snow/ice coverage, surface albedo and water cloud coverage are adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For simplicity, we fix the cosine of the zenith angle to µ = 0.4 and the albedo of ice-free oceans to 0.07 in all the models presented here. We also smooth out the top-of-atmosphere albedo polynomials near the 280 K transition to improve the continuity of the albedo function with temperature.</p><p>Based on published results <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we expect that our results would be quantitatively different, but remain qualitatively valid, for planets that differ modestly from Earth in terms of their surface gravity, land/ocean fraction and/or nitrogen atmospheric content. Note that it has been suggested that weathering does not strongly depend on land/ocean fraction on an Earth-like planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The energy balance model employed here may not be fully reliable beyond 1.3-1.4 AU, where CO 2 clouds are expected to form and influence the climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The most massive CO 2 atmospheres found in our models only marginally approach hard limits on CO 2 condensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>). Model 2: Default weathering model at 1.8 AU. Model 3: 3 times larger CO2 outgassing rate at 1.3 AU. Model 4: 3 times larger CO2 outgassing rate at 1.6 AU. Model 5: Weaker pCO2 weathering dependence (β = 0.25) at 1.3 AU. Model 6: Weaker pCO2 weathering dependence (β = 0.25) at 1.6 AU. Increasing the CO2 outgassing rate shortens the duration of the cold, CO2 build-up phase. Weakening the weathering pCO2 dependence (β = 0.25 rather than 0.5) lengthens the duration of the hot weathering phase, resulting in a much larger fraction of time spent with surface liquid water.</p><p>Appendix B. Model Simplifications and Limitations.</p><p>Our models are idealized in a number of important ways. In addition to the simplified, zero-dimensional treatment of climate described above, which suggests the possibility of richer behaviors in higher complexity, threedimensional climate models, our treatment of weathering processes is intentionally simple, in order to isolate they key factors that determine climate stability. We ignore seafloor weathering <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and the mantle CO 2 cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The absolute calibration of weathering rates in the absence of land vascular plants is unknown, but it is thought to be less than in their presence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. For concreteness, we have chosen to calibrate weathering fluxes in our models using current Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>). We note that in a model admitting steady-state solutions, a factor three decrease in the weathering rate is equivalent to a factor three increase in the volcanic outgassing rate (see Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>), which is one of the cases shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (dotted blue line). Such a model retains the main qualitative feature highlighted in this work, which is the disappearance of stable climates solutions at low enough insolation levels (beyond 1.2AU for the dotted blue line shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Different calibrations in weathering rates and/or volcanic outgassing rates will thus affect our results quantitatively, but our main conclusions should remain valid.</p><p>More generally, a planet is likely to change its weathering regime gradually over time, as different forms of life emerge and spread over its surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Our models have intentionally focused on the distinction between the absence and presence of land vascular planets, which exemplifies the interplay between life, weathering processes and climate stability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :Figure 3 :</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Climate at global radiative equilibrium for an Earth-like planet.

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Even though the planetary albedo α in Equation (1) depends on pCO2, we find that this dependence is quantitatively negligible for pCO2 ≪ 0.2 bar. For simplicity, we plot heating (red) curves in this low pCO2 limit in Figure 1, which is indeed satisfied by all the cooling (blue) curves shown. All our other results fully account for the α-pCO2 dependence.</note>
