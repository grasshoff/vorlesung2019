			<abstract>
				<p>Based on the interstellar CO/H 2 ratio, carbon monoxide-based censuses of protoplanetary disks in Lupus, σ Orionis, and Chamaeleon I found no disks more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula, which is inconsistent with the existence of exoplanets more massive than Jupiter. Observations and models are converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70% and 99.99% over 2 Myr of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO 2 dissociation. In highly ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue emission see the highest ionization rates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The properties of protoplanetary disks set the conditions for planet formation, and the workhorse molecule for determining disk masses and turbulent speeds has been CO and its rarer isotopologues. Observations are sometimes interpreted by assuming that all carbon is in gas-phase CO inside a freeze-out radius (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Williams &amp; Best 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ansdell et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ansdell et al. , 2017</ref>. However, the chemical models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aikawa et al. (1997)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bruderer et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Favre et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yu et al. (2016)</ref> predict that CO abundances are much lower than the interstellar value even inside the freeze-out radius, an effect we call chemical depletion. Along with other factors that affect the emission from commonly observed CO transitions, this chemical depletion can lead to underestimation of disk masses by large factors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Miotello et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Miotello et al. , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Molyarova et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yu et al. 2017a</ref>). The chemical depletion also affects tracers of disk turbulence like the peak-to-trough ratio; not accounting for chemical depletion can cause disk turbulence to be underestimated ( <ref type="bibr">Yu et al. 2017b</ref>). Turbulent diffusion can also deplete CO from the warm molecular layer, as CO gas from downward-sinking eddies freezes onto the grains, which grow too large to diffuse back up into the warm molecular layer and release the CO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu et al. 2017</ref>). Significant CO depletion has been seen in other models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Furuya &amp; Aikawa 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Reboussin et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Drozdovskaya et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eistrup et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eistrup et al. , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schwarz et al. 2018</ref>); though differing in details, the models agree that CO is likely to be depleted inside the freeze-out radius.</p><p>The conclusion that CO is chemically depleted depends on the disk's chemical composition evolving on a timescale comparable to disk lifetime. The CO chemial evolution is driven by ionization from cosmic rays, X-rays, and radionuclide decay. Yet the cosmic ray ionization rate inferred from primitive solar nebula abundances <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Umebayashi &amp; Nakano 2009)</ref> may not represent all protoplanetary disks: <ref type="bibr">Cleeves et al. (2013a)</ref> suggest that magnetic fields in stellar winds can create a "T-Tauriosphere", screening cosmic rays. Also, young stars have a wide range of X-ray fluxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Garmire et al. 2000)</ref>, and X-ray luminosity may vary in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Robrade &amp; Schmitt 2006</ref>. Our goal is to test how a disk's CO abundance distribution depends on the dominant ionization mechanism and the ionization rate.</p><p>Here we present a suite of models of chemically evolving protostellar disks with different ionization rates. All other disk properties are kept constant. In §2, we describe the ionization rates ζ(R, z) used in our calculations. In §3, we discuss the CO abundance calculated for each ionization profile. In §4, we demonstrate that increasing CO abundance in the inner disk combined with CO depletion beyond 20 au, but inside the CO ice line occurs for all of our models, which have ionization rates consistent with X-ray observations and inferred cosmic-ray fluxes for the solar nebula and nearby planet-forming disks. We present our conclusions in §5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DISK MODELS AND IONIZATION RATES</head><p>Our model disk has mass 0.015M contained within a 70 AU radius. Disk evolution begins when the central star, which has mass 1M , is 0.1 Myr old, roughly the beginning of the T-Tauri phase (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kristensen &amp; Dunham 2018)</ref>, and the star evolves along the Hayashi track throughout the 3 Myr of disk evolution according to the models of D <ref type="bibr">'Antona &amp; Mazzitelli (1994)</ref>. The fiducial model rates for ionization are fully described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yu et al. (2016)</ref>. Here we summarize them. Ionization by ultraviolet radiation is negligible except for the very surface layer of the disk. X-rays are able to reach most of the disk, producing an ionization rate around 10 −17 s −1 in the disk interior, except for the dense inner 10 AU near the disk midplane. If magnetic shielding is neglected, cosmic rays provide an ionization rate of 10 −17 s −1 in nearly all of the disk, with only minor attenuation in the inner midplane. We experiment with decreases of factors of 10 to 100 in both X-rays and cosmic rays. We also consider increases of a factor of 10 in each. Decreases in the total ionization rate by more than a factor of 100 are not realistic because the decay of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) such as <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Al can provide an ionization rate on the order of 10 −19 s −1 to 10 −18 s −1 ( <ref type="bibr">Cleeves et al. 2013b</ref>). Roughly speaking, X-rays dominate the ionization rate where the vertical column density is less than a few g cm −2 , while cosmic-ray ionization dominates the disk interior. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the total ionization rate ζ(R, z), including both cosmic rays and X-rays, as a function of disk location. We do not consider time-varying ionization: ζ(R, z) stays constant in time, consistent with a star that lacks accretion bursts and is not near evolving massive stars. Future work should at least explore time-varying X-ray flux, as was observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Robrade &amp; Schmitt (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Robrade &amp; Schmitt (2007)</ref>. A numerical summary of the models at a single location in the disk, R = 38 au and z = 0, is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The first column lists the name for the model, and the rest of the columns show the rates for ionizing reactions 1-5 (listed below) and the fractional electron abundance f (e) = N e − / (N H + 2N H2 ) at t = 0. These rates and free electron abundances allow simple comparisons of the effects of the different models. The ionizing reactions that initiate the chemical reaction network leading to CO chemical depletion are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CRP + H 2 → H + + H + e − (1) CRP + H 2 → H + 2 + e − (2) X + H 2 → H + 2 + e − (3) CRP + He → He + + e − (4) X + He → He + + e − ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where CRP is a cosmic-ray particle and X is an X-ray. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the reactions in the ion chemistry network that affect the CO abundance. Input of ionizing particles is shown in red. The three ions shown in blue destroy the CO molecule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">He + + CO → O + C + + He (6) H + 3 + CO → HCO + + H 2 (7) CH + 5 + CO → HCO + + CH 4<label>(8)</label></formula><p>While He + is produced directly from cosmic-ray or X-ray ionization of helium, CH + 5 and H + 3 come from charge exchanges initiated by ionization products H + and H + 2 . Although the HCO + produced by reactions 7 and 8 can be  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for an explanation of the model names.</p><p>recycled to re-form CO (e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">HCO + + e − → CO + H or HCO + + C 2 H 2 → CO + C 2 H + 3 )</formula><p>, we find that CO destruction dominates throughout most of the disk. C + , a product of reaction 6 (shown in purple in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), can feed back into the CO destruction network by reacting with H 2 . Reaction products that do not participate directly in ionization-driven CO destruction are not shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CO ABUNDANCES</head><p>Here we examine snapshots of our model disks after 2 Myr of disk evolution, about the median age of stars in Taurus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand 2009)</ref>. In the fiducial model (presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yu et al. 2016</ref>), CO depletion begins to noticeably affect the outer disk (R &gt; 40 au) by ∼ 1 Myr, and after 2 Myr the CO abundance has developed strong gradients in R and z. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the CO fractional abundance distribution f CO (R, z), where a Model names syntax: CR/10 has 1/10 th of the cosmic ray-driven ionization rate and the same X-ray-driven ionization rate as the fiducial model; XR×10 has the same cosmic ray-driven ionization rate and 10 times the X-ray-driven ionization rate as the fiducial model; etc. exact ionization-rate threshold at which CO destruction kicks in. While Bosman et al. see no ionization-driven CO depletion for ζ CR &lt; 5 × 10 −18 , we find midplane CO abundances that are at least a factor of three lower than the ISM value of f CO = 10 −4 (Parvathi et al. 2012) at R &gt; 15 au in all simulations-even in model CR/100, which has ζ CR = 1.3 × 10 −19 at the disk surface. We also find factor-of-few CO depletion beyond 15 AU in low-ionization models XR/100 and CR/10,XR/10. The disappearance of CO in the outer disk seems to be a robust conclusion. Do any astrophysical disks receive lower X-ray or cosmic-ray fluxes than represented in our simulations, possibly allowing CO gas to remain intact? In the fiducial model, the X-ray ionization rates are set according to the prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bai &amp; Goodman (2009)</ref> and are normalized using an overall X-ray luminosity of L X = 2 × 10 30 erg s −1 , typical of a solar-mass star in the Taurus star-forming region ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Garmire et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Telleschi et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Robrade et al. 2014</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f CO = N CO / (N H + 2N H2 ) (f CO (R, z) = 10 −4 at t=0</formula><p>The XR/100 model would therefore represent a star with L X = 2 × 10 28 erg s −1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Telleschi et al. (2007)</ref> find a positive correlation between X-ray luminosity and stellar mass, so that the only stars in their sample with L X 2×10 28 erg s −1 have M 0.1M . We conclude that we are not overestimating the X-ray fluxes of young solar-mass stars.</p><p>For cosmic rays, <ref type="bibr">Cleeves et al. (2013a)</ref> predict that the T-Tauri magnetosphere strongly attenuates the incoming flux. They suggest that the maximum reasonable value of ζ H2 CR , the ionization rate per H 2 molecule at the surface of a disk, in a magnetic environment similar to the heliosphere is 1.4 × 10 −18 s −1 . In the "T-Tauriosphere" created by a typical magnetically active young star, Cleeves et al. find ζ H2 CR 10 −20 at the disk surface. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Umebayashi &amp; Nakano (2009)</ref>, our fiducial disk has ζ H2 CR = 1.3 × 10 −17 s −1 at the disk surface, which exponentially decreases toward the midplane over a surface-density scale length of 96 g cm −2 . In our CR/100 model, which has the lowest incident cosmic-ray flux of any of our simulations, the cosmic ray-driven ionization rate is still a factor of 10 above what Cleeves et al. recommend. It is possible that we are over-predicting the amount of chemical depletion caused by cosmic rays. However, since short-lived radionuclides-which are not included separately in our simulations-provide an ionization rate of ζ RN ∼ (1 − 10) × 10 −19 s −1 at the disk midplane ( <ref type="bibr">Cleeves et al. 2013b</ref>), they would become the dominant ionization source in the disk interior in our CR/10, CR/100, and CR/10,XR/10 models. We thus conclude that the range of midplane ionization rates we simulate is physically realistic, even if the exact ionization source is unknown.</p><p>With a starting mass of only 0.015M within 70 au of the star-halfway between the minimum-mass solar nebula models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Weidenschilling (1977)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hayashi (1981)</ref>-the disk model presented here is designed more for comparison with observations than for realistic giant planet formation. While <ref type="bibr">Yu et al. (2017a)</ref> found that the combined effects of CO depletion in the outer disk, optically thick emission in the inner disk, and the fact that the CO is not well modeled by a single temperature combine to underestimate the mass of even this low-mass disk, they also presented chemical models and synthetic observations of a disk with 0.03M within 70 au. The higher-mass disk follows the same chemical evolution pathway as the disk studied here, but with a time lag. After being irradiated by cosmic rays and X-rays for t and t + 0.5 Myr, respectively, the 0.015M and 0.03M disks have almost the same intensity ratios of C 18 O/ 13 CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2, which are used as mass diagnostics in the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Williams &amp; Best (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Miotello et al. (2016)</ref> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Yu et al. (2017a)</ref>). The effects of ionization-driven chemistry are cumulative: given a long enough radiation-exposure age, any disk should eventually lose most of its gaseous CO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RADIAL RE-DISTRIBUTION OF CO</head><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, we see that CO depletion in the outer disk is the most obvious consequence of continuous exposure to ionizing radiation over million-year timescales. What is less obvious is that after an initial ∼ 0.5 Myr period of depletion, the CO abundance near the disk surface in the inner 10 au recovers to reach its initial value of 10 −4 by ∼ 1.5 Myr. Although the star's dimming as it evolves along the Hayashi track cools the disk enough to freeze most of the CO 2 , there is a layer of CO 2 gas at the warm disk surface at R &lt; 15 au. This gaseous CO 2 layer provides the raw material for the CO abundance rebound along the surface of the inner disk:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">He + + CO 2 → CO + + O (9) C + + CO 2 → CO + + CO (10) H + CO + → CO + H + .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Here we quantify the evolving radial distribution of the CO molecule. We use the metric M &lt;20 /M ≥20 , the ratio of the CO gas mass contained inside R = 20 au to the CO gas mass located outside 20 au. (Note that the disks simulated here have outer boundaries at R = 70 au.) As our disk begins its evolution, roughly equal portions of the CO gas reside inside and outside the circle with radius 20 au. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows M &lt;20 /M ≥20 as a function of time. Even in model CR/10,XR/10, which has the lowest ionization rate of all our simulated disks, we still find that most of the CO resides inside 20 au after several million years of evolution. The higher the ionization rate (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>), the more the CO becomes concentrated in the inner disk over time.</p><p>Our results suggest that the CO emitting area could be an indirect indicator of ionization rate: for disks of similar ages (i.e. those in the same star-forming region), those with the most centrally peaked CO emission (as measured in rare isotopologues such as C 18 O and C 17 O) might see the highest flux of ionizing radiation. For example, spatially resolved observations of the disk surrounding TW Hya show that the CO column density drops precipitously as a function of radius, and that the drop occurs well inside the CO snow line ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schwarz et al. 2016</ref>). The concentration of CO in the inner disk plus the overall low CO abundance (f CO ≤ 2.5 × 10 −6 everywhere in the disk; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bergin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Favre et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cleeves et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schwarz et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2018</ref>) suggest that CO may be succumbing to ionization-driven depletion. To help distinguish between a CO-depleted gas disk and a disk with interstellar CO/H 2 but small radial extent, we recommend comparing the radial extents of the C 18 O (J=3-2 or J=2-1) and dust continuum emission. While many disks have 12 C 16 O haloes that extend well into the surrounding molecular cloud, spatially resolved observations of the CO-depleted disks IM Lup and TW Hya show that C 18 O has a similar extent to the dust disk (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cleeves et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schwarz et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2018)</ref>. Disks that appear much wider in C 18 O than in millimeter dust continuum should not be CO-depleted. For unresolved but inclined disks, wide line profiles can indicate that the inner disk dominates the CO emission: in our fiducial model, the velocity width of the CO J = 3 − 2 line doubles over the course of 3 Myr of evolution as the CO becomes more and more confined to the inner disk ( <ref type="bibr">Yu et al. 2017a</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. M&lt;20/M ≥20 , the ratio of the CO mass inside 20 au to the CO mass outside 20 au. Even in the models with the lowest ionization rate, most of the CO is concentrated in the inner disk after 3 Myr of evolution. Disks with the highest ionization rates have the most uneven radial distribution of CO.</p></div>

In two well-resolved disks with observations in multiple CO isotopologues-TW Hya, discussed in §4, and IM Lup ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cleeves et al. 2016</ref>), comparison of thermo-chemical models with data suggests that CO abundances are at least a factor of 20 below interstellar.</p><p>To our prediction of CO chemical depletion beyond ∼ 20 au, even in disks with lower X-ray or cosmic-ray ionization rates than the "standard" values (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Garmire et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Umebayashi &amp; Nakano 2009)</ref>, we add that the radial distribution of CO may serve as an indirect tracer of ionization rate. In our higher-ionization models (Fiducial, CR×10, XR×10), gradual dissociation of CO 2 gas raises the CO abundance in the inner 15 au of the disk, even as the molecule is destroyed in the outer disk. The end result is a CO abundance distribution that is sharply peaked in the inner disk.</p><p>This paper does not include any experiments with grain surface properties, size distributions, or radial drift. While the reactions that lead to CO dissociation happen in the gas phase, the reason that gaseous CO does not re-form is because the constitutent atoms get locked into hydrocarbons, which then freeze out on grain surfaces. Yet grain growth, drift, and settling can lead to gaseous hydrocarbon ring formation at the outer edge of the pebble disk, where the opacity is low and UV photons can penetrate the full gas column ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bergin et al. 2016</ref>). Our models should not be used to predict the behavior of either CO or hydrocarbons in parts of the disk where the gas-to-solid ratio is more than an order of magnitude different than the canonical value of 100 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yu et al. 2016)</ref>. Radial drift of cm-size pebbles followed by CO desorption can also deplete the outer disk of CO gas (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Krijt et al. 2018</ref>), an effect we have not explored. We also do not investigate disks with dust traps, pressure maxima, or inner holes, though it is becoming increasingly clear that few astrophysical disks have smooth, power-law surface density distributions (e.g. van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marel et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Casassus et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhang et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">van der Marel et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Canovas et al. 2016)</ref>. While this work presents a useful framework for analyzing the relationship between CO abundance and ionization rate, models of astrophysical disks require require additional complexity to accurately reproduce observations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
