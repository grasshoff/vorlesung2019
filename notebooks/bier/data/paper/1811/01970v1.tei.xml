				<p>We consider the potential for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to detect transit timing variations (TTVs) during both its nominal and extended mission phases. Building on previous estimates of the overall yield of planetary systems from the TESS mission, we predict that during its nominal two-year mission, TESS will observe measurable TTVs in ∼ 20 systems, from which O(1) planet will get precise mass measurements from TTVs alone, ∼ 4 planets will have significant constraints placed on their masses from TTVs, and a dozen systems will be singly-transiting TTV systems. We consider a number of different extended mission scenarios, and predict that in a typical scenario, an extended mission will allow TESS to increase the number of systems with measurable TTVs to a total of ∼ 90, from which ∼ 5 planets will have precise mass measurements, ∼ 25 will have significant constraints placed on their masses, and ∼ 60 will be singly-transiting TTV systems. We also describe how follow-up transit observations of multi-planet systems discovered by the TESS mission can be optimally planned to maximize TTV mass and eccentricity constraints.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Transit timing variations (TTVs) are a powerful tool for measuring masses and eccentricities in planetary systems with multiple transiting planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holman &amp; Murray 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hol- man et al. 2010</ref>). The precise, long-term photometric observations of the Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) allowed detection of timing variations in a large sample transiting systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mazeh et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holczer et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ofir et al. 2017</ref>). These timing variation measurements enable mass and eccentricity measurements of small planets in multi-transisting systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2017)</ref>, often in cases that would otherwise be inaccessible to traditional radial velocity methods. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>) represents the next generation in spacebased photometric transit surveys and will present new opportunities for TTV mass and eccentricity measurements. Measuring masses for 50 planets smaller than 4 R ⊕ is a Level 1 Science Requirement of the TESS Mission. 1 Therefore, it is of interest to know the degree to which TTV mass determinations can contribute mass measurements of TESS discoveries.</p><p>Ballard (2018) provides a simplified prediction for the expected TTVs among TESS discoveries by applying an empirically-derived, multiplicitydependent TTV probability from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xie et al. (2014)</ref>, estimating that ∼5% of TESS discoveries will exhibit TTVs. However, Ballard (2018) does not consider the amplitude of such TTVs, whether they would be detectable with the timing precision derived from TESS photometry, and to what degree they can be used to derive dynamical constraints. The central aim of this work is to address these issues and estimate the expected yield of mass and eccentricity measurements from TTVs of TESS discoveries.</p><p>1 https://tess.mit.edu A significant contributory factor to the detection and utilization of TTVs in the Kepler data was the observing strategy used by the mission:</p><p>Kepler stared continuously at the same relatively small (∼ 100 sq. deg.) field of stars for ∼ 4 years, generating an approximately continuous data set of photometric observations for its ∼ 10 5 target stars. In contrast, the TESS mission will cover the majority of the sky during its two year mission, using 27 day-long stares at stripes of the sky covering ∼ 24 • × 96 • . These stripes are then rotated about the ecliptic pole, generating a coverage pattern in which regions close to the ecliptic receive only 27 days coverage during the year, while only a small region near the ecliptic pole experiences continuous coverage. Full-frame image (FFI) data from each stripe will be taken on a 30 minute cadence, while data for "postage stamp" regions of the specific pixels surrounding ∼ 15, 000 targets per stripe will be downloaded at 2 minute cadence.</p><p>TESS's significantly shorter time baselines, relative to Kepler, will make deriving dynamical constraints from TTVs more difficult for many multiplanet systems. But short observational baselines do not necessarily preclude the possibility of extracting useful information from TTVs measured with TESS. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rodriguez et al. (2018)</ref> constrain two planetary masses using just nine TTV data points that cover a single planet-planet conjunction. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldberg et al. (2018)</ref> show that it will be possible to combine TESS's short time baseline observations with previous Kepler observations to refine dynamical constraints for a handful of TTV systems.</p><p>An extension of the TESS mission beyond its nominal two years of operation could provide longer observational baselines and improve the opportunities for dynamical TTV constraints. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouma et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huang et al. (2018a)</ref> recently discussed the expected benefits of various extended TESS mission scenarios in terms of the overall number of planet discoveries, finding that an extended mission could yield ∼ 2000 new planet detections per additional year of operation. An important goal of this work is to quantify the expected improvements to TTV dynamical constraints under various extended mission scenarios.</p><p>In this paper we investigate TESS's expected yield of dynamical TTV constraints by generating a synthetic population of planetary systems, simulating their transit timing variations, and analyzing the dynamical information contained in their TTV signals. We explore how various extended mission scenarios improve the overall yield of dynamical constraints. We also investigate how follow-up transit observations of multi-transiting systems can be effectively planned to optimize TTV dynamical constraints.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the population of synthetic planets we use in our investigation, and the synthetic TTVs we ultimately derive from these. In Section 3 we describe the TTV model we use to fit the synthetic TTV data. In Section 4 we present the expected results from the nominal mission as well as various extended mission scenarios. In Section 5, we highlight the ability of our model to plan effective follow-up observations of transiting planets, even in systems that exhibit no appreciable TTVs during the nominal TESS mission. Finally in Section 6 we discuss our results and conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SYNTHETIC OBSERVATIONS</head><p>TESS began science operations in July 2018. However, while the first few exoplanet discoveries are beginning to be announced (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Huang et al. 2018b</ref>), it will take several years until a reasonably large sample of planets and candidate planets is available. Therefore, for this work we need to synthesize a reasonable set of transit signals that might be expected to be detected by TESS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Synthetic Observations: Stellar and Planetary Population</head><p>The generation of the synthetic population of planetary systems follows the same basic procedure employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref>. We provide a broad outline of the procedure here and detail some modifications to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref>'s original procedure that we make in order to more accurately model the architectures of multi-planet systems. We refer the reader to the original text for more details. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref> simulated planets around stars in version 6 of the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) Candidate Target List (CTL). There are a total of 3.8 million stars in this catalog and all have computed stellar properties such as mass, radius and brightness. Of these 3.8 million, 3.2 million were computed as observable to TESS, and were assumed to be observed by the mission using the 30-min integration time Full-Frame Image mode. From these, 214, 000 were assumed to be observed using the spacecrafts 2-min cadence mode. The stars observed at 2-min cadence were selected using the CTL prioritization metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stassun et al. 2018</ref>), but we forced the stars to be evenly distributed over the observing sectors.</p><p>We modify <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref>'s method for assigning planets to host stars in order to more accurately capture the architectures of multi-planet systems since planets' spacings strongly influence their TTVs. In particular, we aim to reproduce the period-ratio distribution of multi-planet systems inferred from Kepler using the de-biased periodratio distribution derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steffen &amp; Hwang (2015)</ref>. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref>, we begin by assigning each star in the sample a number of planets drawn from a Poisson distribution. AFGKdwarfs were drawn assuming a mean of λ = 0.689 for periods ≤ 85 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>), while M−dwarfs are drawn assuming λ = 2.5 for periods ≤ 200 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>. Next, we assign periods and radii to the innermost planet from the measured period-radius distribution of planets from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref> for AFGK-dwarfs and from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2015)</ref> for M−dwarfs. We differ from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref> by drawing the periods of subsequent planets in the system from the period-ratio distri-bution in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steffen &amp; Hwang (2015)</ref>. Planets in a single system are drawn iteratively, the period ratio being with respect to the previous outer-most planet at each step. Radii of these subsequent planets are drawn from the appropriate period bins of the inferred period-radius distributions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2015)</ref>. Because giant planets almost never occur in multitransiting systems, planets in multi-transiting systems initially assigned radii larger than 6 R ⊕ are re-assigned new random radii from the periodradius distribution until a radius smaller than 6 R ⊕ is drawn.</p><p>The eccentricities of the planets were assumed to follow a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter σ e = 0.02, consistent with the eccentricity distribution of Kepler multi-planet systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Eylen &amp; Albrecht 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Xie et al. 2016</ref>). The inclination of the innermost planet was drawn from a distribution uniform in cos i, where i is the inclination with respect to the plane of the sky. All additional planets in any multi-planet system have relative inclinations with respect to the innermost planet drawn from a Rayleigh distribution with scale parameter σ i = 2 • , then multiplied by either 1 or -1, chosen randomly. This inclination selection strategy mimics the mutual inclination distribution seen in Kepler's multis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fang &amp; Margot 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fabrycky et al. 2014a</ref>). Finally, each planet is assigned a mass randomly drawn using <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen &amp; Kipping (2017)</ref>'s probabilistic mass-radius relationship code, 'FORCASTER'.</p><p>We perform a basic check for stability of the multi-planet systems by determining whether each system's adjacent planet pairs satisfy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hadden &amp; Lithwick (2018)</ref>'s criterion for stability in twoplanet systems. We remove 10 systems from our sample that host adjacent planet pairs predicted to be chaotic and unstable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Synthetic Observations: Detection Modeling and Transit Time Uncertainties</head><p>Having generated our sample of planetary systems, we use the detection model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref> to determine which stars host at least one planet that is expected to be detectable by TESS. In brief, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. (2018)</ref>'s detection model determines which planets will have transit detections with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 7.3 based on their transit properties, the predicted TESS photometric noise level (dependent on their host star's brightness, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stassun et al. 2018)</ref>, and the flux contamination reported in the CTL. Applying the detection model, we find a total of 4635 stars host one or more planet with detectable transits. Of these 4635 stars, 1861 host more than one planet. These multi-planet systems are the focus of our TTV study. We note that the stellar hosts of the multi-planet systems are split such that 453 are MDwarfs, and 1408 of earlier type.</p><p>Of the 1861 multi-planet systems, 136 are multi-"tranet" systems (Tremaine &amp; Dong 2012) containing two or more planets with detected transits while the other 1725 are single-"tranet" systems in which only one of the planets exhibit detectable transits while the other planets either do not transit or have transits below the SNR≥ 7.3 threshold. These systems are detected in both 2-min cadence data and 30-min cadence FFI data: of the 1861 multi-planet systems, 763 are in the 2-min cadence in the nominal mission, while 1098 are in the FFI data.</p><p>In order to study what dynamical information may be gleaned from transit timing variations, we need an estimate of the precision with which TESS will be able to measure transit mid-times. Building on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carter et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carter et al. ( , 2009</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Price &amp; Rogers (2014)</ref> developed analytic expressions to approximate the uncertainties in various quantities derived from transit fitting as functions of planet properties and photometric precision. Their formula for the uncertainty in mid-transit times can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">σ tc = σ δ τ 2 ×    1 − I 3τ −1/2 , if τ ≥ I 1 − τ 3I −1/2 , if τ &lt; I (1)</formula><p>where σ is the uncertainty of individual TESS photometric measurements, δ is the planet's transit depth, I is the cadence (i.e., 2 minutes for preselected TESS targets and 30 minutes for planets discovered in the FFIs), and τ is the ingress time. We use Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> to estimate the expected transit mid-time uncertainty, σ tc , for each planet in our sample, by combining the photometric uncertainty, σ, of the host star with the transit depth, duration, and ingress times computed from the planet's radius and orbital properties. <ref type="bibr">Gold- berg et al. (2018)</ref> demonstrate that Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> accurately predicts the precision of transit mid-time measurements when transit SNRs are sufficiently high (SNR 3, see their Appendix A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Synthetic Observations: TESS Schedule / Coverage</head><p>A central aim of this work is to predict the expected improvements to the detection of TTVs in TESS data (and the mass measurements that can be extracted from these data) under various extended mission scenarios. We consider four distinct 3-year extensions of the TESS mission, which we summarize in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Our extended mission scenarios cover two possible camera configurations: the first, C 4 , has camera 4 centred on the ecliptic pole as in the nominal mission. The second, C 3 , has camera 3 centered on the ecliptic pole and provides a larger area of sky with multiple pointings, at the expense of coverage near the ecliptic equator. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huang et al. (2018a)</ref> refer to this configuration as 'C3PO'.) We also consider two possible extended mission pointing sequences: one in which TESS remains pointed in the northern ecliptic hemisphere for the entire extended mission (NNN) and one in which TESS alternates hemispheres each year after starting in the north (NSN).</p><p>We approximate the TESS sky footprint as a rectangular region spanning 24 deg ×96 deg in ecliptic longitude and latitude in order to determine which planets are observed during the various extended missions considered. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N Baseline C 4 SN E 4,NSN Extended C 4 NSN E 4,NNN Extended C 4 NNN E 3,NSN Extended C 3 NSN E 3,NNN Extended C 3 NNN</formula><p>We ignore any potential TTVs of planets that are not detected during the nominal mission but later discovered during the extended mission. We do not expect such planets to contribute significantly to TESS's TTV yield for the same reasons they are missed during the nominal mission: either their transits are of low SNR and therefore their transit mid-times will be measured with poor precision or their orbital periods are longer than their nominal mission observational time-baseline and they will have only a few transits during an extended mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Synthetic Observations: TESS TTV Sample</head><p>To synthesize TTVs, we perform N-body simulations of the 1861 multi-planet systems from Section 2.2 that contain at least one transiting planet detected during the nominal TESS mission. We use the TTVFast code of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deck et al. (2014)</ref> to conduct our N-body simulations, which include all planets in a given system, both transiting and nontransiting. Planets' initial mean anomalies are selected randomly from a uniform distribution. For simplicity, we assume all planets lie in the same plane in our dynamical integrations since the small mutual inclinations typical of multi-planet systems (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fang &amp; Margot 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Figueira et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fabrycky et al. 2014b</ref>) have negligible influence on planets' TTVs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2016)</ref>. We integrate each simulation for 5 years and record the times of mid-transit for every transiting planet. In order to generate statistics we repeat 50 simulations for each system, drawing new random mean anomalies each time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">TTVs as a linear combination of basis functions</head><p>Planets' TTVs can, to a good approximation, be treated as linear combinations of basis functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Linial et al. 2018</ref>). These basis functions depend only on planets' periods and are thus known when all dynamically relevant planets in a system transit. Specifically, the nth transit of the ith planet is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">t i (n) = nP i + T i + j =i µ j δt (0) i, j (n) + (Z i, j δt (1) i, j (n) + c.c.)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P i is the ith planet's period, T i sets the time of the ith planet's first transit, µ j is the planet-star mass ratio of the jth planet,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Z i, j ≈ e j e iϖ j − e i e iϖ i √ 2 (3)</formula><p>is the "combined complex eccentricity" of planets i and j as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hadden &amp; Lithwick (2016)</ref> where e i and ϖ i are the eccentricity and argument of pericenter, 'c.c.' denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term, and δt (0) i, j and δt (1) i, j are TTV basis functions that capture the TTV induced by the jth planet. It will frequently be convenient to refer to δt <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> i, j 's real and imaginary components separately as δt <ref type="bibr">(1,x)</ref> i, j and δt <ref type="bibr">(1,y)</ref> i, j , respectively. A leastsquares fit of a planet's TTV yields one real and one complex amplitude, µ j and µ j Z i, j , for each perturbing planet. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> 2 Strictly speaking, the TTV model in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref> is nonlinear because the TTV basis functions δt (0) and δt (1) depend</p><p>The TTV basis functions, δt <ref type="formula">(0)</ref> i, j , t <ref type="bibr">(1,x)</ref> i, j and t (1,y) i, j , can be computed using a perturbative solution of the planets motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2016)</ref> or extracted from numerical integrations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Linial et al. 2018</ref>). Higher-order terms in Z i, j can also be included as needed using the perturbative method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hadden &amp; Lithwick (2016)</ref>. Details on computing the TTV basis functions are given in Appendix A.</p><p>A least-squares fit of a set of transit times provides the joint distribution of the basis function amplitudes µ, µRe <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>, and µIm <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref> as a multivariate normal distribution. The quantities of interest in most applications will instead be µ and Z ≡ |Z|, who's joint distribution can be obtained from the integral</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P(µ, Z) = µ 2 Z 2π 0 N(µ, µZ cos θ, µZ sin θ)dθ (4)</formula><p>where N(·) is the Gaussian joint probability density of the TTV amplitudes, µ, µRe <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>, and µIm <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>, derived from the least-squares fit and the prefactor of µ 2 Z comes from the Jacobian of the variable transformation (µ, µRe <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>, µIm <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>) → (µ, Z, cos θ).</p><p>TTV parameter inference is frequently hampered by a degeneracy between planet masses and eccentricities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lithwick et al. 2012</ref>). This is because, often, the basis functions δt (0) and δt <ref type="bibr">(1,x)</ref> are both approximately sinusoids with identical phases. Consequently, there is a strong anti-correlation between the inferred amplitudes of these two basis functions, µ and µ Re <ref type="bibr">[Z]</ref>.</p><p>The TTVs of two or more planets are determined by fewer free parameters than assumed by a linear model approach. Consider the TTVs of an interacting pairs of planets: The TTVs are determined by on the planets' periods, P, and initial transit times, T . However, in most cases, planet periods and initial transit times can be determined iteratively, first determining periods by fitting planets' transit times with strictly linear ephemerides then successively refitting transit times as combinations of linear ephemerides and the TTV basis functions constructed from planet periods determined at the previous iteration. 4 free parameters (two planet-star mass ratios and two components of the planets' Z). However, the linear model includes 6 independent TTV amplitudes: two planet-star mass ratios and two complex numbers of the form µZ. Simply fitting two linear models to a pair of planets' TTV ignores the fact that the same combined eccentricity components appear in the basis function amplitudes of both the inner and outer planet. Therefore, the linear model approach will likely over-estimate the uncertainties in planet parameter constraints in some situations.</p></div>

Only knowledge of the planets' periods and initial orbital phases, which come directly from observations, is required to determine the TTV basis functions, and hence Σ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>We search the synthetic catalog of transit times (described in Section 2) for systems that show significant TTVs. We begin by reducing our synthetic transit time catalog to those systems that could exhibit detectable TTVs under any of the mission scenarios considered. To do so, we reduce the catalog to those systems in which one or more planets shows significant timing residuals, after removal of the best-fit linear ephemeris from the full 5-year simulated data set. 3 After computing the χ 2 values of timing residuals, we retain systems containing at least one planet with timing residuals that are inconsistent with Gaussian noise at &gt; 95% confidence in multi-planet systems or &gt; 99% in singlytransiting systems. When computing χ 2 values, timing uncertainties for years 3-5 are assigned assuming 2-minute cadence observations. under the assumption that anything discovered in the nominal missions will subsequently be transitioned to 2-minute cadence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Multi-tranet systems</head><p>After our initial selection of possible TTVs (described above), we attempt to identify multi-tranet systems with significant TTV signals, in which the TTVs can be attributed to interactions among the observed planets. Such systems are generally the richest targets for TTV analysis since mass measurements can yield density constraints for the observed planets. To identify these systems, we fit the transit times of every multi-tranet TTV system in our catalog via least-squares with the linear model described in Section 3. Interactions between planets separated by a period ratio greater than P /P &gt; 2.2 are ignored in the least-squares fits. These linear models account only for those planets that are observed to transit and ignore any potential non-transiting or undetected perturbers. We do not fit the TTVs of planets for which our analytic TTV model is under-determined due to insufficient transits. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> After fitting a multi-tranet system's TTVs with our linear model, it falls into one of three categories:</p><p>1. Category-1 systems yield direct mass measurements. The system hosts at least one planet for which a δt (0) TTV component amplitude is non-zero at &gt; 1σ confidence. This means that one or more planet's TTV constrains the mass of its perturbing companion(s).</p><p>2. Category-2 systems exhibit significant TTVs, but mass inference is hampered by a masseccentricity degeneracy. For one or more planets in the system, the error ellipse defined by best-fit TTV amplitudes and their co-variance matrix excludes 0 at &gt; 2σ confidence. However, all δt (0) amplitudes are consistent with 0, so the planets' masses are The best-fit analytic TTV models are also plotted in gray. The bottom panels show joint constraints derived from the TTVs for the planet-star mass ratio and the combined eccentricity, |Z|, by plotting 1, 2 and 3σ contours derived using Equation (4).

Category-3 systems show significant timing residuals but are poorly fit by the analytic model. The planets timing residuals, after subtracting off the best-fit analytic model, indicate a poor fit which we define as a χ 2 value inconsistent with random Gaussian noise at &gt; 3σ significance. The poor fits are either due to unseen additional perturbers or to effects not captured by the analytic TTV model (such as proximity to 2nd or higher order resonances). In some instances of the latter case, it may be possible to extract dynamical mass constraints from the TTVs. This category also includes significant signals for which the analytic model is under-determined. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows representative TTVs from the first two categories. For planets in Category-1, the TTV will provide a measurement of the perturbing companion's mass as well as the planet pair's combined eccentricity. Planets in Category-2 exhibit a degeneracy between the perturber mass and eccentricity. An independent measurement of the perturber's mass, e.g., via radial velocity, can yield eccentricity constraints in such systems. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> plots the masses and radii of the TTV detections from one of the 50 realization of our synthetic TTV catalog. The left-hand panel shows the results of the nominal mission: two mass measurements derived from Category-1 TTVs as well  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.

The extended mission yields four additional Category-1 mass measurements and improves the precision of the two mass measurements obtained during the nominal mission. The extended mission also adds 14 new Category-2 planets along with five Category-3 systems. (After the three additional years of the extended mission, the two Category-2 systems identified during the nominal mission show significant residuals not captured by the analytic model, re-classifying them as Category-3 planets.) All but two of the detected TTVs are induced by planets smaller than 4R ⊕ . <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarizes the predicted yields of detected TTV systems, separated into the above classifications, in both the nominal and extended mission scenarios. We list the median, minimum, and maximum number of planets falling within each category from the 50 simulation iterations randomized in planets' initial orbital phases. Overall, the various extended mission scenarios yield similar numbers of TTV detections, though extended missions that alternate hemisphere (NSN) provide a slight advantage over continuous monitoring of a single hemisphere (NNN) in the number of both Category-1 and 2 TTVs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Single-tranet TTVs</head><p>In addition to the multi-transiting TTV systems described above, TESS is expected to discover a number of singly-transiting planets that exhibit TTVs. While such TTVs generally offer little information beyond an indication of additional planets in the system, it may be possible to extract dynamical constraints in some instances (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Category</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Summary of the expected TTV yields for different TESS mission scenarios as defined in Section 2.3. Listed are the median, minimum, and maximum number of planets,taken from the 50 iterations of our synthetic TTV catlog, that fall within each of categories defined in Section 4.1 as well as the number of singly-transiting planets exhibiting significant TTVs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nesvorný et al. 2013</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarized the number of such systems whose transit timing residuals are inconsistent with Gaussian random noise at &gt; 3σ for various mission scenarios. In all mission scenarios, the expected number of singly transiting TTV planets outnumbers the total combined multi-tranet systems in Categories 1,2, and 3 by more than a factor of two. Many of the multi-planet systems hosting singletranet TTV planets contain additional transiting planets whose transits fall below TESS's 7.3 SNR detection criterion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 4</ref> shows the transit SNRs of 'undetected' transiting companions to the single-tranet TTV planets discovered in various mission scenarios. Many such companions could be recoverable upon relaxing the 7.3 transit SNR requirement. If these planets are responsible for the TTV of the initiallydetected planet then the TTVs could yield dynamical constraints on the mass and eccentricities of these planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">PLANNING FOLLOW-UP TRANSIT OBSERVATIONS</head><p>In section 4 we summarized the yield of TTV measurements based solely on transits times derived from TESS photometry. Here we briefly consider how improved dynamical constraints can be obtained by combining TESS data with follow-up  transit observations from other space-or groundbased facilities. The linear TTV model's ability to project the expected precision of planet parameter constraints is particularly useful in planning effective follow-up observations of multi-planet systems. We demonstrate that follow-up observations can be planned to successfully extract mass measurements even for systems that exhibit no appreciable TTVs during the nominal TESS mission. This is best illustrated by way of an example.</p><p>The top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows the TTV of a hypothetical planet on a 10 day orbit perturbed by an exterior perturber near a 4:3 MMR with a mass of 3 × 10 −5 M * and a combined eccentricity of Z ≈ 0.01. The system is observed for three successive TESS sectors (82.2 days) during the nominal mission. The transits observed during the nominal mission are sufficient to precisely determine the periods and initial transit times of the planet pair but do not yield dynamical constraints on planet masses and eccentricities. In fact, during the nominal TESS mission, these planets have such small timing residuals that they do not meet our criteria for selection in any of the categories described in Section 4. However, the periods and initial transit times determined from the TESS observations fully determine the TTV basis functions, δt (0) and δt <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> . The value of these basis functions at any proposed set of future follow-up transit observations, along with the expected mid-time precision of the follow-up observations, are sufficient to compute a covariance matrix, Σ, defined in Equation 7. This covariance matrix determines the precision with which the TTV basis functions' amplitudes are expected to be measured, and thus, the expected precision with which the perturbing planet's mass and the combined eccentricity would be constrained.</p><p>The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows predictions for how precisely the perturbing planet's mass can be determined if additional transit observations are obtained. Each point in the bottom panel shows the expected standard deviation in a measurement of the δt (0) basis function amplitude, corresponding to the perturbing planet's planet-star mass ratio, for hypothetical sets of follow-up observations of consecutive transit taken at different times. The different color points correspond to follow-up observations spanning 3, 5, or 10 consecutive transits measured with 3 minute mid-time uncertainty. Optimal times for follow-up, i.e., those that yield the smallest resultant σ µ values, are highlighted. These optimal times clearly correspond to locations in the TTV signal where a short-period 'chop- ping' signal is evident. We emphasize these that optimal follow-up times can be predicted from the nominal-mission data alone. This example serves to illustrate the potential importance of photometric follow-up observations to the overall TTV yield of TESS. In this particular example, a follow-up observation spanning just 5 judiciously chosen transits of the planet would be sufficient to yield a measurement of the perturber's mass at a significance of ∼ 3σ despite a lack of significant TTV signal over the course of the nominal TESS mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The main goal of this work has been to provide a quantitative estimate of TESS's potential to detect transit timing variations (TTVs) and determine the dynamical constraints on planet masses and eccentricities that can be derived from these variations. We summarize our findings:</p><p>1. The TESS mission's TTV yield after completion of its nominal mission will likely be modest, providing only a handful of significant TTV signals in multi-transiting systems, of which O(1) can be expected to yield a direct measurement of a planet's mass, not subject to a mass-eccentricity degeneracy (i.e., a Category-1 TTV, as defined in Section 4.1). Additionally, we expect approximately a dozen singly-transiting planets with significant TTVs will be identified in the nominal mission.</p><p>2. A three-year extension of the TESS mission can significantly enhance the number of TTV systems that provide dynamical constraints. We expect an extended mission to yield ∼ 30 significant TTVs in multitransiting systems (i.e., the total number in Categories 1, 2, and 3 in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), of which ∼ 5 will yield a direct planet mass measurement. The number of significant TTVs is relatively insensitive to the choice of extended mission observing strategy, though alternating hemispheres (NSN) yields slight more TTVs than continuous observation of a single hemisphere (NNN). In addition, ∼ 60 TTVs of singly-transiting planets will be identified. Such TTVs will, in a number of instances, reveal transiting companions that do not meet the formal 7.3 SNR threshold for detection but that nonetheless may be recovered from the light-curve <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig- ure 4)</ref>.</p><p>One of the primary science objectives of the TESS mission is to determine masses for 50 planets smaller than 4R ⊕ . An extended mission could allow TTV mass measurements to contribute significantly towards this goal. In addition to projecting the yield of dynamical constraints derived from TESS observations alone, we described how follow-up transit observations of discoveries can be optimally planned to yield dynamical information. The ultimate contribution of such observations to the overall TTV yield of TESS will depend on the availability of follow-up resources, both ground-and space-based, and the photometric precision that can be achieved.</p><p>TTV signals have a complicated and sensitive dependence on planetary systems' orbital architectures. Therefore, imperfect knowledge of the underlying distribution of multi-planet system architectures is a source of uncertainty in our predicted yields. We have attempted to use the best available constraints from the literature when drawing planet properties such as radii, masses, periods, and eccentricities to generate our synthetic planetary system population. However, possible correlations between these parameters will influence our expectations for the TESS mission's TTVs and remain poorly quantified. Recent works based on the sample of Kepler multi-planet systems have shown that planets in the same system tend to be similar in size ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Weiss et al. 2018</ref>) as well as mass <ref type="bibr">(Mill- holland et al. 2017)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhu et al. (2018)</ref> find evidence that lower-multiplicity systems tend to be dynamically hotter. Our synthetic planet population has not attempted to incorporate these correlations. Our lack of knowledge is especially acute for systems orbiting around M-dwarfs, which are under-represented in the Kepler sample (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Hu- ber et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>The methodology we develop in this work can be applied to plan follow-up transit observations to constrain planet masses as well as to evaluate the TTV yield of observing strategies of future transit survey missions such as PLATO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rauer et al. 2014)</ref>. The linear TTV model should also prove useful for exploring joint con-straints attainable from the combination of TTV and RV measurements. For example, independent mass constraints from RV measurements can break the mass-eccentricity degeneracy in a TTV system so that the TTVs yield a direct measurement of combined eccentricity, Z (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Petigura et al. 2018</ref> Here we describe our method for computing the basis functions used in our linear TTV model.

Note that the oscillating parts of elliptic functions are given by {K(x|m)} osc. = K(x|m) − 2x π K(m) (A21) {E(x|m)} osc. = E(x|m) − 2x π E(m) (A22) where K(m) and E(m) are complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively. Agol et al. (2005) derive a similar closed-form expression for δλ in their TTV formulae (see also Malhotra 1993). Inserting (A14) into (A12), the equation of motion for z(t) to 0th order in eccentricity is given by dz dt = 2in µ √ α α 2 + α cos ψ + 2iα sin ψ 1 + α 2 − 2α cos ψ 3/2 + α 2 cos ψ + iα sin ψ exp [iλ] .</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> In reality, no star is observed for the entire 5-year data set under any of the mission scenarios, so this is a conservative selection criterion.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> The analytic model is under-determined for planets with fewer than 2 + 3N pert transits. We still account for the perturbations of such planets on their companions showing a sufficient number of transits.</note>
