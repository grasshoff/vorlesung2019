			<abstract>
				<p>Hi-resolution spectroscopy (R ≥ 25, 000) has recently emerged as one of the leading methods to detect atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking in a robust method to extract quantitative constraints on temperature structure and molecular/atomic abundances. In this work we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework applicable to high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) that relies upon the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework on simulated data and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on atmospheric temperatures and abundances allowing for a quantitative exploration of the inherent degeneracies. Furthermore, our new framework permits us to trivially combine and explore the synergies between HRCCS and low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS) to provide maximal leverage on the information contained within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of molecular line opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209 458 b and HD 189 733 b and retrieve abundant carbon monoxide but sub-solar abundances for water, largely invariant under different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these datasets, but is possibly at odds with detections of H 2 O at different wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The framework presented here is the first step towards a true synergy between space observatories and ground-based hi-resolution observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The field of exoplanet characterization has matured to the point where we can begin to answer fundamental questions regarding planetary climate, composition, and formation, and provide context for understanding our own solar system planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Madhusudhan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Burrows 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bailey 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crossfield 2015</ref>). The community has leveraged the power of ground-and spacebased observatories to find and characterize a diverse range of planets, ranging from hot giants to terrestrialsized, potentially habitable worlds. Atmospheric characterization has emerged as key area of intense focus as of late because the atmosphere is the most readily accessible part of a planet via remote observations. The most scientifically valuable measurements of exoplanet atmospheres are those constraining their composition and temperature changes with altitude, ideally as a function of orbital phase. The most stringent constraints so far come from observations with low resolution spectroscopy (hereafter LRS, at a resolving power R = λ/∆λ ≤ 200), primarily with the Hubble ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Evans et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Haynes et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Knutson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kreidberg et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mandell et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Stevenson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deming et al. 2013</ref>) and Spitzer Space Telescopes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grillmair et al. 2008</ref>). The instruments on board HST permit for near continuous coverage over a broad wavelength range spanning ∼0.3-1.7 µm (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sing et al. 2016</ref>) split across three pass-bands. In addition, Spitzer provides complementary broadband photometry from 3.5 to 5.4 µm (and historically out to 8 µm). While the coverage is broad, the resolution is very course, typically R ∼30-200. HST observations in both emission and transmission generally permit order-of-magnitude constraints on the molecular abundance of water (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kreidberg et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Wakeford et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tsiaras et al. 2018</ref>). The low resolution and limited near-IR coverage, however, has precluded our ability, for most objects, to sufficiently break degeneracies to constrain (beyond upper limits) the abundances of other key diagnostic molecules like methane, carbondioxide, carbon-monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, acetylene. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), anticipated to launch within the next few years, will significantly improve precisions on the aforementioned quantities ( <ref type="bibr">Greene et al. 2016</ref>), due to the extremely broad, continuous (0.6-12 µm), low-to-moderate resolution spectroscopy (R ∼ 100-3,500). However, JWST is going to be a limited resource and it is therefore crucial to pair it with independent but complementary observations.</p><p>A powerful emerging approach for characterizing exoplanet atmospheres is high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS). It leverages the ability of resolving molecular bands into the individual lines and detecting the planet's Doppler shift directly at the ∼km s −1 level. In addition, it benefits from the large collective area of ground-based telescopes. Spectral information is extracted through cross-correlation with model templates, which acts as a robust signal filtering technique to recognize the peculiar fingerprint of each species. HRCCS is the best technique so far to unambiguously identify molecules, and it is the only technique to have reliably detected carbon-based molecules in the atmospheres of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets, starting with the pioneering detection of carbon monoxide by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Snellen et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this potential, little work has focused on rigorously determining the abundances of molecules, the vertical temperature structure, and other fundamental atmospheric properties from HRCCS data. One of the primary challenges in doing so is placing HRCCS within a robust atmospheric retrieval framework. Contrarily to LRS data, where spectra are either calibrated in flux or measured in comparison to a reference star, HRCCS data is "self-calibrated", meaning that the broad-band information and the time variations of flux at each wavelength are divided out of the data. With such normalization, the small variations due to the planet atmosphere are all measured relative to the stellar flux. This peculiarity, together with small residual broad-band structure due to imperfect normalization, results in the loss of a reliable continuum which inhibits the use of standard data-model comparisons via "chi-square fitting", as commonly done with LRS data. Cross-correlating with model spectra, besides providing a matching filter for robust identification of species, is also insensitive to any residual broad-band variations.</p><p>The challenge with retrieving atmospheric parameters from high-resolution spectra is converting the crosscorrelation values into a goodness-of-fit estimator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brogi et al. (2012)</ref> developed a statistical test to assess the significance of cross-correlation signals by comparing the distribution of cross-correlation values around the planet radial velocity (typically labeled as the "in-trail" sample) to the values away from it (the "out-of-trail" sample). This strategy has been widely adopted in the literature since then ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birkby et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Birkby et al. , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brogi et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brogi et al. , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Nugroho et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hawker et al. 2018</ref>). Due to the necessity to compute a statistically significant number of cross-correlation values (typically thousands of values mapping the planet's orbital and systemic velocity), its application is limited to the evaluation of a relatively small (∼ 100) number of models. Furthermore, this test is somewhat sensitive to the range around the planet radial velocity chosen for building the in-trail distribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2017)</ref> introduce a different method to overcome some of the above limitations. They estimate as accurately as possible the model crosscorrelation function and compare it to the observed cross-correlation function via chi-square fitting. To replicate as closely as possible astrophysical, instrumental, and data analysis effects, each model is added to the real data, albeit at a sufficiently low level so that the noise properties and data analysis are not altered. This alternative strategy still requires significant computational resources and is therefore limited to the evaluation of only a few thousands model HRCCS spectra sampled from a pre-existing LRS posterior. Such sparse sampling is only sufficient to constrain confidence intervals within the 3-σ level, and on a limited portion of the parameter space. As a consequence, full independent retrievals on HRCCS data cannot be performed. Conditioning the HRCCS retrieval on the LRS retrieval implicitly assumes that the two datasets contain the same amount of evidence (or weighting), which is not necessarily the case given the different spectral range and signal to noise of the observations. Lastly, since neighboring cross-correlation values can be correlated (depending on the sampling in velocity and the instrumental resolution), chi-square is not necessarily the correct statistic to compare cross-correlation functions.</p><p>The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a robust and unbiased framework to perform Bayesian retrieval analyses on HRCCS data, free from the limitations of previous approaches. In Section 2 we define a likelihood function for high-resolution spectra, and we describe its implementation into a nested sampling Bayesian estimator. In Section 3 we describe the setup used to test our new Bayesian framework, including a simulated dataset replicating previous work on dayside spectroscopy of HD 209 458 b. We present the analysis of the simulated dataset (Section 3.2), the excellent match between the retrieved and the modeled atmospheric parameters (Section 3.3), the effects of uncertainties in the line list of water vapor (Section 3.5) and the increased precision when combining space and ground observations (Section 3.6). We then apply the framework to real observations of two exoplanets, HD 189 733 b and HD 209 458 b, in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 by highlighting future applications of this framework, in particular coordinated observations with space and ground telescopes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A NOVEL HRCCS ATMOSPHERIC RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORK</head><p>At its core, an HRCCS retrieval is no different than the typical LRS retrievals applied in numerous previous works (see, e.g., review by Madhusudhan 2018).</p><p>The key components of any retrieval algorithm are the data or observable, the forward model which maps the quantities of interest onto the data/observable, and the Bayesian estimator that optimizes the forward model parameters (or range thereof) given a likelihood function <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The Forward Model</head><p>A typical spectral retrieval forward model is a radiative transfer routine that takes in gas abundances, cloud properties, vertical thermal structure information, and/or geometric information to produce a transmission or emission spectrum.

Illustration of the key components of the HRCCS retrieval algorithm. Many components are the same as in a classic "low-resolution" retrieval: the forward model, the data, and the Bayesian Estimator. The key novelties (indicated in blue) required to perform retrievals in crosscorrelation space are the inclusion of the radial velocities (system+orbital), a telluric subtracted "data-cube" of normalized spectrum vs. time/phase, and a mathematical mapping from correlation-coefficient to a likelihood function that can be used inside a parameter estimation package such as an MCMC <ref type="figure">(Figure modified</ref>  CHIMERA 1 forward model offers the flexibility to handle a variety of atmospheric assumptions from simple 1D non-self-consistent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. , 2014</ref>) to full 1D self-consistent thermo-chemical radiative-convective equilibrium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arcangeli et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kreidberg et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mansfield et al. 2018</ref>) to quasi 2D/3D parameterizations and observing geometries <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Feng et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Line &amp; Par- mentier 2016)</ref> as well as flexible treatments of opacities (e.g., line-by-line, line-sampling, and correlated-k) based upon a pre-tabulated line-by-line (&lt;0.01 cm −1 ) absorption cross section database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freedman et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Freedman et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Selection</head><p>Specifically, here, we explore the classic free and chemically-consistent versions described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kreidberg et al. (2015)</ref> but in the emission geometry. In the free forward model we include as free parameters the H 2 O and CO mixing ratios (constant with pressure), H 2 -H 2 /He collision induced absorption-CIA, and the 3-1 A version of the transmission spectrum code is publically avaialable through STScI's ExoCTK package: https://github.com/ExoCTK/chimera parameter 2 disk-integrated temperature-pressure profile (T -p profile) parameterization of Guillot (2010) 3 . In the chemically consistent forward model we utilize the same T -p profile parameterization but parameterize the composition with a metallicity ( <ref type="bibr">[M/H]</ref>, where solar is 0) and log-carbon-to-oxygen ratio (log(C/O), where solar is −0.26) under the assumption of pure thermochemical equilibrium computed using the NASA CEA2 routine <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gordon &amp; Mcbride 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kreidberg et al. 2015</ref>) by scaling the solar elemental abundances of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lodders et al. (2009)</ref>. In forward modeling used in this work we include as opacities H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , HCN, and H 2 -H 2 /He CIA, however for nearly solar abundances only H 2 O and CO present themselves over the K-band spectrum. The output from the forward model is a lineby-line top-of-atmosphere flux over the K-band (2.26-2.35 µm) which is then normalized to the stellar spectrum and planet-to-star area ratio.</p><p>The forward model spectra are then Doppler-shifted by spline interpolation based on the semi-amplitude of the planet radial velocity (K P ), the systemic velocity (V sys ), and the barycentric velocity of the observer V bary , according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V P (t) = V sys + V bary (t) + K P sin [2πϕ(t)] ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where we have neglected cross-terms in velocity due to their small impact (on the order of m s −1 ). The Dopplershifted model spectra are finally convolved with the appropriate instrumental profile. Due to the fact that velocities in Eq. 1 are not perfectly known, we introduce two additional key parameters: a differential systemic velocity (dV sys ) and a differential planet radial velocity (dK P ). With typical uncertainties of a few km s −1 , detectable at the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of HRCCS observations, neglecting these differential velocities would lead to incorrect localization of the planet's signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The Bayesian Estimator: Cross-Correlation to Log-Likelihood Mapping</head><p>Bayesian estimation necessarily requires a well defined likelihood function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gregory 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sivia &amp; Skilling 2006</ref>). The standard likelihood function in LRS analyses is a Gaussian, or equivalently a quadratic or chi-square log-likelihood. The challenge with HRCCS data is to exploit the power of the large number of spectral lines and relatively well known orbital velocity via the crosscorrelation between a template model and the phase dependent data. Once a mapping from the readily calculable cross-correlation coefficient to log-likelihood is found, one can employ the standard suite of Bayesian analysis tools including parameter estimation, prior inclusion, and model selection.</p><p>In building this HRCCS likelihood function, we want to exploit some unique characteristics of the analysis of high resolution spectra. Firstly, the continuum is divided out of the data to allow for their self-calibration (i.e. to eliminate the necessity for a reference star). Secondly, the planetary signal is extracted via crosscorrelation with model spectra, so our metric for the goodness of fit must incorporate the cross-correlation function or a closely related quantity. Thirdly, the sign of the correlation-coefficient matters, as it allows us to discriminate between emission lines incorrectly fitted with an absorption spectrum or vice-versa. Lastly, although the cross-correlation function is by definition normalized and thus insensitive to scaling of the model and/or the data, observations have a finite signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). This means that two nearly identical model spectra in terms of line-to-line ratios, but differing by orders of magnitude in the overall line strength should yield a different likelihood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Previous Cross-Correlation to Log-Likelihood</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mappings</head><p>The idea of mapping the correlation coefficient to a log-likelihood (hereafter CC-to-log L) is not new. One of the earlier applications of such a mapping in the exoplanet community was in the context of precise stellar radial velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zucker 2003)</ref>. The aim of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zucker (2003)</ref> was to derive a formalism that facilitated combining radial velocity measurements obtained via crosscorrelation from multiple spectral regions and at varying SNR. Starting from the definition of χ 2 , Zucker (2003) derived the following CC-to-log L mapping:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log(L) ∼ log(1 − C 2 ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The key feature of this mapping is that the log L depends on the square of correlation coefficient (C). For our application, the use of the square of the cross-correlation function limits the sensitivity to inversion layers. Although the actual line shape in day-side spectra can be quite complex and it is not a trivial "sign flip" when going from non-inverted to inverted (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz et al. 2015</ref>), spectra with emission lines cross correlated with absorption models (and vice-versa) produce some anticorrelation that would not be discriminated due to the insensitivity to the sign of C. In addition, the loglikelihood of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zucker (2003)</ref> weights the spectra based on their cross-correlation value, assuming therefore that each spectrum delivers a peak significantly above the level of the noise. Although this is appropriate for stellar radial velocities, it is not the case for planetary radial velocities, and we thus expect this likelihood to struggle at low SNR levels. This mapping should work well for high-signal to noise spectra of isolated objects like brown dwarfs and directly imaged planets, as demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bowler et al. (2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lockwood et al. (2014)</ref> were the first to apply a CC-tolog L mapping to high-resolution exoplanet spectroscopy of the non-transiting planet τ Boötis b. In their derivation they show that log(L) = C.</p><p>This same mapping was also recently adopted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Piskorz et al. (2018)</ref> to combine Keck NIRSPEC K-band data with Spitzer for the transiting hot-Jupiter Kelt-2 Ab.</p><p>There is cause for concern that this functional form is not optimal if we recall that log-likelihood is distributed as a chi-square <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wilks 1938)</ref>. While doubling the crosscorrelation will double the signal-to-noise of the detection, doubling the χ 2 does not double significance, because the mapping between chi-square and probability (e.g., p-value) is not linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gregory 2005)</ref>. This means that <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lockwood et al. (2014)</ref> CC-to-log L mapping is likely to underestimate the significance of a change in log-likelihood, which would result in substantially larger confidence intervals. We show indeed in Section 3.4 that this log L is not distributed as a χ 2 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>) and that the corresponding confidence intervals are not significantly constraining any of the measured atmospheric parameters ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">A New Mapping</head><p>In this Section we derive a new CC-to-log L mapping that leverages all of the aforementioned key components of a HRCCS observation. The starting point for building our mapping closely matches the derivation in section 2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Zucker (2003)</ref>. We denote with f (n) a single observed spectrum, where n is the bin number, or spectral channel.</p><p>We compute a template spectrum g(n) in the same reference frame as the data. We assume that the model describing the data is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (n) = a g(n − s) + d n ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where a is a scaling factor, s a bin/wavelength shift, and d n the noise at bin n.</p><p>It is important that f (n) and g(n) are continuum subtracted. In our current analysis, and following common implementation of numerical cross-correlation routines, we achieve this by subtracting the mean from each of the vectors prior to cross-correlation. Under these assumptions we have that n f (n) = 0 and n g(n) = 0. We assume that the noise is Gaussian distributed at each pixel with standard deviation σ. The Likelihood function L of our model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L = n 1 √ 2πσ 2 exp − [f (n) − a g(n − s)] 2 2σ 2 = = 1 √ 2πσ 2 N exp − n [f (n) − a g(n − s)] 2 2σ 2 , (5)</formula><p>where N is the total number of spectral channels. This is typically the number of pixels per spectrum (or per detector, or per spectral order). The log-likelihood can be derived from the above:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">log(L) = −N log σ − 1 2σ 2 n [f (n) − a g(n − s)] 2 , (6)</formula><p>after neglecting constant additive terms. We note that throughout this Section the function "log" will indicate the natural logarithm.</p><p>At this stage our analysis diverges from Zucker (2003). We impose that the scaling factor is unity (a = 1). Physically, this means that we want the overall strength of spectral lines in the model to match the observed data. Practically, since our data f (n) is normalized and telluric corrected, any residual variations is relative to the stellar continuum. We therefore scale g(n) as well to express it in units relative to the stellar continuum as mentioned in Section 2 and further explained in Section 3.</p><p>Eq. 6 contains another variable, σ. We do not fix this, as it is difficult to estimate the exact level of noise in each spectral channel, especially under imperfect removal of the telluric spectrum.

We start by describing the construction of the simulated dataset in Section 3.1 and its analysis in Section 3.2. We present the "fiducial" retrieved constraints in Section 3.3, compare the constraints derived from different CC-to-log L mappings in Section 3.4, explore the impact of different water linelists in Section 3.5, and finally combine in a coherent way the high-resolution spectra with a simulated Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) LRS dataset in Section 3.6.</p></div>

The synthetic data-set incorporates the photon noise from the star, variations in the Earth's transmission spectrum with airmass, variable detector efficiency, the phase dependent Doppler shift of the planet, and the time-dependent instrumental profile. This simulated dataset constitutes the basis to test the retrieval framework presented in the previous Sections, as it incorporates all the major sources of uncertainties in the analysis of HRCCS data.</p><p>To generate this dataset, we compute a solarcomposition planet atmosphere with parameters listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, and using the modeling tools described in Section 2.1. We run the computations over the wavelength range 2267-2350 nm (matching the CRIRES setup of the real observations) at a resolving power of R ∼ 440, 000 and scale the model to the stellar flux of HD 209 458 via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">F scaled (λ) = F B(λ, T eff ) R P R 2 (12)</formula><p>where F is the model flux in W m −2 m −1 , R P and R are the stellar and planet radii respectively, and B the Planck function at the stellar effective temperature T eff approximating the stellar spectrum ( <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The top panel (Step 1) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows a small portion of this spectrum in the wavelength range corresponding to detector 1 of CRIRES. We adopt a Keplerian circular velocity of of 145.9 km s −1 , i.e. the literature value for HD 209 458 b, and a combination of systemic and barycentric velocity to match the actual observations of night 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al.

The wavelength-and time-dependent transparency T (λ, t) of the Earth's atmosphere (the telluric spectrum) is computed via the ESO Skycalc command-line tool which is based on the Cerro Paranal Sky Model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Noll et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jones et al. 2013</ref>). The model takes into account the sky position of the target at the time of the observation and meteorological data, except for the precipitable water vapor (PWV) that needs to be adjusted manually. We find a good match to the HD 209 458 dataset by adopting the average PWV of 2.5 mm for Cerro Paranal.</p></div>

This synthetic dataset is then processed using the procedure outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Analysis of the simulated dataset</head><p>The analysis devised for processing data within this new dataset is largely adapted from previous literature, however there are some caveats related to the nature of our cross-correlation-to-likelihood mapping that require particular care. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, this analysis is labeled with Steps 4-7, which we detail below:</p><p>• Step 4: Each spectrum is calibrated in wavelength by comparing the pixel position of telluric lines in the observed spectra to their theoretical wavelength obtained from a telluric model. As in Flowers et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2018)</ref>, a common wavelength solution with constant space in velocity (constant dλ/λ) is computed and data are re-gridded to this solution via spline interpolation. Each spectrum is normalized by the median of its brightest 300 pixels to correct for throughput variations. Regridding is necessary for estimating the instrumental profile (IP) of CRIRES, which is done at this stage through the procedure described in Rucinski (1999) and implemented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brogi et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Flowers et al. (2018)</ref>. The IP is used to convolve the model spectra at a later stage.</p><p>• Step 5: The spectra are averaged in time and the mean spectrum is fitted to each observed spectrum with a second order polynomial. This procedure removes the main variability in the depth of methane telluric lines, however residuals are still visible at the position of water vapor telluric lines, which behave differently from methane due to the different scale height in the Earth's atmosphere and temporal changes in humidity.</p><p>• Step 6: These extra changes in water telluric lines are corrected by modeling the flux in each spectral channel as function of time with a second order polynomial, and dividing out the fit. Since the planet's orbital motion produces a time-varying Doppler shift of the spectrum, spectral lines from the exoplanet's atmosphere will shift across adjacent spectral channels and will be nearly unaffected by the above correction.</p><p>• Step 7: Any further alteration of the noise properties in the data must be avoided, because they would alter the data variance s 2 f in equation 9. Consequently, the common practice of weighting down noisy spectral channels by dividing them through their variance in time must be avoided. In this revised analysis, noisy columns above 3× the standard deviation of the matrix are masked and not used at the cross-correlation stage. The total number of channels N is modified accordingly for subsequent use in equation 9.</p><p>As in previous work, the above analysis exploits the fact that the planet spectrum is subject to a variable Doppler shift during a few hours of observations, whereas the contaminant signals (telluric and stellar) are stationary or quasi-stationary. However, we note that steps 5 and 6 are achieved with a variety of methods in the literature, either by fitting airmass dependence and then sampling time variations in common between spectral channels directly from the data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brogi et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brogi et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brogi et al. , 2016</ref>, or by applying blind detrending algorithms such as principal component analysis (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Piskorz et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">Piskorz et al. , 2017</ref>) or Sysrem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birkby et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Birkby et al. , 2017</ref>. All these approaches rely on the assumption that a certain spectral line from the exoplanet spectrum sweeps several spectral channels (several columns in our data matrix) during one night of observations, thus not influencing the detrending process significantly. This assumption is only true in first approximation. In reality, whatever algorithm is applied to the data, the planet signal is stretched and scaled in the process. We show an example of this alteration in the bottom panel (Step 7 noiseless) of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, which is the end point of the data analysis applied to a noiseless dataset. When compared to the initial spectrum at Step 2, the end result clearly shows artifacts and scaling effects due to telluric removal. If unaccounted for, these artifacts can bias the retrieved planet parameters (velocities, abundances, and thermal vertical structure).</p><p>As in previous work, the data at Step 7 is cross correlated with models, and each cross-correlation value is converted into log(L) value through Eq. 9. To account for the stretching of the planet signal, we repeat Steps 1-7 on each of the tested model spectra, but without adding the noise matrix N mod . This mimics the effects of the data analysis on the model, and eliminates the biases, at a small computational cost.</p><p>The standard approach at interpreting HRCCS observations would be to store the cross-correlation coefficients for each velocity, each spectrum, each detector and each night, and determine the "detection significance" of the planetary signal in the planetary-systemic velocity plane via the total cross-correlation coefficient summed over all observed orbital phases. This sum could be weighted to account for the different signalto-noise of each spectrum or variable telluric or planet signal of CRIRES detectors, introducing some sort of subjectivity to the process. The significance of the detection is then measured either by taking the ratio between the peak value of the total cross-correlation and the standard deviation of the cross-correlation coeffid <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Planetary signal detected in the "Kp-dVsys" plane. The x-axis is the differential system velocity (0 km/s represents no deviation from the known time-dependent system velocity) and the y-axis is the maximum radial (Keplerian) velocity of the planet. The figure is generated by summing the cross-correlation coefficient at all phases for each combination of Kp and dVsys and normalizing by the "noise" which is an average of the cross-correlation coefficients over a portion of velocity space far from the planetary signal. This noise/planetary parameter setup results in a ∼12σ detection of the planetary atmosphere at the "known" velocities (white dashed-lines).</p><p>cients around it, or by applying a more sophisticated ttest on the distributions of cross-correlation coefficients around and far from the planet radial velocity. If a high significance (usually larger than ∼ 4σ) is obtained at the expected velocity pair, then the planetary atmosphere is said to be detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Snellen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brogi et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">de Kok et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birkby et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Birkby et al. , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz et al. 2015</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the detection significance for the simulated planet signal (with the underlying CO and H 2 O abundances given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) which should aid in the qualitative mapping between standard methods and the constraints obtained through our retrieval method. Given our simulated planetary/stellar/noise properties, we would obtain a ∼12σ detection of the planetary signal in the planetary-systemic velocity plane at the input velocities. This fairly optimistic signal compared to the majority of past CRIRES detections is a combination of a model particularly rich in spectral lines, of the fact that we have neglected detector readout and thermal noise, additional photon noise from sky emission, and effects of damaged pixels and regions on the detector.</p><p>In this new framework, to obtain the total signal from the planet we just need to co-add all the log-likelihood values as function of time, detector, and/or night of ob-servation. Contrarily to previous studies, there is no need to weight cross-correlation functions anymore, because our likelihood contains the data and model variances (s 2 f and s 2 g , respectively), hence it intrinsically incorporates the variable SNR of the observations. This is another significant advancement of our framework and it adds objectivity to the retrieval process. In the following sections we perform a series of exploratory experiments with our novel HRCCS retrieval approach on this processed simulated data set. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> summarizes the retrieved properties on the simulated HRCCS data set. These constraints are quite remarkable-on the order of 0.5 dex for CO and H 2 O, despite the inclusion of realistic noise sources and common atmospheric retrieval parameterizations utilized in LRS data interpretations. It is encouraging to note that there is no bias in the retrieved parameters, including the scale factor, beyond what is expected due to the random noise-instantiation (N mod (λ, t) in equation 15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">A Simple HRCCS "Free" Retrieval Example</head><p>We notice some curious, but expected degeneracies. Firstly, the water and CO abundances are strongly correlated. Increasing the water abundance would require an increase in the CO abundance to maintain an acceptable log-likelihood. The reason for this degeneracy is that the retrieval tries to preserve the ratio between the CO and the water lines. Increasing both together, over some range, preserves this ratio. This suggests that the HRCCS data is highly sensitive to the abundance ratios. In fact, the precision on log(CO)-log(H 2 O), a good proxy for C/O, is ±0.18 dex, about a factor of two better than for absolute abundances. Another noteworthy, but unsurprising degeneracy is between the two velocities. This is simply a reproduction of the degeneracy between K P and V sys seen in the total cross-correlation signal/detection significance <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>) that is easily lifted by repeating observations at different phase range. At least in this example, there do not appear to be any degeneracies between the abundances and the velocities. Additional degeneracies appear amongst the 3 parameters describing the T -p profile (not shown) that reflect the retrievals desire to maintain the temperature gradient over the 1 bar to 10 mbar region of the atmosphere.</p><p>It is worth noting that the tightest constraint on the water abundance through HST WFC3 emission spectroscopy (1.1 -1.7 µm) is ±0.6 dex (WASP-43 b, <ref type="bibr">Krei- dberg et al. 2014b</ref>). The high-resolution data, in particular this narrow slice of K-band spectra from 2.29 -2.34 µm, shows potential to constrain not only the water abundance to a higher precision, but also the CO abundance unobtainable with WFC3 alone. Given these constraints, it is not unreasonable to ask if they are "realistic". Specifically, how do we know that our choice of cross-correlation to log-likelihood mapping is correct? Wilks' Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wilks 1938)</ref> suggests that the the distribution of delta-log-likelihoods (specifically, −2∆ log(L) differenced from the maximum log(L)) over a posterior probability distribution should follow a chisquare distribution with number of degrees of freedom equal to the number M of parameters-in this example, M = 8 free parameters <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. The left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 5</ref> shows the distribution of −2∆ log(L) drawn from the posterior probability distribution of our test case under the CC-to-log L mapping described in Section 2.2.2. The histogram of −2∆ log(L) correctly follows a χ 2 distribution with 8 degrees of freedom suggesting an appropriate mapping.</p><p>As an additional check, though not shown, we performed 100 independent HRCCS retrievals on 100 separate photon noise instances (N mod (λ, t), but under the same telluric and planetary model-F mod (λ, t)). From this experiment we found that the distribution of parameter means (due to random noise scatter) agreed with what was expected from the uncertainties derived on an individual retrievals. The success of these robustness tests should not be surprising as the log(L) given by equation 9 derives directly from inserting the relation between data and model in equation 6 and carrying out the algebraic passages without approximations. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares the constraints obtained under the three different mappings. The mappings derived through equation 9 in this work and equation 2 in Zucker (2003) provide comparable parameter constraints. Nevertheless the Zucker (2003) mapping results in a bias in the medians of the retrieved H 2 O and CO abundances. These differences arise because the two mappings respond differently to a particular noise instantiation due to the inclusion (or lack-there-of) of the s 2 f and s 2 g terms. As with our mapping, we find that the distribution of −2∆ log(L) derived from the Zucker (2003) mapping agrees well with a chi-square distribution of 8 degrees of freedom, as required by Wilks' theorem ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, left and middle panels). Lastly, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lockwood et al. (2014)</ref> mapping results in very broad, virtually nonexistent constraints on all of the parameters (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Piskorz et al. (2018)</ref>). This mapping does not appear to leverage all of the properties in the data that lead to a constraint. Furthermore, the distribution of −2∆ log(L) clearly does not follow a chi-square distribution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  5</ref>, right panel) suggesting that it is not an appropriate mapping. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>. Retrieved constraints from the simulated HDS data set. Constraints are summarized with a corner diagram for the abundances and velocities and the T -p profile spread reconstructed from the parametrization, as is common in the LRS retrieval literature (e.g. ). We also show the marginalized constraint on the retrieved scale factor, a, to show that we indeed recover the expected maximum likelihood estimator (ˆ a = 1 or logâlogˆlogâ = 0). The water abundance is constrained to ±0.3 dex, CO to ±0.43 dex, and the velocities to ±0.93 and ±0.26 km s −1 respectively. The difference between log(CO) and log(H2O), a proxy for the C-to-O ratio (not shown) is constrained to ±0.18 dex. The input values, or "truths" are indicated with the vertical light blue lines and box in the corner plot.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Impact of H 2 O Cross-Sections</head><p>Brogi et al. (2017) explored the potential impact of incomplete or incorrect line lists on the cross-correlation signal. That work concluded that these uncertainties were not important mainly because water vapor was not detected in the high-resolution spectra. Having tested simulated spectra with both CO and H 2 O in this work allows us to re-assess the importance of cross sections in a completely controlled environment, and we present in this Section the main results.</p><p>Our simulated spectral sequence is the same as in Section 3.3 and it uses H 2 O cross sections calculated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Freedman et al. (2014)</ref> based upon the <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Partridge &amp; Schwenke (1997)</ref> line-list. We run two separate retrievals on this spectral sequence. The former uses the same absorption cross sections and should therefore result in unbiased parameters. The latter uses absorption cross sections generated from HITEMP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rothman et al. 2010</ref>) via the HITRAN HAPI routine ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kochanov et al. 2016)</ref> and is based on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barber et al. (2006)</ref> line-list. These cross sections are computed at 0.003 cm −1 sampling resolution, 100 cm −1 Voight wing cut-off. They assume "air" broadening over a well sampled pressure and temperature grid ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Freedman et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freedman et al. 2008</ref>). While there are subtle differences in the line profile assumptions between the two sets of absorption cross-sections, the main impact on HRCCS is the variable line position arising from different choices of linelists. We note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shabram et al. (2011)</ref> explored the differences in these two line lists at low resolution and found a negligible difference. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the impact of the line-list/cross-section assumptions. By eye (top panel) it is easily seen that the two spectra do not perfectly overlay on each other at the resolutions attainable by CRIRES. The shifts are seemingly random, suggesting that these differences cannot be compensated by a single velocity offset. These inconsistencies, when combined over the entire CRIRES K-band, result in substantial biases in the retrieved parameter distributions, which are offset by many sigma from their true state ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). The constraints on the abundances are also much tighter when using the "incorrect" line-list.</p><p>It is important to note that if our simulated dataset was calculated with cross sections from <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rothman et al. (2010)</ref>, the results would have been opposite, i.e. the retrieval with <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Freedman et al. (2014)</ref> cross-sections would have been biased. This is an important point to make, because although there is no extensive testing in the literature regarding the choice of line lists at high spectral resolution, all the past H 2 O detections with CRIRES were achieved with the line lists from <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rothman et al. (2010)</ref>. When CO and H 2 O were detected simultaneously, measured radial velocities (K P and V sys ) were consistent between species, which suggests unbiased water determinations with this database.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Combined LRS and HRCCS</head><p>Once a statistically robust CC-to-log L mapping is achieved, one can trivially combine information from various datasets. One such potentially useful combination is that between low resolution spectroscopy with HST WFC3 and high resolution spectroscopy with VLT CRIRES or Keck NIRSPEC. In this Section, we combine simulated HST WFC3 data (loosely based upon the obtained by running our framework on the HST data alone (red curves), VLT data alone (blue curves) and on the combined dataset (magenta curves). The dashed curves (blue=CRIRES, red=WFC3) are the temperature Jacobians at the indicated wavelengths (on and off band/line). In general HST WFC3 probes a relatively deep and narrow region. In contrast, the high dynamic range in the CRIRES spectrum permits broad altitude coverage. Combining low-and high-resolution spectra leads to a substantial improvement in the precision of these measurements. typical emission observations-30ppm/channel at 0.035 µm bins) with the above CRIRES K-band data within the chemically-consistent modeling framework (whereby metallicity and C/O are retrieved under the assumption of equilibrium chemistry).</p><p>Trivially, to combine the inference from different sets of data we just sum their log-likelihoods:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">log(L tot ) = log(L HRS ) + log(L LRS ),<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where log(L HRS ) is given by Eq. 9 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">log(L LRS ) = − 1 2 χ 2<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 8</ref> shows the spectral regions covered by these simulated data, and is representative of observations that would have been already feasible 5 years ago. The bottom panels show the retrieved planet properties by running our framework on the two datasets separately (WFC3 only in red, CRIRES K-band in blue, and on their combination in magenta derived through the combined log-likelihood function in Eq. 16). The planet metallicity ( <ref type="bibr">[M/H]</ref>) is much better determined with the WFC3 observations (±0.23 dex) because of the stringent constraint on the water abundance. CRIRES observations alone result in an [M/H] constraint (±0.48 dex ) that is ∼ 2× larger than that obtained with WFC3. However, the situation is completely opposite for the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) constraint. Without a second species to compare, these simulated WFC3 observations can only provide an upper limit that rules out high C/O scenarios due to the existence of the strong water absorption feature. However, the precise relative abundances that can be obtained through CRIRES spectroscopy via the high sensitivity to the line-ratios (see e.g. Section 3.3), we can obtain a bounded constraint on the C/O (±0.07 dex). Due to this complementarity between the datasets, applying the joint retrieval framework on their combination leads to increased precision on both metallicity and C/O.</p><p>Since we are testing a dataset based on a planet without a thermal inversion, in terms of T -p profile the two dataset probe reasonably similar regions of the planet photosphere <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 4</ref>, bottom-right panel), with only the CO line cores absorbing at significantly lower pressures (up to 10 −4 bar). Nevertheless, the combined dataset allows us to precisely determine both the atmospheric lapse rate and the photospheric temperatures 4 . In the case of high-altitude thermal inversion layers (temperature increasing with altitude), we anticipate that the complementarity between low-and highresolution spectra would be even more evident, with the two constraining mostly the lower and the upper atmosphere, respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Reduction Process and Setup</head><p>We applied the framework described in Section 2 and Section 3 to real K-band dayside spectra of exoplanets obtained with CRIRES at the VLT. We re-analyze the half night of observations of HD 189 733 b published in de  and the two half nights of HD 209 458 b presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2017)</ref>, to which we point the reader for more information. Here we recall that these datasets were observed around the strong 2-0 ro-vibrational band of carbon monoxide at 2.3 µm, but also that they should contain additional opacity from water vapor. Although H 2 O was indeed detected in the same CRIRES range for other exoplanets observed in dayside ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brogi et al. , 2014</ref>), it was not detected for these two planets. In the case of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz et al. (2015)</ref>, only a tentative detection of CO was presented, whereas a more advanced weighting of the CRIRES detectors allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2017)</ref> to recover the signal of CO at a S/N = 5, but again no water. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hawker et al. (2018)</ref> have revisited the dataset with a different de-trending algorithm for telluric lines, and confirmed the detections of CO and H 2 O.</p><p>Since we have substantial literature to support the potential of these data, in this work we apply the most objective analysis process by matching Steps 4-7 described in Section 3.2 and visualised in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Contrarily to past work, this analysis does not require optimisation of de-trending parameters, and is therefore ideal to apply our framework to data as uniformly as possible.</p><p>There is only one extra step required in the analysis of HD 189 733 b data. With a spectral type of K1V, the parent star shows strong CO absorption lines in the CRIRES spectral range. These lines are not completely stationary in wavelength in the observer reference frame, because the barycentric velocity changes by about 0.5 km s −1 during the 5 hours of observations. This is due to the changing orbital and rotational radial velocity of the Earth compared to the center of mass of the solar system. Fortunately, we have devoted abundant work in the past to the correction of stellar CO lines from HD 189 733. In this context, we apply the state-ofthe-art three-dimensional modelling of the stellar photosphere described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Flowers et al. (2018)</ref>, and we divide out this modeled stellar spectrum between Step 4 and 5 of the analysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>, i.e. just before the removal of telluric lines. We note that this modeling is not parametric. Being completely self-consistent, our stellar 3D models only assume an initial metallicity for the star, which is well constrained in the literature and has been also verified by inspecting the shape and depth of stellar CO lines in the CRIRES data. Therefore, there is no subjectivity in the correction of the stellar spectrum, as no extra fitting or optimization is required at this stage.</p><p>One final caveat for the analysis of real spectra is that we do not have an accurate model for the temporal variations of the telluric spectrum, which is needed to replicate the stretching and scaling of planetary signals due to telluric removal. We thus store the fitted telluric absorption spectrum obtained through Steps 4-6 of the analysis and use it to process each of the tested models, following the same prescriptions as for the simulated dataset (Section 3.2).</p><p>The forward model used for both objects deviates slightly from that used in the simulated case <ref type="bibr">(Section 3.3</ref>) in that we add an optically thick gray cloud parameterized with a cloud-top-pressure (CTP, log(P c )) and explore an additional "simple" T -p profile parameterization similar to that described in . We also adjusted the prior upper bound on the irradiation temperature (T irr in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) for each object to prevent un-physically hot temperatures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">HD-189733b Retrieval Results</head><p>Figure 9 summarizes the HRCCS retrieval results within our framework. We find only an upper limit on the water abundance, significantly lower than expected for solar elemental ratios, and a lower limit on the CO abundance but consistent with solar expectations. The lower pressure limit on the CTP is consistent with a cloud-free day-side; however there is a notable degeneracy with the CO abundance whereby decreasing the CTP (higher altitude) results in an increase in CO abundance. This is simply understood as the competition between the muting of the line-to-continuum ratio by the cloud and increasing line-to-continuum ratio with increasing CO abundance. However, not including the cloud has little impact on the CO abundance. We also find that the abundances are largely insensitive to our choice of T -p profile parameterization, even if the retrieved T -p profiles themselves are different.</p><p>The planet velocities are shifted by a few km s −1 from their nominal values. We emphasize that it is important to marginalize over the velocities as uncertainties in orbital properties, especially years after their publication, can result in artificial velocity shifts. In fact even for well-known exoplanets such as HD 189 733 b, errors in the quantities defined in equation 1, in particular K P and ϕ, can lead to radial-velocity uncertainties of a few km s −1 , well above the sensitivity of these observations. A more subtle aspect is that many of the fundamental orbital parameters such as semi-major axis and orbital period can be correlated, hence using the reported error bars in the literature might lead to lower limits only on the final uncertainties.</p><p>In order to assess the uncertainties in planet velocities we compute the error bars on K P from the stellar radial velocity amplitude and planet/star mass ratio, and the error bars on the orbital phase ϕ from the time of midtransit and the orbital period, all in the hypothesis of circular orbits. In the case of HD 189 733 b, we obtain negligible errors in the orbital phase, but a ∆K P of about 6 km s −1 , which is sufficient to bring the retrieved K P within the 1-σ uncertainty.</p><p>The obvious finding from the retrieval of HD 189 733 b data is the strong detection of CO (lower abundance limit-4.67σ according to the nested-sampling derived Bayesian evidence ratio) and non-detection of water (upper abundance limit). While this is surprising from solar elemental ratios and thermochemical arguments, it is not in the context of previous analysis of this dataset. Using a completely independent analysis on the same 2.3µm data, de  report a detection of carbon monoxide at 5σ and no detection of water vapor. In contrast, the L-band data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birkby et al. (2013)</ref> show a clear detection of water vapor at 4.8σ. The spectra are taken with the same instrument (CRIRES), but at wavelengths with radically different water opacity. It is possible that a moderately low abundance of water vapor (e.g., VMR ∼ 10 −5 ) produces a water spectrum too weak to be detected at 2.3 µm but sufficiently strong to dominate the spectrum at 3.2 µm. Through transmission spectroscopy, water vapor is detected both at 2.3 µm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brogi et al. 2016</ref>) and over the entire NIR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brogi et al. 2018</ref>), though the abundance of H 2 O is unreported in those works.</p><p>Our retrieved T -p profile is qualitatively consistent with both de  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birkby et al. (2013)</ref> who both rule out a strong inversion due to the poor correlation with atmospheric models containing emission lines.</p><p>Finally, as motivated by our findings in Section 3.5, we again explored the impact of the line-list choice. Unsurprisingly, because there is a lack of detection of water, we found virtually no difference in the posterior probability distribution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 10</ref> summarizes the posterior probability distribution under the assumption of the default T -p-profile parameterization from Section 3.3. As with HD 189 733 b we again find only a sub-solar upper limit on the water abundance. However, we obtain a rather stringent constraint (±0.3 dex, resulting in a 7.44σ evidence based detection) on the CO abundance, of which is only marginally super-solar (0.5 dex higher, or just over 1σ). We again find a lower pressure limit on the CTP with a similar, albeit with a less pronounced degeneracy with CO.</p></div>

The light blue lines/box within the 1D/2D histograms indicate the approximate mixing ratios predicted by thermo-chemical equilibrium at solar abundance and the 0-offset velocities.

A reanalysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2017)</ref> found that the planet signal was very unequally distributed across the four detectors of CRIRES, and could recover CO absorption signal at SNR=5 by unequally weighting the data.</p><p>These data along with previously unpublished 3.2-µm data were recently analyzed by an independent team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hawker et al. 2018)</ref>. Although the conclusions on the K-band data confirm our findings of no water and strong CO, the L-band data reveals clear absorption from H 2 O and HCN. As in the case of HD 189 733 b, water is undetected at 2.3 µm but detected in L-band.</p><p>Contrarily to HD 189 733 b, though, the CRIRES transmission spectrum of HD 209 458 b at 2.3 µm does not show any water absorption lines. As this was the first successful detection published with HRCCS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>) and the analysis was optimized for CO lines, it is possible that the sensitivity of the data was not sufficient to detect H 2 O.</p><p>We again, explore the impact of the water line list, as with HD 189 733 b. In general we do not find that the histograms indicate the approximate mixing ratios predicted by thermo-chemical equilibrium at solar abundance and the 0-offset velocities. An upper limit on the water abundance is obtained under both line-list scenarios, but the CO abundance is fairly tightly constrained at values slightly higher than expected under solar composition, thermochemical equilibrium at these temperatures. choice of water opacity influences the the primary conclusions but it does change the shape of the marginalized water histogram towards a more concentrated solution near 1 ppm. however, there still exists a non-negligible tail extending to lower abundances, suggesting again, that this is still just an upper limit, consistent with a non-detection (according to the Bayesian evidence ratios).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Implications</head><p>It is worth briefly discussing how these results compare to LRS retrievals from emission spectroscopy with HST and Spitzer as both objects have been thoroughly investigated with these instruments. The day side emission spectrum of HD 189 733 b is by far the most complete in terms of wavelength coverage and "spectral density" composed of HST WFC3, NICMOS, Spitzer IRAC/MIPS/IR (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee et al. 2012</ref>, for a summary), though with questionable reliability of some of the datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gibson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hansen et al. 2014</ref>). Retrievals on this emission dataset have suggested water and CO abundances that are broadly consistent with solar thermochemical expectations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee et al. 2012</ref>). Our retrieved abundances for CO are rather consistent with those previous findings (e.g, ∼ 10 −5 − 10 −2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2014</ref>) but our retrieved water abundance upper limit (∼ 10 −4 , <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 9 top histogram)</ref> skirts the lower bounds of previous findings (see, e.g., <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2014</ref>). The most recent analysis of the fairly complete day-side emission spectrum of HD 209 458 b ( ) includes a strong water vapor absorption feature over the HST WFC3 bandpass suggestive of water mixing ratios no lower than 10 −5 , right near the upper limit of what we retrieve <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 10 top histogram)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brogi et al. (2017)</ref> investigated both the LRS ( ) and HRS datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Schwarz et al. 2015)</ref> and found that water abundances are largely inconsistent due to the fairly stringent lower bound from the LRS data and lack of water detection in the HRS data.</p><p>Both objects also have fairly precise HST/WFC3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Deming et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">McCullough et al. 2014</ref>) and HST/STIS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sing et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sing et al. , 2016</ref>) transmission spectra with multiple independent analyses suggesting water abundances that span a broad range from ∼ 10 −6 −10 −2 depending on the specific analysis and datasets used ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tsiaras et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Line &amp; Parmentier 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">MacDon- ald &amp; Madhusudhan 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Madhusudhan et al. 2014</ref>), but no constraints on CO due to the limited wavelength coverage.</p><p>The reason for the HRS-LRS water inconsistency is not immediately clear. Whereas one would be tempted to blame it on water line-list uncertainties, our tests reveal no impact of different line lists on the analysis of HD 189 733 b data, and only a marginal impact on the analysis of HD 209 458 b. One additional speculation relates to the different atmospheric pressure at which the core of H 2 O and CO lines are formed. As low-and high-altitude wind patterns can differ by many km s −1 in hot Jupiters, it is possible that CO and H 2 O lines track slightly different Doppler velocity. As water has the biggest dynamic range in terms of weak/strong lines, it is the most affected by vertical wind shears, to the point where the cross-correlation signal is smeared below detectability. Only a comparison with three-dimensional general circulation models as recently shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Flowers et al. (2018)</ref> will help us determining if atmospheric circulation has a detectable impact on the day-side spectra of hot Jupiters observed through HRCCS. In general it would not be surprising that the 3D nature of a planet can and will play a role in interpreting HRS data as these data are observed over a range of orbital phases with the potential for spatially variable temperatures, composition, clouds, and winds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This work demonstrates that an appropriate mapping of the cross-correlation coefficient to likelihood function allows us to coherently merge hi-resolution crosscorrelation spectroscopy with powerful atmospheric retrieval techniques. This approach opens up a new avenue in interpreting HRCCS data and fully exploits the information buried within it. Below we summarize our primary developments and findings:</p><p>• Developed (Section 2.2.2) a novel mapping from cross-correlation to log-likelihood and demonstrated that it is statistically appropriate permitting accurate parameter confidence intervals ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>• Formalized data analysis techniques, in particular the removal of telluric lines, and made them applicable to this new formalism without artificially scaling or biasing the planetary signal (Section 3.2).</p><p>• Explored the potential for this novel framework to constrain fundamental atmospheric properties like temperatures and abundances on a realistically simulated data-set ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, Section 3.3).</p><p>Despite being more degenerate than in LRS data, water abundance constraints are comparable to those obtained with HST WFC3. In addition, due to tight constraints on relative molecular abundances of CO and H 2 O, HRCCS + retrievals permit precise C-to-O ratio determinations.</p><p>• Provided a comprehensive comparison and discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of other correlation-coefficient to log-likelihood mappings (Section 2.2.1, 3.4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>, Figures 5 and 6)</head><p>• Determined the significance of the impact that water opacities can have on the results. Precise knowledge of exo-atmosphere relevant opacities are required at hi-resolution for these approaches to work.</p><p>• Applied the framework to existing day-side observations of the transiting hot Jupiters HD 189 733 b and HD 209 458 b, obtained with CRIRES at the Very Large Telescope. In spite of a clear signature of CO absorption, H 2 O is not clearly detected, regardless of the line list used, T -p profiles implemented, or assumptions on the presence of a thick cloud deck. We also rule our confidently the presence of inversion layers in the atmospheres of these two planets.</p><p>Currently there is a shortage of observations of transiting exoplanets with both HST/WFC3 and highresolution spectrographs from the ground. The main reason for this is that CRIRES and NIRSPEC, the two most active instruments to provide HRCCS observations in the past 5-10 years, have relatively poor throughput and spectral range. They are thus limited to observe the brightest exoplanets in the sky, which are mostly non-transiting. However, modern spectrographs have drastically superior simultaneous spectral range and equal or better throughput. This increase in sensitivity can be used to move HRCCS observations to smaller telescope facilities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brogi et al. 2018)</ref>, to enable observations of fainter planets, or both in case of the most performing instruments such as CARMENES or SPIRou. This technological evolution timely matches the future availability of JWST observations, which will also have increased sensitivity, spectral range, and in some cases spectral resolution. It is also well timed with the recent launch of the TESS satellite, which will find a significant fraction of exoplanets orbiting bright-enough stars to be followed up for atmospheric characterization. Lastly, the age of the next-generation of large telescopes is just a few years ahead. With construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope already ongoing, and first-light high-resolution instrumentation approved for both telescopes, it is crucial to develop techniques to pair the most exquisite JWST observations to the enormous collective power of the GMT and ELT telescopes. This paper set the foundation for rigorous analysis of HRCCS datasets and their coherent combination with LRS data. Future work will focus on three main directions:</p><p>• Implementing the retrieval on transmission spectroscopy data and jointly analyze all the currently available LRS and HRCCS datasets of HD 189 733 b and HD 209 458 b as well as other planets.</p><p>• Implementing in the algorithm other telluric removal algorithms such as PCA and Sysrem, which seem to perform excellently at wavelengths affected by strong telluric bands. Currently, the main restriction at implementing these algorithm is purely computational, as the framework forces us to repeat on each tested model spectrum the same exact analysis as on the real data, which comes at a significant computational cost for PCA/Sysrem algorithms.</p><p>• Exploiting the strong predictive power of the framework, in particular for simulating future joint JWST and ELT/GMT/TMT observations of temperate terrestrial worlds. These simulations will identify the optimal wavelength range, spectral resolution, and exposure times to maximize the science return from top-class space and ground-based observatories.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.
