				<p>Turbulent vertical transport driven by double-diffusive shear instabilities is identified as likely important in hot exoplanet atmospheres. In hot Jupiter atmospheres, the resulting vertical mixing appears sufficient to alleviate the nightside cold trap, thus facilitating the maintenance of nocturnal clouds on these planets. The strong level of vertical mixing expected near hot Jupiter thermal photospheres will impact their atmospheric chemistry and even their vertical structures where cloud radiative feedback proves important.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Observational campaigns with the radial velocity and transit detection methods have led to the discovery of a vast and diverse population of hot exoplanets. Chief among them, hot Jupiters are the best characterized type of exoplanets. Hot Jupiters have become de-facto testing grounds for many efforts to interpret atmospheric data from exoplanets, using measurements of secondary eclipses, phase curves and transmission spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Charbonneau &amp; Deming 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Seager &amp; Deming 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baraffe et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Madhusudhan et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Hot Jupiter atmospheres have revealed or hinted at the existence of many of the phenomena known to occur in the atmospheres of solar system planets, such as radiatively driven circulation, atmospheric chemistry, condensation and clouds. However, hot Jupiters are also expected to exhibit new phenomena in relation to their unique physical properties as hot and tidally-locked gas giants. For example, supersonic winds may prevail in these strongly-forced atmospheres even in the presence of dissipation through shocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Li &amp; Goodman 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fromang et al. 2016</ref>). Furthermore, magnetic drag and associated ohmic dissipation likely operate and are often invoked to explain the radius inflation exhibited by many hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batygin &amp; Stevenson 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Perna et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Menou 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Thorngren &amp; Fortney 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this letter, we introduce a new physical process that may prove important to address the hot Jupiter phenomenology: enhanced turbulent vertical transport from double-diffusive shear instabilities. This class of instabilities, which has its origins in the stellar astrophysics literature, requires a hot and opaque gaseous medium to operate. To the best of our knowledge, it is not thought to operate in colder Solar System atmospheres, which makes this process specifically relevant to hot exoplanets. While the instability has been discussed briefly before by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li &amp; Goodman (2010)</ref> in the context of local idealized fluid simulations, we adopt here a more global view and suggest that it could be key in establishing strong vertical mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres and other hot exoplanet atmospheres, by extension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DOUBLE-DIFFUSIVE SHEAR INSTABILITY</head><p>Instabilities in an atmospheric flow can be driven by vertical shear S ≡ ∂V H /∂z where V H is the horizontal velocity in the rotating frame of the planet and z is the vertical coordinate. Often, this type of instability is inhibited by a strongly stabilizing stratification, whose magnitude is measured by the Brunt-Vaissala frequency N:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N 2 = g γ d dz ln P ρ γ → γ − 1 γ g H p<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where H p = R T/g is the pressure scale height, the gas is assumed to behave ideally and γ is the adiabatic index. It is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chandrasekhar 1961</ref>) that adiabatic perturbations are stable if the Richardson number of the shear flow</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ri ≡ N 2 S 2 ≥ 1 4 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>As we shall see below, hot Jupiter atmospheres are typically expected to satisfy this adiabatic stability criterion and thus be Richardson-stable.</p><p>In the presence of thermal diffusivity, however, the stable vertical stratification can be effectively weakened to the point that small scale unstable modes can grow. The destabilizing role of thermal diffusivity is well known in the context of stellar astrophysics (e.g. leading to the so-called GSF instability for unstable rotation profiles <ref type="bibr">Goldreich &amp; Schu- bert 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fricke 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Menou et al. 2004</ref>). 1 Radiative diffusion from an ample bath of photons in an opaque hot gas is the key factor facilitating this class of (double-)diffusive instabilities in the stellar context. The same logic applies to hot exoplanet atmospheres, as we shall illustrate with hot Jupiters below. By contrast, cool atmospheres such as those of Solar System planets will not be affected by the diffusive shear instabilities of interest here and should typically be Richardson-stable.</p><p>In the presence of strong enough (radiative) thermal diffusivity</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ξ ≡ 16 3 γ − 1 γ σT 4 κ ρp<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and weak enough kinematic viscosity ν of the opaque atmospheric gas, the secular Richardson criterion becomes relevant so that the criterion for double-diffusive instability (Zahn 1992; Piro 2015):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ri s ≡ ν ξ Re c N 2 S 2 &lt; 1 4 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Re c 1000 is the critical Reynolds number for turbulence, likely applies. Hot exoplanet atmospheres, in particular hot Jupiters, are such that their opaque regions with large ξ and small ν values can become subject to doublediffusive shear instabilities. In the presence of such instabilities, turbulent vertical transport is expected to occur with a strength captured by the effective viscosity</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ν eff S N ξ<label>(5)</label></formula><p>with a limiting strength set by ξ/N H 2 p (to guarantee unstable wave-modes smaller than one atmospheric scale height). As long as the gas kinematic viscosity ν ξ, it has no direct effect on the magnitude of the turbulent transport in this formulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SCALINGS FOR HOT EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES</head><p>Let us now consider the range of unstable regimes and turbulent viscosities that can be expected over the vast parameter space of hot exoplanet atmospheres. For concreteness, we fix the atmospheric surface gravity and opacity coefficient to reference values g 0 and κ 0 respectively. Gas is assumed to behave ideally. We write the gas kinematic viscosity ν λc s , where λ is the gas mean free path with a fixed collisional cross-section (assumed ∼ 3 × 10 −16 cm 2 as for H gas, for simplicity) and</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">c s = √ RT (6)</formula><p>is the (isothermal) sound speed.</p><p>1 We find that hot Jupiter atmospheric flows are likely rotationally stable (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li &amp; Goodman 2010)</ref> Under these conditions, we derive the leading-order scalings of ν, ξ, N and S in terms of atmospheric pressure, P, and temperature, T, for given values of g 0 and κ 0 . We find</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">ν ∝ T 3/2 P , (7) ξ ∝ T 5 κ 0 P ,<label>(8)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">N ∝ g 0 T 1/2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">S ∝ g 0 T .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>As a result, the secular Richardson number and turbulent viscosity obey to leading-order</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ri s ∝ κ 0 P T 5/2 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">ν eff ∝ T 9/2 κ 0 P 2 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>with no explicit dependence on g 0 . These idealized scalings show that an unstable atmosphere is more vigorously stirred by diffusive shear instabilities at shallower depths (low P) and higher temperatures.</p><p>It is useful at this point to evaluate the degree of stability of a prototypical atmosphere, that of the hot Jupiter HD209458b. We adopt the following representative values to ground our discussion: T = 1500K, P = 1bar, N/S 5 and Ri s 10 −4 N 2 /S 2 , with g = 25m s −2 and H p = 10 6 m. Our estimate of the shear rate S is based on a velocity differential of 1800m s −1 spread over two pressure scale heights, as inferred from the core equatorial jet in a typical simulated zonal wind profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012)</ref>. Note that these values correspond to Ri = 25 so that the atmosphere is indeed Richardson-stable despite the presence of strong vertical shear.</p><p>Once the role of diffusion is accounted for, however, we find ample room for double-diffusive instability, with Ri s 2 × 10 −3 1/4. The turbulent viscosity coefficient evaluates to ν eff 10 9 P −2 bar cm 2 s − 1, which is comparable to or greater than other values reported in the literature for K zz above the 1 bar pressure level (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Parmentier et al. 2013</ref>). The turbulent vertical transport becomes unrealistically strong as one approaches the IR photosphere according to this idealized prescription (with K zz ∼ 10 13 cm 2 s −1 at 10 mbar) and it is likely limited before that happens (see simulation results below). The transport is also expected to suddenly cut off above the photosphere as heat transport ceases to operate in the radiative diffusion approximation (our working assumption in writing Eq. 3 for ξ) and photons rapidly become free to stream out to space in the opticallythin component of the atmosphere.</p><p>Combining the specific results for HD209458b with the scalings across the hot exoplanet parameter space above, we infer that diffusive shear instabilities may be operating over a vast parameter space for hot exoplanets, down to warm effective temperatures perhaps as low as 500K. The magnitude of the resulting transport is strongly dependent on atmospheric temperatures, however, so that the strongest effects would typically be expected on the hottest planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODEL FOR HD209458B</head><p>Having established the relevance of double-diffusive shear instabilities for hot exoplanet atmospheres, we move on to an illustration of their consequences through the lens of a numerical simulation for a specific hot Jupiter, HD209458b. One of the key motivations for this numerical exercise is that shear instabilities are sensitive to details of the atmospheric flow dynamics. In addition, a strong enough turbulent vertical transport can feedback on the circulation pattern (i.e., reduce the shear) in such a way that the instability operates at a reduced level or even at a marginal level only. Performing a fully-coupled atmospheric flow simulation with a prescription for turbulent vertical transport that is dynamically-adjusted is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we settle for the next best approach, which is the specification of a static, dynamically-imposed vertical transport profile, from which we can run diagnostics on the level of turbulent vertical transport expected in a more realistic fully-dynamic simulation.</p><p>We have established above that a reasonable profile of turbulent vertical diffusion for HD209458b is :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">K zz 10 9 P 1 bar −2 cm 2 s −1 .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>We impose this profile for the mixing of momentum and entropy in an HD209458b simulation using the built-in vertical transport scheme in our meteorological solver IGCM3 (Rauscher &amp; Menou 2012), which solves turbulent vertical transport of a quantity (Q) as a diffusion problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∂Q ∂t = σ H 2 p ∂ ∂σ σK zz ∂Q ∂σ<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where σ = P/P bot is the pressure coordinate (scaled to the bottom pressure P bot ) and K zz is the diffusion coefficient for quantity Q. Zero flux boundary conditions are imposed. Viscous heating is not returned to the flow in this implementation, while it could prove important where friction is strong.</p><p>Our simulation setup is in most ways similar to that in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Rauscher &amp; Menou (2012)</ref>, with the following exceptions. Our model is truncated at the 10 mbar pressure level, which approximately corresponds to the thermal photosphere for this model, with a resolution of T21L30 (64x16 with 30 vertical levels). Broadly consistent results are obtained at a lower resolution of T10L20 (32x8 with 20 vertical levels). The model is integrated forward in time for 100 planet rotation periods, rather than 2000, as dictated by computational limitations due to the small time-steps we must adopt in the presence of the strong vertical transport imposed (∆t must be reduced by a factor of 50 for numerical stability). Nevertheless, this run time is sufficient to establish a steady wind pattern in the simulation domain (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1 below)</ref>, with the exception of the deepest atmospheric levels (below 1 bar), which require much more time for spin-up but are largely irrelevant to our discussion of vertical transport above the 1 bar level. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the zonally-averaged zonal wind profile in (a) our simulation with dynamically-imposed turbulent vertical transport according to Equation 13 and (b) a reference simulation with the vertical transport turned off. The wind pattern that emerges is largely consistent with previously published wind profiles. This establishes that while turbulent momentum transport acts to reduce vertical shear in this simulation, it does not do so strongly enough to overcome the wind shear continuously established by differential radiative forcing. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Differences between panels (a) and (b) are noticeable, however. Wind speeds are somewhat reduced and vertically homogenized in the presence of strong vertical transport, especially in the 10-100 mbar region.</p><p>Taking the atmospheric patterns in these simulations at face value, we can run a variety of diagnostics on the atmospheric flow. In particular, we can directly compute  values for the shear rate, the Brunt-Vaissala frequency, the Richardson number and the thermal diffusivity coefficient everywhere in the atmospheric flow. 3 . The range of values we observe in the simulation with dynamically-imposed vertical transport are compiled in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and 2</ref> for conciseness. We can also evaluate the secular Richardson number, Ri s , and the expected strength of turbulent vertical transport in the form of a diagnostic K zz value. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows detailed maps of local K zz values computed on the 40 (panel a) and 860 (b) mbar surface levels in the simulation with dynamically-imposed vertical transport. K zz values vary by orders of magnitude on a given pressure level with a pattern that follows the temperature field, leading to distinct dayside and nightside vertical transport regimes high in the atmosphere. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows vertical profiles of horizontally-averaged K zz values in the simulations with (panel a) and without (b) dynamically-imposed vertical transport. In each panel, the solid blue line shows the K zz profile directly computed from the simulation, once averaged over each pressure level. The red and blue dashed lines show day-only and night-only averages. The dash-dotted orange line shows the dynamicallyimposed vertical profile imposed in the simulation (∝ P −2 ) with vertical transport. The green dotted line shows the profile (∝ P −1/2 ) advocated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Parmentier et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>The good agreement between the profile of K zz shown as an orange dash-dotted line (following Eq. 13) and the profile calculated from the reference simulation without imposed transport (solid blue line in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref>) establishes that Eq. 13 is a good zeroth-order approximation for K zz values in the atmosphere of HD209458b. On the other hand, the flattening of the K zz profiles computed from the simulated flow with dynamically-imposed vertical transport (solid and dashed lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a)</ref> shows that strong vertical transport of momentum in the upper simulated atmosphere can act to reduce the wind shear present, enough so that the resulting computed K zz profiles are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than Eq. 13 would suggest. This is a manifestation of the self-limiting nature of shear instabilities, where in the present case shear is continuously driven by differential radiative forcing and suppressed by the turbulent vertical transport that results. Since the diagnostic K zz profiles in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref> are found to be weaker than the strong dynamically-imposed vertical transport (orange dash-dotted line), they probably can be safely used as lowerlimits for the magnitude of transport that one would obtain from self-consistent simulations (with a transport magnitude continuously adjusted to what the atmospheric flow dictates). We also note that the diagnostic K zz profiles shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref> do not violate the limiting strength K zz SH 2 p , which is ∼ 10 12 -10 13 cm 2 s −1 for the simulated flow. <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> establishes that turbulent vertical transport driven by double-diffusive shear instabilities is strong and dominates over other sources of vertical mixing previously advocated for hot Jupiter atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Parmentier et al. 2013</ref>) above approximately the 1 bar level. The strongest turbulent vertical transport occurs on the dayside but even the planet's nightside is the site of vigorous mixing above the 1 bar level, up to the thermal photosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The magnitude of vertical transport and mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres influences the disequilibrium chemistry of molecular species (e.g. Zhang &amp; Showman 2018) and de- <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.

(2009)</ref> have estimated that values of K zz 10 11 cm 2 s −1 are needed to maintain particles of size 10µm aloft on the dayside of hot Jupiters. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Par- mentier et al. (2013)</ref> have estimated that values of K zz 1.5 × 10 10 cm 2 s −1 are required to maintain particles of size 10µm aloft across the nightside of hot Jupiters. The criteria are both met by the day-and night-averaged profiles shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a (red and violet dashed lines, respectively)</ref>. This suggests that diffusive shear instabilities offer a promising solution to the strong vertical mixing problem that has plagued hot Jupiter atmospheric and cloud models.</p><p>Stronger mixing favors the maintenance of massive cloud decks and larger particle sizes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Powell et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that, while the nightsides of hot Jupiters exhibit reduced vertical mixing relative to their daysides, nightside mixing is still vigorous enough to facilitate the maintenance of substantial nocturnal clouds, at least on planets like HD209458b. Assuming this property carries over to other hot Jupiters, it could provide a key ingredient to explain recent results pointing to prevalent nightside clouds in the hot Jupiter population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beatty et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Keating &amp; Cowan 2018)</ref>.</p><p>While encouraging, it is also clear that our results on the role of double-diffusive shear instabilities remain of an exploratory nature. At a more fundamental fluid level, we would like to understand how double-diffusive shear instabilities develop, saturate and effectively transport both passive (condensates) and active (momentum) flow attributes in a hot exoplanet atmosphere. In particular, momentum may be transported differently than passive tracers. These instabilities also abruptly cease to operate at/above the thermal photosphere, an aspect that deserves particular attention if one is interested in the observational signatures of hot Jupiters.</p><p>One would also like to gain a broader understanding of the range of applicability of these instabilities, from warm mini-Neptunes to the hottest hot Jupiters. This may require a fairly extensive and numerically expensive survey of global circulation models of the type presented here for HD209458b. On the hottest planets, turbulent vertical transport could compete with magnetic drag to reduce wind speeds at/below thermal photospheric levels. On the coolest planets where the process still operates, it might be restricted to their daysides, with much reduced mixing on the nightsides.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
