			<abstract>
				<p>Recent observations revealed a bimodal radius distribution of small, short-period ex-oplanets with a paucity in their occurrence, a radius &apos;valley&apos;, around 1.5 − 2.0 R ⊕. In this work, we investigate the effect of a planet&apos;s own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric mass-loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences for the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplan-ets. Using simple analytical descriptions and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that planetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e., without any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius distribution. Our results match the valley&apos;s location, shape and slope in planet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find that the slope of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss timescale at the Bondi radius and given by d logR p /d logP 1/(3(1 − β))) −0.11, where M c ∝ R β c is the mass-radius relation of the core. β 4 yields good agreement with observations, attesting to the significance of internal compression for planetary cores more massive than Earth. We further find that the location of the valley scales with the uncompressed core density as ρ −4/9 c * and that the observed planet population must have predominantly rocky cores with typical water-ice fractions of less than ∼ 20%. Furthermore, we show that the relative magnitude of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the details of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is not.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>NASA's Kepler mission has unveiled a wealth of new planetary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>). These systems offer new insights into the process of planet formation and evolution. One of Kepler 's key findings is that, to date, the most common planets in our galaxy are between 1 and 4 R ⊕ , i.e., larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Petigura et al. 2013</ref>). Further observations revealed a transition in average densities at planet sizes ∼ 1.5 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rogers 2015)</ref>, with smaller planets having densities consistent with rocky compositions while larger planets having lower densities indicating significant H/He envelopes. Since then, refined measurements have provided E-mail: akashgpt@ucla.edu strong observational evidence for the sparseness of shortperiod planets in the size range of ∼ 1.5 − 2.0 R ⊕ relative to the smaller and larger planets, yielding a valley in the small exoplanet radius distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fulton et al. 2017;</ref>. For example, the California-Kepler Survey reported measurements from a large sample of 2025 planets, detecting a factor of ∼ 2 deficit in the relative occurrence of planets with sizes ∼ 1.5 − 2.0 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fulton et al. 2017</ref>). Studies suggest that this valley likely marks the transition from the smaller rocky planets: 'superEarths', to planets with significant H/He envelopes typically containing a few percent of the planet's total mass: 'subNeptunes' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rogers 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>). Furthermore, the location of this valley is observed to decrease to smaller planet radii with increasing orbital period.</p><p>In a recent study involving asteroseismology-based high precision stellar parameter measurements for a sample of 117 planets, a slope d logR p /d logP = −0.09 +0.02 −0.04 was reported for the radius valley <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Van Eylen et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>The observed valley in the exoplanet radius distribution has been attributed to photoevaporation of H/He atmospheres by high energy stellar radiation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013)</ref>. Recent work showed that thermal evolution models with photoevaporation can reproduce the observed radius distribution (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Owen &amp; Wu 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Van Eylen et al. 2018</ref>).</p><p>However, photoevaporation by high energy photons is not the only proposed mechanism for shaping the radius valley. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. (2018)</ref> demonstrated that the corepowered mass-loss mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>) can produce the exoplanet radius distribution, even without photoevaporation, solely as a by-product of the planet formation process itself. In the core-powered mass-loss mechanism, the luminosity of the cooling planetary core provides the energy for atmospheric loss. In this paper, we extend the results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. (2018)</ref> and show that the corepowered mass-loss mechanism can produce the valley's location, shape and slope in planet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We further use it to constrain the planet's core composition and the mass-radius relation of the core.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 is divided into several parts. In the first, we describe our planetary model, its structure and relevant equations. We then outline the core-powered mass-loss mechanism and define the parameters of the exoplanet population used in our numerical evolution calculations. We discuss our results in Section 3, which includes a comparison with observations and investigations into how our results depend on the physical parameters of the planet population. Our conclusions are summarized in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PLANET STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION</head><p>In this section, we describe our model for the structure of the core and envelope of close-in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes and their evolution due to core-powered mass-loss after the dispersal of the gas disk. For a detailed review of this mechanism, the reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. (2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Planet Structure</head><p>We assume a planet of radius R p and mass M p with a dense core surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere, with most its mass in the core such that M c ∼ M p . We note here that by core we mean the non-gaseous part of the planet and such that this includes both the iron core and silicate mantle of an Earth analog. We assume, accounting for gravitational compression, that the mass-radius relationship for the core is given by <ref type="bibr">4/3</ref> , where ρ c * is the uncompressed density, R c is the radius of the core and ⊕ refers to the corresponding Earth values ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Valencia et al. 2006</ref>). For pure water/ice, silicate and iron cores, we assume ρ c * to be 1.3 g cm −3 , 4 g cm −3 and 11 g cm −3 , respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M c /M ⊕ = (R c /R ⊕ ) 4 (ρ c * /ρ ⊕ )</formula><p>We assume that all cores are initially surrounded by H/He envelopes of mass M atm and define the atmosphere to core mass fraction as f = M atm /M c . Motivated by previous work on gas accretion and loss during disk dispersal ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>), we use</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f 0.05(M c /M ⊕ ) 1/2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>as our initial condition for the atmospheric masses of the planets in our model. As has been shown in previous works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref>, the structure of the atmosphere is, to first order, well described by an inner convective region that contains most of the atmospheric mass and an outer radiative, nearlyisothermal, region of negligible mass. The transition between these two regions occurs at the radiative-convective boundary which we denote as R r cb . We treat the R r cb as the planet's effective radius, i.e., R p R r cb . This is a good approximation as the density profile changes sharply at the R r cb . We model the atmosphere as an ideal gas.</p><p>The dispersal of the protoplanetary disk causes a loss of pressure support on the outer edge of the envelope, causing atmospheric mass-loss powered by the luminosity of the cooling inner regions of the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Owen &amp; Wu 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016)</ref>. As a result, the envelopes of close-in planets rapidly shrink (roughly on the timescale on which the disk disperses) to thicknesses ∆R R c , where ∆R = R r cb − R c is the thickness of the envelope measured from the core's surface. Since we are interested in the evolution of the planets after disk dispersal, we assume ∆R R c as initial condition for the thickness of the planetary envelopes (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Owen &amp; Wu 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The atmospheric mass can be obtained by integrating the density profile over the convective region, which yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M atm = γ − 1 γ 4πR 2 c ρ r cb ∆R R B ∆R R 2 c 1/(γ−1) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where γ is the adiabatic index of the atmosphere, ρ r cb is the density of the atmosphere at R r cb and R B is the modified Bondi radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016)</ref>, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R B ≡ γ − 1 γ GM c µ k B T r cb (3)</formula><p>where µ is the molecular mass of the atmosphere, k B is Boltzmann constant, G is the gravitational constant and T r cb ∼ T eq is the temperature at the R r cb , and T eq the equilibrium temperature for a given distance from the host star.

We ignore the ultra-thin regime, ∆R/R c R c /R B ∼ 0.1, for which T c ∼ T eq as this regime cannot yet be detected in the exoplanet radius distribution. We also ignore any additional heat generated by radioactive decay in the core. Including this would delay the transition to the ultra-thin regime further, and it may lead to additional atmospheric mass-loss for planets whose loss is not limited by the cooling time or age of the system.</p><p>We model the core, to first order, as incompressible,  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

As shown, the convective region of the atmosphere extends from the core to the radiative-convective boundary, R r c b , which is comparable to a few core radii, R c , at the end of the disk dispersal phase (our initial condition), and the radiative region extends from the R r c b to the Bondi radius, R B .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Evolution Model</head><p>We start our evolution models right after the disk dispersal phase. To distinguish our results from any atmospheric mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we only consider the planet's evolution due to its own cooling luminosity and its subsequent mass-loss.</p><p>As shown above, the core temperatures are, a result from formation, of the order of 10 4 − 10 5 K. Since the core-envelope interface is well coupled, the cooling of both the core and envelope is dictated by diffusion through the radiative-convective boundary. This implies that the planet cools at a rate</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L = − dE cool dt = 64π 3 σT 4 r cb R B κ ρ r cb ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and κ is the opacity at the R r cb . Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(6)</ref> can be combined to yield a cooling timescale of the envelope, t cool , given by <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2008)</ref>, we model the opacity at the R r cb as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">t cool = |E cool /(dE cool /dt)| = E cool /L. Following Freedman et al.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">κ/0.1 cm 2 g −1 = (ρ r cb /10 −3 g cm −3 ) 0.6 .</formula><p>The energy required to lose the entire atmosphere is E loss gM atm R c . Comparing this with the energy available for cooling given in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref> yields that E cool</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E loss for M atm /M c &gt; µ/µ c ∼ 5% (heavy atmospheres) and E cool E loss for M atm /M c &lt; µ/µ c ∼ 5% (light atmo- spheres).</formula><p>Note, we ignored the γ and γ c factors here for simplicity. This implies that, depending on the atmosphere to core mass-ratio after disk dispersal, planets can continue to evolve in two different ways. Planets with heavy atmospheres (M atm /M c &gt; µ/µ c ) don't have enough energy to continually lose mass and their envelopes will cool and contract over time. In contrast, planets with light envelopes (M atm /M c &lt; µ/µ c ) can, from an energy point of view, continue to lose mass over time. Furthermore, since for light envelopes E cool E loss and since mass-loss proceeds at almost constant ∆R while decreasing the envelope density, atmospheric loss is a run-away process in the sense that energetically it gets easier with time (i.e., once the first half has been lost, it is even easier to loose the next half), ensuring that there is enough energy to lose the entire envelope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. , 2018</ref>.</p><p>However, despite sufficient energy, planets with light atmospheres are not necessarily stripped of their envelopes because, analogous to a Parker type wind, atmospheric massloss proceeds at a finite rate dictated by the escape rate of molecules at the Bondi radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Owen &amp; Wu 2016)</ref>. Since the hydrodynamic flow needs to pass through the sonic point and since the mass flux is conserved, it is convenient to determine the mass-loss rate at the sonic point,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R s = GM p /2c 2 s , where c s = (k B T eq /µ) 1/2</formula><p>is the isothermal speed of sound. This yields a mass-loss rate of M = 4πρ s R 2 s c s , where ρ s is the density at the sonic point, which can be related to the density at the radiative convective boundary by ρ s = ρ r cb exp(−2R s /R r cb ) in the limit that R s &gt;&gt; R r cb . The mass-loss rate at the Bondi radius can therefore be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">M B atm = 4πR 2 s c s ρ r cb exp − GM p c 2 s R r cb .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>From Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">(7)</ref>  percent. The exponential dependence ensures that planets can hold on to their atmospheres because they did not have enough time for loss at larger orbital periods and/or that the cooling timescale can become shorter than the mass-loss timescale as a planet contracts during its evolution terminating any further mass-loss.</p><p>We follow the evolution of a given planet by simultaneously calculating its cooling and its atmospheric-loss due to core-powered mass-loss. The energy of the planet decreases as a function of time as dictated by its internal luminosity, such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E cool (t + dt) = E cool (t) − L(t)dt,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where L is given by Equation (6). Similarly, the evolution of the atmospheric mass can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">M atm (t + dt) = M atm (t) − min M E atm (t), M B atm (t) dt,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where the mass-loss rate at the Bondi radius is given by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">(7)</ref> and M E atm L(t)/gR c is the energy-limited mass-loss rate. The minimum of these two loss rates determines the rate at which atmospheric loss proceeds as it can be limited by the energy available for cooling or the escape rate of gas molecules from the Bondi radius.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparing the Core-powered Mass-loss</head><p>Results with Observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. (2018)</ref> already demonstrated that the corepowered mass-loss mechanism itself produces a bimodal exoplanet radius distribution and that it yields results consistent with the observed valley in the radius distribution of close-in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Here we extend this comparison from a single histogram of planet radii to twodimensional orbital period-planet radius parameter space and use our results to infer properties of the observed exoplanet population. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> displays our core-powered mass-loss results and compares it with the observations from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> and . The left panel shows the histogram of relative occurrence of planet radii from our model (red) and observations (grey) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fulton et al. 2017</ref>). To facilitate the comparison between our results and observations, we display and normalize our results over the same planet radius range as for the observations shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. As shown in previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. 2018</ref>), we find good agreement between the radius distribution produced by the core-powered mass-loss mechanism and the observed exoplanet population. The left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows that the valley is located between ∼ 1.5-2.0 R ⊕ with a width of ∼ 0.5 R ⊕ . The lower peak of the 'super-Earths', i.e., planets stripped of their envelopes, is at 1.2-1.4 R ⊕ and the higher peak of the 'sub-Neptunes', i.e., planets that kept most of their atmospheres, is at 2.0-2.7 R ⊕ .</p><p>The middle panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> presents our results in the two-dimensional parameter space of planet size and orbital period. The right panel shows the observational results from  for the same two-dimensional parameter space. We generally find good agreement with observations. Specifically, our results display a valley of approximately constant width that moves to smaller planet radii with increasing orbital period. This is a manifestation of the decreasing susceptibility of planets to lose their atmospheres with increasing orbital period. This results in a negative slope for the valley, which is plotted as a dashed line in the middle panel. . We discuss the physical processes determining the slope and analytically derive the slope of the valley in Section 3.2.</p><p>The degree of similarity between observations and the core-powered mass-loss results presented here demonstrates envelopes with mass fractions of a few percent. Because both mass loss mechanisms are more efficient at high levels of incident stellar flux, they both predict that the population of sub-Neptunes should be offset to lower insolation fluxes compared to the super-Earths A key difference between the two mechanisms is the expected dependence on stellar mass. Core-powered mass loss depends only on properties of the planet and bolometric incident stellar flux. All else being equal, this mechanism predicts no dependence of the planet population as a function of M�. In contrast, the efficiency of photoevaporation depends on the time-integrated XUV flux, or "fluence." This quantity is a strong function of stellar mass since <ref type="bibr">et al. 2012</ref>).

As shown in Section 2, whether a planet has enough energy to lose its envelope is solely dictated by the envelope to core mass-fraction, f , which has, to first order, no dependence on the distance from the host star (see Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(1)</ref>) and therefore corresponds to a single planet size independent of period. We find that it is the mass-loss timescale, due to its exponential dependence on period and planet size, that creates the valley and determines the slope in the planet radius and orbital period space. Specifically, we find that the criterion t cool = t loss separates the planets that will end up above and below the valley, since once planets can cool faster than they can lose mass (i.e., t cool &lt; t loss ), they shrink in size and any subsequent mass-loss is hence cut-off rapidly due to the exponential dependence on planet size of the mass-loss timescale (see Section 2). Furthermore, due to the exponential dependence in the mass-loss timescale, it is, to first order, the exponent that determines the slope of the valley in the radius-period parameter space. Setting the mass-loss timescale equal to the cooling timescale, we have from Equation (7) that GM p /c 2 s R r cb constant and hence</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">R 4 c P 1/3 R p ρ 4/3 c * R 3 p P 1/3 ρ 4/3 c * = constant,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where we substituted for the speed of sound and the massradius relation of the core and used the fact that R r cb = R p 2R c . As long as a planet's core density has no semimajor axis dependence, Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref> yields R p ∝ P −1/9</p><p>which corresponds to a slope in the logarithmic parameter space of planet radius and orbital period of</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">d logR p d logP = − 1 9 −0.11.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>This is in excellent agreement with the observed slope reported by Van Eylen et al. , based on high precision asteroseismic measurements of stellar parameters. The middle panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows a dashed line denoting the center of the observed valley. The slope of this line, as measured from our numerical simulations, is in full agreement with our analytical estimate above. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref> shows that the valley's slope in the radius-period space does, to first order, not depend on f , properties of the host star or the core density as these only change the constant in Equation (12) but not the power-law relation between R p and P. These quantities, do however, change the location of the valley, which is set by the constant in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref> and which we will come back to when examining the dependence of our results on the core composition in Section 3.3. 1 The one quantity that does change the slope of the valley is the mass-radius relationship of the core. Specifically, we find from Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">(7)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_19">that d logR p d logP 1 3(1 − β)</formula><p>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">M c ∝ R β c .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Precise observational measurements of the valley's slope are therefore able to determine the exoplanet mass-radius relation of the core. We find that published measurements of the slope (Van Eylen et al. 2018) are in agreement with M c /M ⊕ ∝ (R c /R ⊕ ) 4 but inconsistent with M c /M ⊕ ∝ (R c /R ⊕ ) 3 , highlighting the significance of internal compression of cores more massive than Earth. ). While the case with rocky cores closely resembles the observations (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>, for icy and iron cores the valley shifts to a much higher and lower size, respectively. To aid the comparison between our results and observations, we normalized our findings over the same planet radius range as the observations, but display our numerical results down to planet sizes that are smaller than the smallest observed radius bin in Fulton et al. (2017).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Constraints on the Core Composition</head><p>We investigate the dependence of our results on composition of the exoplanet cores. We account for changes in core material by modifying the core density (ρ c * ) and its molecular mass (µ c ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Single Composition Cores</head><p>As we can see from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref>, the slope of the valley should remain unchanged by changes in uncompressed core density, ρ c * , but its location scales as ρ c * , where β is the exponent in the mass-radius relation of the core. We therefore expect the slope to remain the same but the location of the valley to move to larger planet radii for lower density cores and to smaller planet radii for high density cores. This is exactly what we find numerically in our results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> for cores made of ice and iron. From the scaling with core composition above, we predict that the bottom of the valley should move up by a factor of 1.9 from about 1.6R p to about 3.0R p for icy core and move down by a factor of 0.7 for iron cores from about 1.6R p to about 1.1R p compared to our rocky 'reference' case, which is indeed what is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. Another implication of the exponential dependence on core density is that the characteristics of the final radius distribution are, to first order, not affected by the changes in µ c .</p><p>Finally, our numerical results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> confirm that, while there are significant changes in the location of the valley for the different core compositions, the slope of the valley remains essentially unchanged, as expected. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Maximum Water/Ice Content of Super-Earths and Sub-Neptune Cores</head><p>The strong dependence of the valley's location on the density of planetary cores implies that we can, not only constrain the bulk composition of the cores of super-Earths and subNeptunes, but that we can also place limits on their maximum water/ice content. We demonstrate this in an example in which we assume a core composition that initially consists of 1/3 iron (ρ c * = 11 g cm −3 ) and 2/3 silicate (ρ c * = 4 g cm −3 ) by mass, and then add the maximum amount of water-ice (ρ c * = 1.3 g cm −3 ) that can reproduce the observations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> shows that 16% of water-ice can be added to Earth-like composition cores without causing a noticeable discrepancy between our core-powered mass-loss results and the observations. This implies that, first, the location of the valley constrains the bulk density of the super-Earth and sub-Neptune population and, second, this in turn can be used to place limits on their possible compositions. Overall we find, similar to photoevaporation studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Owen &amp; Wu 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jin &amp; Mordasini 2018)</ref>, that cores must be predominantly rocky with water-ice fractions of less than ∼ 20%. Alternatively, we can conclude from the location of the valley and the peaks for the different core compositions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> that the fraction of pure water/ice worlds and pure iron cores must be relatively small.</p><p>These inferences imply that most of the close-in superEarths and sub-Neptunes formed in a water/ice poor environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Dependence on Planet-mass Distribution</head><p>We also investigate the sensitivity of our results to the underlying distribution of planet masses (M p M c ). Specifically, we keep the Rayleigh distribution and the inverse-square tail, but change the value of σ M ; see Equation (11). Figure 5 displays our 'reference' case (left panel) and results for σ M = 2.0M ⊕ and σ M = 5.0M ⊕ in the middle and right panel, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> shows that for a lower σ M , i.e., for an underlying distribution peaking at a lower planet mass, the peak below the valley is more significant than in the 'reference' case. In contrast, for higher values of σ M the peak above the valley is more pronounced. However, any changes in the mass distribution do not fundamentally change the location of the valley itself. This implies that the location of the valley does not depend on the detailed assumptions of the planet-mass distribution (as long as it is chosen to cover the observed parameter space in planet radii/masses), but is determined by the planet's core composition instead (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> and discussion in Section 3.3). In contrast, the relative magnitude of the peaks above and below the valley is sensitive to the details of the underlying planet-mass distribution and it can hence be used to constrain the planet population from observations. Similar to previous studies, we find a Rayleigh distribution with an inverse-square tail, with σ M ∼ 3.0M ⊕ , yields a good fit to the observations; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>.</p></div>

To distinguish our results from any atmospheric loss due to photoevaporation, we only considered the planet's evolution due to its own cooling luminosity and its subsequent mass-loss, i.e., we focus on the planet's evolution due to the core-powered mass-loss mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. , 2018</ref>.</p><p>We demonstrated that planetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e., without any photoevaporation) is capable of reproducing the observed valley in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets. In particular, we are able to match the valley's position, shape, slope and the relative magnitude of the peaks above and below the valley. Our results are in good agreement with observations both when examining the histogram of planet sizes and the two-dimensional planet size-orbital period parameter space. Our findings imply that even super-Earths that appear as barren rocky cores today likely formed with primordial hydrogen and helium envelopes and that they are therefore not true terrestrial planet analogs from the point of view of their formation.</p><p>We analytically derive the slope of the valley by equating the atmospheric mass-loss timescale to the cooling timescale and find a slope for the valley d logR p /d logP −0.11. This is identical to the slope that we find from our numerical evolution models and is in good agreement with the value reported by Van Eylen et al. (2018), −0.09 +0.02 −0.04 . We find, both numerically and analytically, that the slope of the valley is, to first order, independent of the core density and planet-mass distribution, but that it does depend on the mass-radius relation of the core. Precise observational measurements of the valley's slope should therefore probe the exoplanet mass-radius relation of the core. We find that published measurements of the slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Van Eylen et al. 2018</ref>) are in agreement with M c /M ⊕ ∝ (R c /R ⊕ ) 4 but inconsistent with M c /M ⊕ ∝ (R c /R ⊕ ) 3 , highlighting the significance of internal compression of cores more massive than Earth.</p><p>In addition to understanding the formation of the valley itself, we investigated the dependence of our results on core composition and planet-mass distribution, and compared our findings with observations from recent exoplanet studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fulton et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Van Eylen et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>By varying the density and mean molecular mass of the cores, we demonstrated analytically and numerically that the location of the valley depends primarily on the core's density and that it shifts to larger (smaller) planetary radii for lower (higher) density cores. This implies that the location of the valley constrains, to first order, the bulk density of the super-Earth and sub-Neptune population. We find that cores must be predominantly rocky with typical water-ice fractions of less than ∼ 20% to match observations. Alternatively, we conclude from the location of the valley and the peaks for the different core compositions that the fraction of  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(11)</ref> for details.

(2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that a planet's own cooling luminosity is capable of reproducing the observed valley in the radius distribution of close-in planets. Although atmospheric loss by the core-powered mass-loss mechanism seems an inevitable by-product of atmospheric accretion and the planet formation process itself, our results should not be taken to imply that atmospheric loss by photoevaporation does not happen or that it has to be unimportant. In fact, it seems likely that both processes contributed to sculpting the observed exoplanet population. Our work demonstrates that the core-powered mass-loss mechanism ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ginzburg et al. , 2018</ref> yields similar results to the photoevaporation mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Owen &amp; Wu 2017</ref>) in terms of the existence, location and slope of the radius valley, core composition, and the core mass distribution. This implies that, regardless of which of the two mechanism dominates (if any), the conclusions concerning, for example, the core composition and the implications that most super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are water-ice poor, are independent of the mass-loss mechanism.</p><p>In future work, we plan to combine photoevaporation with the core-powered mass-loss mechanisms, and to extend the current investigation to a range of stellar types with the hope to be able to disentangle the specific signatures these two mechanisms leave in the observed exoplanet population.</p></div>
