				<p>The Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative (YETI) is a project focused on the pho-tometric monitoring of stellar open clusters in order to find new young transiting exoplanets, eclipsing binaries and study other variability phenomena. Here, we present the status of the initiative and plans for future photometric campaigns of three open clusters younger than 50 Myr: NGC 869, NGC 884 and IC 4665, by using the worldwide one meter-class telescope network. Based on the experience gained by several astronomical observatories included in this network, dedicated numerical algorithms and recent results obtained during the first observing campaigns , we expect to confirm several young transiting objects: low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and exoplanets. The photometric precision given for a typical telescope used in this project, allows for transit detection of Jupiter-size planets at close-in orbits with periods up to ∼ 30 days and also hundreds of new various variable stars.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The primary goal of YETI is to search for transiting extrasolar planets and eclipsing binaries younger than 100 Myr and, therefore, to deliver a number of the youngest exoplanetary systems presently known. A detailed study of several carefully selected eclipsing binaries detected in open clusters with known ages and distances is necessary in order to determine reliable orbital and physical parameters of companions (exoplanets, brown-dwarfs, or low-mass stars of late spectral types). Eclipsing binaries detected in the low-mass regime can deliver valuable observational constraints on the mass-radius relation, which remains scarce in the domain of pre-main sequence stars and brown dwarfs. As a byproduct, we investigate also other types of variabilities in the monitored stars on different time-scales, including rotating and pulsating stars, irregular variables, flares, T Tauri stars, etc., which are extremely interesting from the astrophysical point of view.</p><p>The long-term motivation of YETI is to test star and planet formation scenarios by gathering robust observational indications on the early evolution of low-mass stellar, substellar and planetary objects. Despite the fact that we know more than 3700 exoplanets 1 today, there is a lack of confirmed transiting exoplanets around stars younger than 100 Myr (there are only four such exoplanets, where one of them -CVSO 30b was confirmed within YETI by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Raetz et al. 2016</ref>). The vast majority of clusters surveyed for transits are several Gyr old and this is one of the main reasons why we cannot answer the question whether giant planets form by gravitational contraction or by core accretion. In addition, among low-mass pre-main sequence stars, there are only very few eclipsing spectroscopic binary stars known, so there is a lack of precise parameter determinations. None of the known models can give correct masses for low-mass pre-main sequence stars -the models are still not correct for ages below 10 Myr. To improve this situation, the YETI network ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) was established by searching for transiting planets and eclipsing binaries in young clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Target clusters and observations</head><p>The open clusters presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>   age of the cluster (younger than 100 Myr which is the pre-main sequence time-scale of the lowest mass stars), the intermediate distance, the size and location of the cluster on the sky. Observational strategy within the YETI campaign is based on photometric monitoring of target clusters by using small class telescopes, roughly three times per year per cluster where one run is typically 14 days long. During the campaign, the CCD observations are conducted only with the Bessell R-band filter, by applying alternating short and long exposures to accommodate bright and faint stars in the cluster. Based on the modern methods of data reduction and analysis of variable stars we are able to detect of any transit with a depth of at least 5 mmag rms down to R = 14.5 mag, and 50 mmag rms down to R = 16.5 mag stars. For targets with periodic transit-like signals the follow-up observations are carried out (i.e., high-quality photometry to improve transit light curve, low-and high-resolution spectroscopy to ensure that the star is young and confirm the substellar nature of the companion by RV (radial velocity) variation analysis, adaptive optics IR (infrared) imaging to exclude other bright eclipsing stars in the larger PSF (point spread function).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results overview</head><p>• Transiting planet candidates Several transiting candidates were already identified in the YETI data. For the first candidate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Errmann et al., 2014</ref>) all follow-ups are already done, while the other candidates needs further investigations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Garai et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fritzewski et al., 2016)</ref>. High-resolution imaging</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pawee l Zieli´nskiZieli´nski, et al.</formula><p>and RV spectroscopy for the first candidate yields a companion mass consistent with that of a M5 to M6 dwarf, hence it is a false positive. The most promising and extremely unique planetary candidate so far is the system found around the star CVSO 30. This is the youngest known exoplanet system with both a close-in transiting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Raetz et al., 2016</ref>) and a wide directly imaged ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Schmidt et al., 2016</ref>) planet candidates orbiting their host star.</p><p>• Eclipsing binaries We found hundreds of new eclipsing binaries in the YETI photometric measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Errmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Garai et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fritzewski et al., 2016)</ref>. Only for Trumpler 37 we found more than 50 new eclipsing binaries. The study of binary stars clearly shows the importance of using the telescope network in order to fully complete the phase-coverage of brightness changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Neuhäuser et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>• Rotation periods of young stars We can also study the angular momentum evolution of low-mass pre-main sequence stars during their contraction toward the main sequence. The rotation period distribution of the T Tauri stars in 25 Ori ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Karim et al., 2016)</ref> and IC 348 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Fritzewski et al., 2016)</ref> shown that these stars typically rotate at a small fraction of their breakup velocity, despite the significant contraction in stellar radius, what is the subject of the discussion.</p><p>• Other variability phenomena Except of different types of variable stars (rotating and pulsating stars with 1 h &lt; P &lt; 300 d, flaring stars, T Tauri type stars, irregular variables) discovered in the YETI data, we are able to study already known variables. For example, GM Cep has been known to be an abrupt variable and to have a circumstellar disk with a very active accretion. Our observations reveal ∼ 1 mag brightness drops with period of ∼2 yr. These drops might be caused by the obscuration of the central star by an orbiting clump of dust in the protoplanetary disk around the star, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chen et al. (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Future outlook</head><p>The small telescopes that form the YETI network enable us to detect transits of extrasolar planets. The photometric precision acquired within YETI project is sufficient for the detection of Jupiter-size planets around G and K stars in the cluster fields. On the example diagram <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>) we show that for the brightest stars a standard deviation of less than 5 mmag in the light curve is reached in a single night. For 1200 stars brighter than R = 16 mag and observed in Search for young transiting exoplanets within YETI project case, we will be able to increase the number of known young transiting planets by a factor of up to three.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: The complete list of all YETI target clusters.
