			<abstract>
				<p>Context. Asteroseismology has been impressively boosted during the last decade mainly thanks to space missions such as Kepler/K2 and CoRoT. This has a large impact, in particular, in exoplanetary sciences since the accurate characterization of the exoplanets is convoluted in most cases with the characterization of their hosting star. Until the expected launch of the ESA mission PLATO 2.0, there is almost a decade where only two important missions will provide short-cadence high-precision photometric time-series: NASA-TESS and ESA-CHEOPS missions, both having high capabilities for exoplanetary sciences. Aims. In this work we want to explore the asteroseismic potential of CHEOPS time-series. Methods. Following the works done for estimating the asteroseismic potential of Kepler and TESS, we have analyzed the probability of detecting solar-like pulsations using CHEOPS light-curves. Since CHEOPS will collect runs with observational times from hours up to a few days, we have analyzed the accuracy and precision we can obtain for the estimation of ν max , the only asteroseismic observable we can recover using CHEOPS observations. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of knowing ν max in the characterization of exoplanet host stars. Results. Using CHEOPS light-curves with the expected observational times we can determine ν max for massive G and F-type stars from late Main Sequence on, and for F, G, and K-type stars from post-Main Sequence on with an uncertainty lower than a 5%. For magnitudes V&lt;12 and observational times from eight hours up to two days, the HR zone of potential detectability changes. The determination of ν max leads to an internal age uncertainty reduction in the characterization of exoplanet host stars from 52% to 38%; mass uncertainty reduction from 2.1% to 1.8%; radius uncertainty reduction from 1.8% to 1.6%; density uncertainty reduction from 5.6% to 4.7%, in our best scenarios.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>CHEOPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fortier et al., 2014</ref>) is the first small European Space Agency mission (ESA S-mission). Its launch is expected at the end of 2018 and its main scientific goal is the accurate characterization of transiting exoplanetary systems.</p><p>CHEOPS will collect high precision photometry, of the order of parts-per-million (ppm), depending on the stellar magnitude, in short cadence (1 minute). These precision and cadence are similar to those reached by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Gilliland et al., 2010</ref>) and CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baglin et al., 2006</ref>), but in the case of CHEOPS for brighter stars than with Kepler since its telescope aperture is significantly smaller (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>With this work, we aim to explore the potential of CHEOPS for asteroseismic studies of exoplanet host stars. There are a number of studies in the literature showing the benefit of obtaining asteroseismic observables of exoplanet host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bazot et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vauclair et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Escobar et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Moya, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Huber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lillo-Box et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Silva Aguirre et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Huber, 2018)</ref>. These additional observables allow a more precise determination of stellar mass, radius, and age, having a direct impact on the understanding of the exoplanetary system. Although in recent years the number of techniques for characterizing exoplanets independently of the stellar generic physical values has increased, in general the exoplanet observations are convoluted with the star, and characterizing the planets means to deconvolute the stellar contribution from the observables. On the other hand, the age of the system is critical from an astrobiological point of view and to model and explain the dynamical evolution of exoplanetary systems. Evaluating whether an exoplanet has had enough time for developing detectable biomarkers can only be done by knowing the age of the planet. Nowadays, the only way of dating an exoplanet is dating its hosting star (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barrado, 2016</ref>, for a review). An additional benefit of the asteroseismic studies of photometric time-series is the proper removal of these oscillations from the light-curve, allowing a more accurate modeling of the observing transits, mainly their ingress and egress.</p><p>Among the more than 20 known pulsational types along the HR-diagram ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aerts et al., 2010)</ref>, solar-like pulsations are one of the most well-known. These oscillations are produced by the convective zone near the surface, exciting stochastically high-order pressure modes in a broad frequency range. In principle, these solar-like oscillations are expected for all stars that posses a convective envelope, as FGK-type stars. Due to the special nature of solar-like oscillations (they pulsate in the frequency asymptotic regime), they provide in first approximation important information about general physical characteristics of the star, such as its mean density and/or its surface gravity. Another important pulsational type for characterizing exoplanet host stars are the so-called δ Scuti pulsations. δ Scuti stars are A-F classical pulsators excited by κ-mechanism <ref type="bibr">(Chevalier, 1971)</ref> with frequencies around the fundamental radial mode, that is, at the middle of the stellar frequency spectrum range.</p><p>Following the works of Chaplin et al. (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Campante et al. (2016)</ref> done in the context of <ref type="bibr">Kepler and TESS (Ricker et al., 2015</ref>) space missions respectively, we have estimated the potential of CHEOPS for detecting solar-like pulsations. We have also studied the impact of different observational times and duty cycles in the accuracy 1 reached for the asteroseismic observables.</p><p>One of the main characteristics of CHEOPS is its short observational time per run, ranging from hours up to a few days in some cases. This makes it impossible to obtain individual frequencies. On the other hand, the frequency with the largest spectrum power (the so-called ν max ) is easier to obtain since its determination only needs the estimation of the Gaussian-like frequency power excess envelope. Therefore, we have focused on the potential observation of ν max using CHEOPS time series, which is a proxy for the stellar log g ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brown et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding, 1995)</ref>. We have also studied the potential of CHEOPS for observing ν max in the case of δ Scuti stars. This is the first time, up to our knowledge, that such a short time series from space are analyzed in an asteroseismic context and the reached precision studied.</p><p>The proper CHEOPS characteristics makes it a perfect space mission for the precise characterization of exoplanetary systems not covered by other past and current missions. In table 1 we present a summary of the main characteristics of these past and current space missions with asteroseismic capabilities. The coverage of the ecliptic plane, its telescope aperture, and its pointing facilities make CHEOPS an unique opportunity for studying certain systems, thus complementing TESS, the other space mission with asteroseismic capabilities during the next decade, besides nano-satellite missions such as BRITE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Weiss et al., 2014</ref>). In particular, the zone of the sky not covered by TESS is the ecliptic plane, roughly in the range Dec = [-6 <ref type="bibr">• , 6 • ]</ref>, where CHEOPS can do its best. In addition, CHEOPS can properly observe fainter stars than TESS due to its larger telescope aperture. For example, besides CHEOPS and TESS magnitudes are not fully equivalent, we can understand the difference comparing the shot noises reached by both missions for a V=12 and I c =12 star respectively. In the case of CHEOPS, a V=12 star can be observed with a shot noise of 623 ppm <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(see table 2</ref>), and TESS can observe a I c =12 star with a shot noise around 1100 ppm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Campante et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, TESS and CHEOPS are complementary missions from an asteroseismic point of view.</p><p>In section 2 we describe the procedure for estimating the solar-like pulsation-detection potential of CHEOPS and show the results obtained, the region in the HR-diagram where these stars are located, and the dependences of the boundaries of this region. In section 3 we study the accuracy we can reach in the determination of ν max for different observational times and duty cycles. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the stellar parameters precision we can obtain when the observable ν max is observed with the accuracy estimated in the previous section. Finally, section 5 is devoted to summarize the conclusions of this study. In the Appendix A we analyze the potential of CHEOPS for observing δ Scuti's ν max and the accuracy we can reach.</p><p>2. Estimation of the detectability potential of solar-like oscillations using CHEOPS Solar-like pulsations are reflected in the frequency power spectrum as a group of peaks with power amplitudes following a Gaussian-like profile. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chaplin et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Campante et al. (2016)</ref>, the estimation of the detectability potential of solar-like pulsations is, therefore, obtained by analyzing in the frequency power spectrum the probability of a Gaussian-like power excess to be statistically different from noise. This analysis is done in three steps: First, using semiempirical relations and stellar models, we estimate the expected strength in the power spectrum of the stellar pulsations (P tot ). Second, we estimate the background power density coming from different sources (B tot ). Finally, we evaluate the probability of the estimated power amplitudes to be statistically different from noise, using the expected signal to noise ratio (S /N tot = P tot /B tot ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Expected power spectrum amplitudes, P tot</head><p>The expected contribution of the pulsational modes to the power spectrum may be approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P tot ≈ 0.5cA 2 max η 2 (ν max )D −2 W ∆ν ppm 2 (1)</formula><p>where A max is the expected maximum amplitude of the radial modes (l = 0) in parts per million (ppm takes into account the apodization of the oscillation signal due to the non-zero integration time in the case of an integration duty cycle of 100%, where ν Nyq is the Nyqvist frequency. ν max is the frequency of the maximum power spectrum in the stellar pulsation regime. D is a dilution factor defined as D = 1 for an isolated object. In this study we will focus in this isolated star case. ∆ν is the so-called large separation or the distance between neighboring overtones with the same spherical degree l. On average, the power of each ν max /∆ν segment will be ∼0.5 times that of the central segment, thus explaining the extra 0.5 factor. Finally, W is the range where the power of the pulsational mode is contained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mosser et al. (2012</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stello et al. (2007)</ref> estimated that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W(ν max ) = 1.32ν 0.88 max , if ν max ≤ 100µHz ν max , if ν max &gt; 100µHz<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The expected A max can be estimated using stellar models from the following semi-empirical relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">A max = 2.5β R R ⊙ 2 T eff T eff,⊙ 0.5 ppm<label>(3)</label></formula><p>This estimation was first derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chaplin et al. (2011)</ref> for the case of the observations of Kepler and it depends on stellar parameters and the instrument response filter. In our case, we can use the same expression without any correction, where R and T eff are the stellar radius and effective temperature, respectively, and R ⊙ and T eff,⊙ the solar values. On the other hand, β is a factor introduced to correct the overestimation that this expression does of the amplitudes for the hottest stars. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β = 1 − exp − T red − T eff 1550 K (4)</formula><p>where T red is the blue boundary of solar-like oscillations (or the red boundary of δ Scuti pulsations) and its empirical estimation is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T red = 8907 L L ⊙ −0.093 K (5)</formula><p>where L is the stellar luminosity and L ⊙ is the corresponding solar value. For a detailed explanation of the origin and assumptions of these expressions, we refer to the papers of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chaplin et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Campante et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Although these estimations have been done under the assumption of an integration duty cycle of 100%, duty cycles larger than 60%, as it is the case of CHEOPS lightcurves, have a negligible impact in the estimated power excess and in the obtaining of ν max <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Stahn &amp; Gizon, 2008)</ref> 2.2. Estimation of the total background power, B tot</p><p>The background power spectral density in the zone of ν max can be approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">B tot ≈ b max W(ν max ) ppm 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The main contributions to b max are assumed to be the instrumental/astronomical noises (jitter, flat field, timing error, etc., on the one hand, photon noise, zodiacal light, etc., on the other), and the stellar granulation. This second contribution has a significant impact when the observations of the oscillations are made using photometry. That is: </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">b max = b instr + P gran ppm 2 µHz −1<label>(7)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">P gran,real (ν max ) = η 2 (ν max )D −2 2 i=1 2 √ 2 π a 2 i b i 1 + ν max b i 4 ppm 2 µHz −1 (9)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">a 1,2 = 3382 ν −0.609 max (10a) b 1 = 0.317 ν 0.970 max (10b) b 2 = 0.948 ν 0.992 max (10c)</formula><p>The parameters of these models have been fitted using the power spectra of a large set of Kepler targets. Therefore, we can use these estimations without any correction for CHEOPS thanks to their similar response filters.</p><p>Another effect to take into account when modeling granulation is aliasing. When the observed signal has frequencies above the Nyqvist frequency, they can appear in the power spectrum at sub-Nyqvist frequencies since these frequencies are undersampled, contributing to the background noise. With a cadence of 60 sec and its associated large ν Nyq , the impact of this aliased granulation power in the final background noise is small, but we have included it for completeness. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Campante et al. (2016)</ref>, the aliased granulation power at ν max can be modeled as P gran,aliased (ν max ) ≡ P gran,real (ν ′ max ), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ν ′ max = ν Nyq + (ν Nyq − ν max ), if ν max ≤ ν Nyq ν Nyq − (ν max − ν Nyq ), if ν Nyq &lt; ν max ≤ 2ν Nyq</formula><p>and then P gran = P gran,real (ν max ) + P gran,aliased (ν max ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Asteroseismic scaling relations</head><p>In Sections 2.1 and 2.2 we have seen that for the estimation of the expected spectrum power excess and background, the asteroseismic parameters ∆ν and ν max must be known. The most efficient way of doing so is by means of the so-called scaling relations. These relations explode the fact that ∆ν and ν max are a function of the stellar mean density and surface gravity respectively. Therefore, they can be approximately estimated when stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature have reasonable estimates. In our study these stellar parameters, using solar metallicity, are provided by stellar models obtained using the evolutionary code CLES (Code Liégeois d'Evolution Stellaire, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Scuflaire et al., 2008)</ref>. Then, using the scaling relations shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kallinger &amp; Matthews (2010)</ref>, and references therein, we estimate ∆ν and ν max . That is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ν max ≈ ν max,⊙ M M ⊙ R R ⊙ −2 T eff T eff,⊙ −0.5 (11) ∆ν ≈ ∆ν ⊙ M M ⊙ 0.5 R R ⊙ −1.5 (12)</formula><p>where the solar reference values are ν max,⊙ = 3090µHz and ∆ν ⊙ = 135.1µHz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Estimation of the detection probability</head><p>From stellar models, together with some instrument prescriptions, we can estimate the expected signal to noise ration as S /N tot = P tot /B tot , where P tot and B tot are known. Estimating the detection probability, in this context, is to test whether a given S /N tot can be randomly produced from noise or whether it is a signal of a statistic significant power excess in the original data.</p><p>As we mentioned in the introduction of this section, the solar-like pulsational power excess in the frequency spectrum has a Gaussian-like profile. On the other hand, if T is the length of the time series, the information in the frequency domain comes in bins of 1/T (s −1 ), and the number of bins contained in the potential zone of solar-like pulsation power excess is N = W × T . The N we use in this work has been obtained assuming a duty cycle of a 100%. Nevertheless, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Appourchaux (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Campante (2012)</ref>, the impact of duty cycles in the range [60 -100]%, as it is the case of CHEOPS, is small. Therefore, the statistical test we must perform is to disentangle whether a Gaussianlike profile described using N bins can be produced by a random distribution or not.</p><p>This problem is faced using a χ 2 test with 2N degrees of freedom following <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Appourchaux (2004)</ref>. The first step in this test is to fix a minimum threshold avoiding a false alarm positive (S /N thres ). This limit is fixed at a 5% of a chance of false positive (p-value &lt; 0.05). That is, if we define x = 1 + S /N, the p-value of this test is  where ν max can be determined using eight hours of CHEOPS observations. Black points are the models used aligned in different evolutionary tracks. The evolutionary stage of these models are represented in different point transparency: MS stars in black, Sub-Giant dark gray, and Giant in light gray. The orange line is the bottom limit for a potential detection of a star with Magnitude V=6. The same bottom limit for the case of a star with V=9 is shown with a red line. The blue line is the bottom limit for a V=12 star. The green line represents the top limit for a correct coverage of the variability with eight hours of observational time.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p = ∞ x exp(−x ′ ) Γ(N) x ′(N−1) dx ′ (13)</formula><p>where Γ is the Gamma function. S /N thres is the one making p = 0.05. Since N is a function of ν max , every model has its own threshold. Once S /N thres is obtained, the probability of a given excess to be statistically different from random noise is</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">p excess = ∞ y exp(−y ′ ) Γ(N) y ′(N−1) dy ′<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">y = (1 + S /N thres )/(1 + S /N tot ).</formula><p>Therefore, for a given stellar model (M, R, T eff , ∆ν, and ν max ), an observational time range (T ), and a stellar magnitude, we can calculate the probability of the solar-like pulsations to be observed.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> we show a HR diagram with the evolutionary tracks used for the simulations and the bottom limit for a p excess = 50% of detection probability for three different stellar magnitudes (orange, red and blue lines for V = 6, 9, and 12 stars respectively). Every star above these lines has a ν max potentially detectable by CHEOPS. On the other hand, integration and total observing times may put some constraints to our observational capabilities: Obs. Time=2d</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2: HR Diagram</head><p>showing the region where ν max can be determined, for a star with magnitude V=6, using different observational times. Black points are the models used aligned in different evolutionary tracks. The evolutionary stage of these models are represented in different point transparency: MS stars in black, Sub-Giant dark gray, and Giant in light gray. The orange lines are the bottom and top limits of the potentially ν max detection region for eight hours of observational time (respectively red lines -two days of observational time, blue lines -ten days of observational time). The upper detectability limit for an observational time of 10 days is outside the plotted range. The position of the current known stars with planets in the ecliptic plane with V&lt;6 is shown using green triangles. The small and more transparent green triangles are those known stars with planets in the ecliptic plane with 6&lt;V&lt;9.</p><p>-Integration time: As we have already explained, changing the integration time is not efficient in our context and we have fixed it to 60 sec, imposing limits to the ν max that can be properly monitored. Each stellar model has its own ν max , depending on stellar parameters following Eq. 11. The largest ν max is located at the orange line of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> with a value of 1765 µHz, that is, around 9.5 min. Therefore, the integration time of 1 min is enough for covering properly every potentially detectable ν max (ν Nyq =8333 µHZ, covering all the frequency range).</p><p>-Total observing time: One of the most conservative goals of our time series is to monitor at least one complete period for all the solar-like modes at the expected frequency range. For a given ν max , eq. 2 shows that the shortest expected frequency (largest expected period) is, roughly, 0.5ν max . That is, for a given total observational time (T ), we can ensure to monitor at least one complete period for all the expected solar-like modes of stars with ν max = 2/T . The green line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> represent the limit of ν max = 69 µHz. Every star below this limit can be correctly monitored with eight hours of observing time. Obs. Time=2d</p></div>

V=9 Therefore, with the most conservative election of the different degrees of freedom, every star with characteristics in the region limited by the orange/red/blue lines and the green line of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> has a ν max potentially detectable with CHEOPS with eight hours of observational time.</p><p>In any case, the total observing time can be modified. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs. 2 to 4</ref> we show the impact of changing the observational time up to ten days in the definition of the potentially detectable region.</p><p>Although the general observational strategy of CHEOPS is to spend several hours per target, in some special cases a larger observational time will be accessible, as it is the case of orbiting phase studies. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> we show the impact of increasing this observational time. The three lines represent the theoretical limits, for a 6th magnitude star, as a function of the total observational time. This observational time impacts in two ways: on one hand, increasing the accuracy of the signal mapping in the frequency domain (reducing the size of the bins), and on the other hand, allowing the study of larger periods. That is, it pushes down the bottom limit for potential detectability and pushes up the top limit in the Red Giant Branch. The impact of having eight hours of observing time (orange lines), two days (red lines), or ten days (blue lines) is what we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figs. 2, 3</ref>, and 4 for a V = 6, 9, and 12 star respectively. The increasing of the area enabling a potential ν max characterization is remarkable.</p><p>In the Introduction we mentioned that CHEOPS and TESS are complementary in terms of their asteroseismic capabilities. We have identified that, nowadays, there are 169 stars harbouring planets located at the ecliptic plane (Dec. = <ref type="bibr">[-6,6]</ref> • ).

Depending on the observational time, tens of stars with planets located at the ecliptic plane can be characterized with a larger precision (see sections 3 and 4).</p><p>Increasing the observational time within CHEOPS accepted observational strategy has a large impact on the HR diagram zone of potential detectability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Impact of observational time and duty cycle in the accuracy of the determination of ν max</head><p>In the previous section, we have analyzed whether solarlike pulsations can be potentially detectable with CHEOPS depending on the different instrumental and observational constraints, but we have not described which observables can be obtained from these observations and the accuracy of this characterization.</p><p>As we have already mentioned, the total observational time per target will be of the order of hours or a few days. This is not enough for disentangling individual frequencies (discarding ∆ν as a possible observable), but it is enough for obtaining the frequency with the maximum power amplitude. Therefore, we will focus our studies on how accurately we can determine ν max and the impact of this additional observable in the characterization of the targets.</p><p>The total observational time (T ) has an impact in the HR diagram zone where ν max can be potentially detected, but it has also an impact on the accuracy of the determination of its value from observations. T has a major impact on the definition of the numbers of bins we will have in the frequency domain (N = W × T ). The larger the T , the larger the number of bins and, therefore, the better the mapping of this frequency space. Since ν max is the frequency of the maximum of the Gaussian-like envelope the solar-like pulsations describe in the power spectrum, a better mapping of this zone implies a more accurate determination of this maximum. On the other hand, solar-like oscillations are forced oscillations of stable pulsational modes. Therefore, every individual mode has a certain lifetime. With the time, modes appear and disappear. A small T will act as a picture of the living modes at this moment. They don't ensure a perfect definition of ν max . The larger the T , the larger the number of observed modes, contributing to a more precise estimation of the global envelope.</p><p>Therefore, we expect a dependence of the accuracy in the determination of ν max with T .</p><p>In addition, the duty cycle produces a spurious signal in the frequency domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mosser et al., 2009)</ref>, with a potential impact on the determination of ν max . Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stahn &amp; Gizon (2008)</ref>, the impact of duty cycles larger than 60 % in the determination of the position and/or   power of a frequency in the Fourier domain is negligible. Nevertheless, we have studied this impact using Kepler data.</p><p>To measure the extent of these dependencies, we have simulated different realistic cases and tested the potential accuracy we can reach with CHEOPS data. To do so, we have used ten real cases as reference, displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. We have analyzed a group of Short-Cadence (SC) Kepler light-curves of eight well-known Main Sequence stars and two giants. The choosing of SC is due to its similarity with CHEOPS integration time. In that way, we can compare the value of ν max taking into account shorter light curves and lower duty cycles with the reference ones obtained with the complete light-curves. The duty cycle of CHEOPS is strongly determined by the SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly) and also by the Earth occultation (EO). These effects depend on the orbital parameters and the position of the star during the run. We used the CHEOPSim tool (see Sect. 5) in order to simulate several effective times of observation and the timing of the gaps at different sky positions, that is, we simulate different duty cycle values (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>, column "SAA &amp; EO"). These simulations are superimposed on the Kepler light-curves (column "Complete"). In that way, the duty cycle of the light curves we used is lower due to the own duty cycle of the original Kepler light-curves. Finally, we interpolate these gaps with a linear fit.</p><p>We use the weighted mean frequency to calculate the frequency at maximum power ( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ν max,w = A i ν i A i<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where A i and ν i are the amplitude and frequency of each peak of the power spectra, respectively. We also define the efficiency of detection as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Eff(%) = 100 · N detections N all (16)</formula><p>where N all is the number of runs for a fixed length and duty cycle, taking into account all tested stars, and N detections is the number of significant detections inside the detection range ν max,w ∈ ν max,est ± 5∆ν est , where ν max,est and ∆ν est are C1 : ν ∈ ν max, est ± 5∆ ν est C1 : ν ∈ ν max, est ± 5∆ ν est  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 5</ref> where the relative error, defined as the relative difference between the measured and the reference ν max values, is calculated for several 1-day runs for one of our testing stars. We obtained values within the detection range for most of the runs (purple line). However, one single run can introduce a considerably high relative error (∼ 34%).</p><p>For that reason, we studied two different cases: The first case (C1) taking into account the ν max,est ± 5∆ν est range, and the second one with a shorter range (C2; ν max,est ±2∆ν est ). We can use these ranges because the distribution of p-modes of the solar-oscillator power spectra around its ν max is approximately symmetric (they have an asymmetry of ∼ 3%, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kallinger &amp; Matthews 2010)</ref>. We noted that a high accuracy of ν max,est and ∆ν est are not required since we only need them to roughly estimate the range where ν max is searched.</p><p>To study the influence of the duty cycle in the determination of ν max , we have analyzed the ten stars of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table  4</ref>. Since for solar-like pulsations the S/N level achieved by Kepler for a particular magnitude star will be achieved by CHEOPS for a brighter star, in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> we show the S/N of these testing Kepler stars and not their magnitudes. Our study is valid, therefore, when these S/N are reached. We have divided again their light-curves in runs of a fixed observational time. We have then imposed the CHEOPS duty C1 : ν ∈ ν max, est ± 5∆ ν est Dashed lines are ± their standard deviation cycle and obtained the ν max of every run. Finally we have obtained the mean values of the relative error in the determination of ν max compared with the reference value per duty cycle for all the stars and runs, the mean maximum relative error, the detection efficiency, and their standard deviations.</p><p>In the case C1, the mean relative error for observational times of one day (top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 6</ref>) is in the range [3.8, 4.5]%, depending on the duty cycle. In general, the larger the duty cycle, the lower the mean relative error. The mean maximum relative error ranges between [12.5, 15]% for an observational time of one day (top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 7)</ref>. Again, the larger the duty cycle, the lower the mean maximum relative error. In terms of the detection efficiency, in the case of observational times of one day (top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 8</ref>), this efficiency is almost stable at a value of 99.6% for every duty cycle. In the rest of the panels of Figs. 6 to 8 we can see the effect of increasing the observational time to 2, 4, 8 and 30 days. We noted that the length of the observations for CHEOPS will be relatively short. We include all these lengths to understand the evolution of these values with T up to an observational time similar to that of TESS. In general, the larger the observational time, the lower the mean relative error, the lower the mean maximum relative error and the larger the detection efficiency. If we go into the details, the mean relative error present similar results from 4 days of observational time, on. That is, in terms of a mean relative error, when we use different measurements, the benefit of increasing the observational time is clear up to an observational time of 4 days. For larger observational times this benefit is not so justified. In terms of the mean maximum relative error, that is, the maximum error we achieve in a single run, the increasing of the observational time become in a decreasing of this mean maximum error for every observational time studied, from a range of [12. -The mean maximum error is even better, with a range of <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>% in the case of one day of observational time.</p><p>-The detection efficiency is a little worse, since C2 is more restrictive, with values always larger than 96% and with a 100% from 4 days of observational time, on.</p><p>In conclusion, although there is no large variations of the mean relative error with the duty cycle produced by the SAA or the Earth occultation, we have to take into account the possible high error of an individual measurement. Therefore, several runs are advised to discard those values of ν max out of range. Moreover, the highest accuracy we obtain for ν max , the highest accuracy of ∆ν will be achieved. Then, a proper detection range could be used, improving iteratively our results. In addition, it is not worth to propose observational ranges lager than 4 days if several runs are planned, since the impact of a maximum relative error in a single run is mitigated and no significant improvements in the mean relative error are achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Expected stellar uncertainties</head><p>The basic idea for determining stellar parameters is entering observational quantities such as stellar metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, effective temperature T eff and surface gravity log g (usually available from spectroscopy) in a grid of theoretical models and perform a proper interpolation scheme to retrieve those quantities that best match observations. Asteroseismic ν max is a proxy for log g and its knowledge enables to better constrain the input log g so that to have a refinement of the output stellar parameters. In fact, once the asteroseismic log g is recovered through Eq. 11, spectroscopic and asteroseismic log g can be combined in a weighted mean to obtain a better estimation of the stellar surface gravity and to decrease its uncertainty.</p><p>If ν max is added among the input parameters, in this section we want to:</p><p>1. give a reasonable estimate of the precision we gain in the input log g; 2. test the precision we would gain in the output parameters.</p><p>Given several measurements g i of an observable g, whose uncertainties are σ i , the weighted mean is computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">¯ g = i g i w i i w i (17)</formula><p>where the weight w i = σ −2 i , and its uncertainty is</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">σ ¯ g = 1 i w i (18)</formula><p>Error propagation from Eq. 11 suggests that the relative uncertainty on the derived surface gravity is</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">∆g g = ∆ν max ν max + 1 2 ∆T eff T eff (19)</formula><p>Re-writing Eqs. 17 and 18 in terms of relative uncertainties δ i = σ i /g i , the relative uncertainty on the weighted mean δ ¯ g results to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">δ ¯ g = σ ¯ g ¯ g = n i=1 1 g 2 i δ 2 i n i=1 1 g i δ 2 i (20)</formula><p>where n is the number of available measurements.

Studying δ ¯ g as a function of k, it turns out that it has an absolute minimum for k = 1 i.e. when g 1 = g 2 and that lim k→0 δ ¯ g (k) = δ 2 (i.e. when g 1 ≫ g 2 ), lim k→+∞ δ ¯ g (k) = δ 1 (i.e. when g 2 ≫ g 1 ). Identifying spectroscopic data with the subscript 1 and asteroseismic data with the subscript 2, it turns out that the median relative uncertainty of the spectroscopic surface gravity of the ensemble of CHEOPS reference targets (it's made of 152 stars and their main properties are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>) is ¯ δ 1 ≈ 0.21, while, instead, ¯ δ 2 ≈ 0.055 ≈ ∆ν max ν max</p><p>, assuming 5% as a conservative estimation of the uncertainty on ν max as it comes out from Sect. 3 and considering the weak dependency of Eq. 19 on the relative uncertainty on T eff . Thus, as a median value of reference, ¯ δ 1 ≈ 4 ¯ δ 2 . If this relation holds and if we consider a possible difference of up to a factor of 2 between the two surface gravity determinations g 1 and g 2 , we obtain δ ¯ g (k = 1 2 ) ≈ 0.98δ 2 and δ ¯ g (k = 2) ≈ 0.99δ 2 (the minimum is δ ¯ g (k = 1) ≈ 0.97δ 2 ). This statistical overview suggests that, for a star by star analysis, the maximum value between δ ¯ g (k = 1 2 ) and δ ¯ g (k = 2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">δ * g = max(δ ¯ g (k = 1/2), δ ¯ g (k = 2)) (22)</formula><p>is a reasonably conservative estimate of the relative uncertainty of the weighted mean and this estimate is likely lower than δ 2 . To achieve the second goal, we considered the CHEOPS sample specified in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. The estimate of stellar output parameters has been done thanks to the Isochrone Placement algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bonfanti et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bonfanti et al. ( , 2016</ref>. Interpolation in theoretical grids of tracks and isochrones have been made considering PARSEC 2 evolutionary models, version 1.2S (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bressan et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Chen et al. 2014</ref>; and references therein).</p><p>The code has been run four times. The first time, the input parameters were <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, T eff , log g coming from spectroscopy, v sin i and/or log R ′ HK where available to improve convergence during interpolation, and parallax π and mean G magnitude coming from Gaia DR2 archive 3 so that to have a measure of the stellar luminosity L. If data from Gaia were not available (in 4 cases), parallaxes have been taken from <ref type="bibr">Hipparcos (van Leeuwen, 2007</ref>). We will refer to this set of input data as standard input parameters. At the end of all the cross-matches to retrieve the input parameters, our reference testing sample coming from Cheops is made of 143 stars. The second time, we also wanted to take the contribution from asteroseismology into account. No ν max values are available for the CHEOPS targets so far, therefore, for each star of the sample, we generated a set of possible ν max values. According to the scaling relation (Eq. 11), we computed ν max,input and its uncertainty considering the input values of T eff and log g, so that to establish the maximum range [ν max,input − ∆ν max,input , ν max,input + ∆ν max,input ] of plausible variation of ν max , consistently with the other input parameters. Starting from the left-most side value of the interval, we generated a sequence of ν max,i such that they belong to the interval and whose relative uncertainty was 5%. Each value of the sequence has been obtained by adding to the previous one half of its error bar. This second run of the algorithm involves lots of 'fake' stars because of the arbitrary choice of the ν max,i . Therefore, among all the results, for each star we considered that set of output parameters that match the theoretical models best, which derive from a specific ν max,best value. So, the results we will consider in this case derive from the standard input parameters and the ν max,best . These results represent the best theoretical improvement that is expected for stars located in that region of the HRD once that ν max is added in input. Finally, the third and fourth case consider the standard input parameters plus a value of ν max that has been obtained by decreasing and increasing ν max,best by 10%. In fact, we want also to test whether adding an additional input parameter always determine an improvement in the output uncertainties, regardless of its nominal value.</p><p>After that, we compared the relative uncertainties affecting the output age, mass, radius and mean stellar density in the four runs. The results are synthesized in Tab. 7. In this table we show the median relative uncertainties, a robust indicator against outliers. In general, the inclusion of ν max as an additional observable improves the precision in the determination of the stellar mass, radius, density and age.   the sampling used and the output analyzed. On the one hand, when the used ν max is fully consistent with the selection obtained using the standard inputs (as it is the case ν max,best ), then age uncertainties are reduced from 52% to 38%; mass uncertainties from 2.1% to 1.8%; radius uncertainties from 1.8% to 1.6%; density uncertainties from 5.6% to 4.7%. Repeating this entire analysis without the input Gaia luminosity (which already gives a strong and straightforward constraint on the radius), it turned out that the benefit of adding ν max is even more sensible in reducing the output uncertainties of R and M. On the other hand, when the consistency between the standard selection and ν max is deteriorated, the improvement is also deteriorated. This simulation shows that both the input precision and the consistency among the input parameters play a role in reducing the median output uncertainties. It is worth to add that also the star location on the HRD influences the improvement level in the output uncertainties if we add further input parameter. For instance, if the evolutionary stage of a star is around and soon after the turn-off (TO), there theoretical models are very well spaced, a star can be easily characterized and adding further input parameters don't make change things that much. Instead, if a star is still on the main sequence (MS) or it is well evolved after the TO, there theoretical models are very close and the reduction in the output uncertainties when an input parameter is added may be remarkable. To prove these considerations, we have analyzed the Kepler stars of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, that are almost all around the TO region. We have used the standard constraints T eff , logg, <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, L (and v sin i where available) on the one hand, and we have added the observed ν max with an uncertainty of a 5% as a conservative maximum uncertainty derived from Sect. 3. We have artificially homogenized all the logg uncertainties to a minimum value of 0.1 dex. to reproduce what we usually obtain from spectroscopy. In a median sense, no relevant variations in the output uncertainties is seen adding ν max among the input. Besides the fact that here the consistency between the subgroup fitting the standard observations and the observed ν max is not ensured, the majority of these stars are located around the TO where isochrones are well spaced and Gaia luminosity already provides a precise location for the stars. But if we move on a star-by-star analysis, this Kepler sample contains two stars that are well evolved (i.e. located strongly beyond the TO), namely KIC 5701829 and KIC 9145955. Adding ν max as a further input provokes a reduction in the output parameters of these stars as reported in the following:</p><p>-KIC 5701829. ∆t t from 45% to 18%; ∆M M from 12% to 7%;</p><p>∆R R from 3.3% to 2.8%; ∆ρ ρ from 18% to 11%. -KIC 9145955. ∆t t from 46% to 38%; ∆M M from 13% to 10%; ∆R R from 4.1% to 3.2%; ∆ρ ρ from 23% to 18%. We can conclude that the reductions can be sensible; the improvement in the R precision is less evident just because we already have a precise knowledge of R thanks to Gaia.</p><p>As an important final remark, we stress that all the relative uncertainties we have provided are internal at 1-σ level originating from the interpolation scheme in theoretical models. The statistical treatment, the density of the model grids in use, how the uncertainty on <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> has been addressed, the treatment of the element diffusion enter a complicated picture and have all a role in affecting the output uncertainties. What is relevant here is judging the level of improvement on the output depending on the input set. Moreover let us note that all these results are for a given input physics (e.g. opacities, equation of state, nuclear reaction rates) and a given initial He abundance (that cannot be determined from spectroscopy) in stellar theoretical models. Constraining input physics and/or initial He abundance from asteroseismology requires very high quality individual oscillation frequencies of the star considered, such as those provided by CoRoT or Kepler space missions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lebreton &amp; Goupil 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Buldgen et al. 2016b</ref>,a).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we have studied the asteroseismic potential of CHEOPS. We have found that, with the current instrumental performance and observational times between eight hours and two days, the asteroseismic observable ν max can be determined for massive F and G-type stars from late MS on, and for all F, G, and K-type stars from post-MS on. This observational times perfectly fit the observational strategy of CHEOPS.</p><p>The estimated ν max accuracy, obtained using ten Kepler light-curves as reference, is of the order of 5% or better when the star is observed several times, independently of the expected duty cycles of the CHEOPS targets. In addition, the larger the observational time, the larger the HR Diagram zone where the ν max can be detected and the better the accuracy.</p><p>This accuracy in the determination of ν max is translated into a similar precision in the determination of log g, which is around four times smaller than the precision obtained from spectroscopy, in median values. This new precision and the inclusion of an additional observable for fitting the theoretical models reduce the uncertainty in the determination of the stellar mass, radius, and age depending on the stellar location on the HRD and on the degree of consistency between the expected ν max obtained using standard inputs and the observed one. Having a complete set of spectroscopic input parameters plus the stellar luminosity from Gaia, our theoretical simulation on a testing sample of CHEOPS stars shows that, once a consistent ν max is available in input, in median sense age uncertainty decreases from 52% to 38%, mass uncertainty from 2.1% to 1.8%, radius uncertainty from 1.8% to 1.6% and density uncertainty from 5.6% to 4.7%. All these provided uncertainties are meant to be internal.</p><p>In addition, we have also found that the CHEOPS light curves can provide an accurate estimation of the δ Scuti ν max (see Appendix), leading to a measurement of the stellar rotational rate, its inclination with respect the line of sight, and its mean effective temperature.</p><p>This work open an opportunity for complementing TESS asteroseismic observations since CHEOPS has its technical strengths where TESS has some weaknesses: stars in the ecliptic plane and/or fainter than TESS limit thanks to its larger telescope aperture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: HR Diagram showing the region where ν max can be determined using eight hours of CHEOPS observations.

2.2.1. Instrumental/astronomical noise, b instr 

Following Chaplin et al. (2011), 

b instr = 2 × 10 −6 σ 2 ∆t ppm 2 µHz −1 
(8) 

where σ is the CHEOPS predicted RMS noise per 
a given exposure time (T exp ) and ∆t the integration 
time. Following the CHEOPS Red Book noise budget 
(CHEOPS Red Book, , 2013), the RMS noise is the addi-
tion of several contributions, but the final value mainly de-
pends on the stellar magnitude, the exposure time (linked to 
the stellar magnitude), and the integration time. Regardless 
of the exposure time, CHEOPS adds and downloads images 
every 60 seconds. This will be our integration time. Taking 
a look to Equation 8, we see that b instr is almost independent 
of ∆t, since σ 2 ∼ 1/∆t. Therefore, we will work only with 
one integration time: 60 sec. In Table 2 we show the instru-
mental RMS for three different stellar magnitudes (V=6, 9, 
and 12), with three corresponding exposure times (1, 10, 
and 60 sec., respectively). These values are our reference 
values. 

2.2.2. Granulation power spectrum density, P gran 

Following Campante et al. (2016), we use the model F 
of Kallinger et al. (2014) (with no mass dependence). 
Evaluating this model at ν max we have
