			<abstract>
				<p>Solar system, exoplanet and stellar science rely on transits, eclipses and occultations for dynamical and physical insight. Often, the geometry of these configurations are modelled by assuming a particular viewpoint. Here, instead, I derive user-friendly for-mulae from first principles independent of viewpoint and in three dimensions. I gen-eralise the results of Veras &amp; Breedt (2017) by (i) characterising three-body systems which are in transit but are not necessarily perfectly aligned, and by (ii) incorporating motion. For a given snapshot in time, I derive explicit criteria to determine whether a system is in or out of transit, if an eclipse is total or annular, and expressions for the size of the shadow, including their extreme values and a condition for engulfment. These results are exact. For orbital motion, I instead obtain approximate results. By assuming fixed orbits, I derive a single implicit algebraic relation which can be solved to obtain the frequency and duration of transit events-including ingresses and egresses-for combinations of moons, planets and stars on arbitrarily inclined circular orbits; the eccentric case requires the solution of Kepler&apos;s equation but remains algebraic. I prove that a transit shadow-whether umbral, antumbral or penumbral-takes the shape of a parabolic cylinder, and finally present geometric constraints on Earth-based observers hoping to detect a three-body syzygy (or perfect alignment)-either in extrasolar systems or within the solar system-potentially as a double annular eclipse.</p>

These varied situations all feature the same basic geometry, independent of viewpoint: the intersection of a radiation cone with spheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cayley 1870;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rigge 1924</ref>). Consequently, a thorough exploration of this geometry might reveal widely-applicable results.</p><p>Previous investigations of this architecture have targeted specific groups of observers. For Earth-bound viewers of solar system-based transit phenomena, the annual Astronomical Almanac <ref type="bibr">(USNO &amp; HMNAO 2018)</ref> provides ⋆ E-mail: d.veras@warwick.ac.uk † STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow detailed numerical data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ismail et al.

Ground-based observatories on Earth have also utilised stellar occultations to constrain minor planet shape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ortiz et al. 2017</ref>) and ring particle size (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Colwell et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mentel et al. 2018</ref>), but have difficulty distinguishing amongst grazing, partial and total eclipses in binary star systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Morris 1999</ref>). For the external observers of solar system planets, <ref type="bibr">Wells et al.

Exoplanet-based photometric transits include an extensive literature, with analytic treatments provided by</p><p>Schneider &amp; Chevreton</p><p>The motivation for this paper arises from the benefits of a fully analytic treatment of eclipses, transits and occultations. The first benefit is speed and convenience: although running multi-body numerical simulations can occasionally be faster than evaluations of analytic treatments which involve long series expansions or differential equations, no series expansions nor differential equations are given in this paper. Further, ready-to-use algebraic equations do not require the setup time and output processing involved when running multi-body simulations, particularly when objects are modelled as solid bodies and ray tracing would be required to compute, for example, the condition to be in or out of transit. The second benefit is a mathematical understanding of the results. For example, the maximum shadow size on a solid body does not occur at a necessarily obvious location. Also, a simple mathematical swap (shown later in the paper) allows one to derive results for partial eclipses just as easily as for total or annular eclipses. Without this <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The Glossary of the Astronomical Almanac ( <ref type="bibr">USNO &amp; HMNAO 2018</ref>) defines an eclipse as a "the occultation of a celestial body caused by its passage through the shadow cast by another body", a transit, in part, as "the passage of one celestial body in front of another of greater apparent diameter", an occultation as, in part, "the obscuration of one celestial body by another of greater apparent diameter", and a syzygy, as, in part, "a configuration where three or more celestial bodies are positioned approximately in a straight line in space".</p><p>knowledge, unnecessary effort might be expended in generating or modifying a numerical module to process partial eclipses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Plan for paper</head><p>Section 2 describes my basic setup. Sections 3-7 then explore what can be deduced from a snapshot in time, whereas Section 8 covers time evolution. Extensions are then presented in Sections 9-10 before the summary in Section 11.</p><p>In particular, for snapshots in time, in Section 3, I derive the equation of the intersection of a cone and a sphere. This equation, in combination with the properties of quadrics (or quadratic curves), is then used to deduce the shape of the shadow (Section 4) and the condition to be in or out of transit (Section 5). Section 6 establishes a criteria to determine whether the eclipse is annular or total, a direct extension of a similar result from Paper I. Section 7 then extends the geometry of Paper I in order to determine the size of this shadow in all cases.</p><p>I introduce time evolution in Section 8 and in both Appendices A and B, and consider transit durations and frequencies in three specific cases: (i) arbitrarily eccentric, coplanar orbits (Section 8.1), (ii) circular, arbitrarily inclined orbits (Section 8.2) and (iii) circular coplanar orbits (Section 8.3). For each case I provide three subcases: when the transit includes (i) one star and two planets, (ii) two stars and one planet, and (iii) one moon, one planet and one star.</p><p>Section 9 discusses how all of these results can be applied to penumbral shadows with relative ease. Section 10 then extends my off-syzygy results to four bodies in special cases where I do fix an observer.</p><p>Figures 1 and 2 provide a preview of the goals of the paper up through Section 8, and summarises how to reach them. These figures may be used as a convenient reference and algorithm (allowing the reader to skip the details) for computing eclipse-, transit-and occultation-related quantities in planetary and stellar systems. The figures also illustrate four different physical situations involving stars, planets and moons for which my results are applicable.</p><p>All notation and geometry is consistent with that of Paper I, and I have taken considerable care to avoid variable conflicts. Every variable in both papers is identified for easy access in Tables 1-4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">PHYSICAL AND GEOMETRICAL SETUP</head><p>Throughout the paper I model three-body systems. Only in Section 10 do I add a fourth body, and in a limited capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The three bodies: radii and distances</head><p>I consider all three bodies to be spheres, at least one of which is a star, denoted the "primary" and with a radius R1. The other two bodies (the "occulter", and the "target") are denoted respectively R2 and R3, with R1 &gt; R2 and R1 &gt; R3. However, there are no constraints on the relative sizes of the occulter and target.</p><p>The centre of the primary is taken to reside at the origin <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Procedure for obtaining results at snapshots in time. The four configurations shown are for two planets orbiting one star (1S2P), one planet orbiting two stars (1P2S), and one moon, one planet and one star with either the moon as the occulter (1M-MO) or the planet as the occulter (1M-PO). This flowchart demonstrates how one can determine with explicit expressions if three spherical bodies are in or out of transit, whether the eclipse is total or annular, whether the target is fully or partially engulfed in the shadow, and the size of the shadow. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Procedure for obtaining results for motion along static orbits. The four configurations shown are the same as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. This flowchart illustrates how to obtain the frequency, duration and start times of transits and ingresses/egresses given sets of orbital elements. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Potential configurations of three bodies in transit. The primary, which is always a star and the largest body, always forms a radiation cone with the occulter. If the target intersects this cone, then the target is said to be "in transit". If the near side of the target intersects the bottom nappe, the eclipse is total; otherwise, it is annular; the near side of the Earth, for example, lies coincidentally just at the vertex of the cone, which is why there are both annular and total solar eclipses. The entire target may or may not be completely engulfed in shadow. When not engulfed, as is the case for solar eclipses as seen on Earth, the target may be in ingress, egress or both, and the observability of the eclipse then depends on one's location on the target surface. The extension to the penumbral case -where a radiation cone is formed by internal tangent rays instead of external tangent rays -is covered in Section 9.</p><p>of an arbitrarily oriented orthogonal Cartesian {xyz} coordinate system. The radiation from the primary always forms an umbral and antumbral cone with the occulter, as in <ref type="figure">Fig.  3</ref>. Note that this cone has two nappes ( a nappe is one of the two sections of a double cone) and can move and change size during a transit. The target may be anywhere in space.</p><p>Only when the target intersects either or both nappes of the cone is a shadow formed. I refer to the side of the target facing the primary, where a shadow will be, as the "near side". The near side of the target could represent slightly more or slightly less than half of its total surface area (see e.g. equation A20 of Paper I). Whether the shadow results in a total or annular eclipse depends on which nappe contains the intersection of the target's near side (see Section 6).</p><p>At a given moment in time, I consider the target to be either fully engulfed inside of the cone, completely outside of the cone, or intersecting the cone. In this last case, if the surface of intersection occurs when the target is entering/leaving the cone, I denote those cases as ingress/egress. The target may be in both ingress and egress. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates many of the above possibilities.</p><p>Common examples can be visualised with the figure. For example, a total solar eclipse occurs when the Sun is the primary, the Moon is the occulter, the Earth is the target, and the Earth intersects the umbral cone. In this case, the Earth is usually is in both ingress and egress because of its relatively large size compared to the moon. Alternatively, an annular solar eclipse occurs when the Earth instead intersects the antumbral cone. For a lunar eclipse, the Earth becomes the occulter and the moon becomes the target.</p><p>Further, multiple planetary or stellar systems may be included: for example, an observer on Earth (the target) could see a distant star (the primary) being occulted by a Kuiper belt object (the occulter). For observing extrasolar planetary systems, one possibility is that the Earth is the target, the exoplanet is the occulter, and the exoplanet host star is the primary. Another possibility -when visualising what an extrasolar observer would see within, for example, a circumbinary system -is when the planet is the target, the smaller star is the occulter, and the larger star is the primary. For more examples, see Paper I.</p><p>The distance vector r always begins at the origin. Specific time-dependent distances are the distance between the centres of the primary and occulter r12(t) = {x12(t), y12(t), z12(t)}, the primary and target r13(t) = {x13(t), y13(t), z13(t)} and the occulter and target</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r23(t) = r13(t) − r12(t).</formula><p>(1) <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Visual representations of the intersection between the target and the radiation cone. The intersection is the meshed surface, and the shadow is the dark portion of that surface, which I prove is a parabolic cylinder in Section 4. The bottom four cartoons are from the same point of view, along the radiation cone axis, as the target gradually moves away from syzygy (left to right). These frames all demonstrate the case when the shadow does not engulf the target, much like in a solar eclipse; an observer would see the eclipse only by standing in the shadow. The true variation in the shadow size, however, can be obscured by adopting the fixed perspective here (see Section 7).</p><p>Henceforth, I will drop the denotation of the time dependence of these variables. As indicated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, for systems with two planets or stars, primarily r12 and r13 are used, whereas for systems with one moon, instead r13 and r23 are usually used.</p><p>Although the primary moves in time due to barycentric interactions, the origin of my coordinate system is always fixed on the primary's centre. Because of this barycentric motion, researchers often will define initial conditions in barycentric or Jacobi coordinates, particularly in circumbinary planetary systems. I denote the distance vector between the target and the barycentre of the primary and occulter as r123 with</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r13 = r123 + M1 M1 + M2 r12.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In this expression, the masses of the primary and occulter are denoted as M1 and M2. Finally, depending on the particular setup, one may reasonably adopt certain approximations. One example is when the target is somewhere in the Solar System and the primary is another stellar system. From Earth, one may observe either an exoplanetary transit or an occultation of a distant star across Saturn's rings. In the former case, one might assume r12 ≫ r13, r23, whereas in the latter case, one might assume r12, r13 ≫ r23. Regardless, I emphasise that in order to keep the analytical treatment as general as possible, no such approximations are made throughout the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Orbital elements</head><p>In Paper I, only the radii and mutual distances of the three bodies were needed to be given in order to obtain their results (see their <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>). The same is also true here for snapshots in time.</p><p>However, when I introduce motion, the number of initial parameters increases greatly: In that case, I also assume, in addition to all of the radii, a given set of the following orbital elements: {a, e, i, Ω, w, Π} for any two of the orbits. These elements are, respectively, semimajor axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination (i), longitude of ascending node (Ω), argument of pericentre (w), and true anomaly (Π). This set uniquely defines r through:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">r = a 1 − e 2 1 + e cos Π (3)</formula><p>which is independent of i, Ω, and w, and assumes that the orbit is an ellipse. However, the Cartesian components of r (which are x, y, and z) are individually dependent on i, Ω and w. Without loss of generality, I assume that the xaxis lies along the major axis of the ellipse, with the orbital pericentre being in the positive direction. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x = r [cos Ω cos (w + Π) − sin Ω sin (w + Π) cos i] ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">y = r [sin Ω cos (w + Π) + cos Ω sin (w + Π) cos i] ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">z = r [sin (w + Π) sin i] .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Because the systems in this paper all contain more than two bodies, mutual gravitational perturbations ensure that all of the orbital elements are time-dependent. Hence, the assumption of fixed orbits in this paper becomes weaker over longer timescales. I quantify the breakdown of this assumption for a few representative cases in Appendix B.</p><p>I will revisit motion along static orbits in Section 8. However, for now, I treat the snapshot case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPRESSION FOR THE SHADOW</head><p>A transiting system will produce an antumbral or umbral shadow on the target. This shadow is defined as the intersection of the near side of the target with the cone. <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref> provides a cartoon which illustrates the near side of the target in shadow (the dark meshed region) and the far side of the target in the intersection but not the shadow (the light meshed region).</p><p>In order to obtain the equation describing the shadow, I first need to characterise the cone and sphere. The general Cartesian equations of both a sphere and a cone have quadratic terms. Because both shapes are translated from the origin, and the cone is arbitrarily oriented, these movements will introduce cross terms in the equations. Therefore, I express all equations as quadrics, also known as quadratic curves. These quadrics, whose properties are described in Smith (1884), <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Coolidge (1968)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Zwillinger (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">McCrea (2006)</ref>, have the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Ax 2 + By 2 + Cz 2 + 2Dxy + 2Eyz + 2F xz +2Gx + 2Hy + 2Jz + K = 0.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>My immediate goal is to find expressions of the coefficients (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K) in terms Critical value of k for which target is entirely in the field of view of observer on fourth body equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(160)</ref> k Critical value of k for which occulter is entirely in the field of view of observer on fourth body equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(163)</ref> k• Critical value of k to produce a double annular eclipse for observer on fourth body equations (165-168) l</p><p>Auxiliary variable equations <ref type="bibr">(165)</ref><ref type="bibr">(166)</ref><ref type="bibr">(167)</ref><ref type="bibr">(168)</ref><ref type="bibr">(169)</ref> n Distance between base of umbral cone and centre of primary equation (13) p</p><p>Transit number equations <ref type="bibr">(146)</ref><ref type="bibr">(147)</ref> r 12</p><p>Distance vector between centres of primary and occulter equations (1-2)</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r 13</formula><p>Distance vector between centres of primary and target equations (1-2) r <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Distance vector between centres of occulter and target equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> r <ref type="bibr">123</ref> Distance vector between centre of target and barycentre of primary and occulter equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> r 14</p><p>Distance vector between centres of primary and external body when the primary, occulter and target are in syzygy Section 10 only r †</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">TOTAL VS. ANNULAR ECLIPSE CRITERION</head><p>In the last section, I determined the conditions necessary for a transit to exist. Supposing it does, now I determine whether the transit produces a total or annular eclipse. This exercise involves determining which nappe intersects the near side of the target at a given moment in time. In rare cases, throughout a transit, the target's near side could at different times intersect both nappes, yielding a mixed or hybrid eclipse (here I consider just a snapshot in time). For perspective, the criterion for an annular eclipse to occur at syzygy (equation A7 of Paper I) is r13 h+n+R3, which was derived by placing the target just above the cone's vertex at syzygy. The criterion for a total eclipse to occur was obtained simply by switching the sign.</p><p>Here, in the off-syzygy cases, there is a subtle difference. The same criterion for an annular eclipse still holds, but is sufficient, not necessary. For a total eclipse to occur, a sufficient but not necessary condition is r13 &lt; h+n, because I consider only the near side of the target. Otherwise, when h + n &lt; r13 &lt; h + n + R3, the type of eclipse depends on ψ. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 7</ref> illustrates both possibilities: when |ψ| &gt; |ψ ♦ |, the eclipse is annular. Overall then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_68">r13 h + n + R3, annular h + n &lt; r13 &lt; h + n + R3 &amp; |ψ| |ψ ♦ | , annular h + n &lt; r13 &lt; h + n + R3 &amp; |ψ| &lt; |ψ ♦ | , total r13 h + n, total.<label>(69)</label></formula><p>I emphasise that this criterion applies only when the system is in transit in the first place (equation 57). In <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5, I</ref> summarise some important criteria so far listed. At syzygy, ψ = 0, and hence |ψ| &lt; |ψ ♦ | is always true.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">TIME VARIATION</head><p>In Sections 3-7, I have characterised transits at specific snapshots in time. Now, I remove that restriction, and consider the evolution of bodies moving along fixed orbits, as described in Section 2.2. This assumption removes the threebody considerations of stability and transit timing variations, which have both become substantial research fields by themselves; in Appendix B I quantify the goodness of this approximation for a few cases. Nevertheless, as shown below, even the assumption of fixed orbits is not sufficiently simple to provide explicit analytical results in nearly all cases. I assume that the masses and radii of the primary, occulter and target are all known, as well as some of their orbital parameters, depending on the specific case considered. Table 6 provides a list of the orbital parameters assumed for each case.</p><p>My goal is to determine eclipse frequencies and durations for various geometries. My procedure is to (i) find (x12, y12, z12, x13, y13, z13) in terms of the given orbital elements <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 6</ref>) and time (equations 1-6), (ii) then compute ψ(t) from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(56)</ref>, and (iii) finally compare ψ(t) to ψ (t) (equation 57) and ψ ♦ (t) (equation 60). The complexity of the time dependence determines the ability to carry out these tasks. The first task is completed in Appendix A, and the second task is completed in this section. The third task yields an explicit solution only in a special case, which is also presented in this section.</p><p>I perform these tasks in 12 different scenarios split according to whether the orbits are arbitrarily eccentric and coplanar (Section 8.1), circular and arbitrarily inclined (Section 8.2), or circular and coplanar (Section 8.3). Each of these scenarios are respectively denoted by the superscripts of (e), (i) and (cc).</p><p>I split each of these subsections into four cases of interest. These cases are: (a) One Star, Two Planets (1S2P) 3 , (b) Two Stars, One Planet (2S1P) -where the planet is assumed to be a circumbinary planet -(c) One Star, One Planet, One Moon -Moon occulter (1M-MO), and (d) One Star, One Planet, One Moon -Planet occulter (1M-PO). I will use these abbreviations throughout the section for clarity. This split is useful because each of these scenarios typically utilise different initial conditions, as described in Section 2.1 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>These scenarios also represent known or suspected planetary systems. The 1S2P case is particularly common. In fact, roughly 500 known planets reside in 1S2P systems (from the Exoplanet Orbit Database, at exoplanets.org, as of October 2018). A couple dozen planets reside in 2S1P systems, including, for example, PSR B1620-26, which features a planet orbiting both a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sigurdsson 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Thorsett et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sigurdsson et al. 2003</ref>), and Kepler-16, which features a planet orbiting both a K-type star and an M-type star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Doyle et al. 2011</ref>). The 1M-MO and 1M-PO cases can be represented, for example, by the Sun, Earth and Moon, when neglecting everything else in the solar system.

The result is that the comparison of ψ to ψ and ψ ♦ are treated differently in the three subsections below:</p><p>• For eccentric and coplanar orbits (Section 8.2), ψ, ψ and ψ ♦ are all functions of true anomaly, and hence comparisons at each moment in time throughout the orbits require an implicit solution for time through Kepler's equation;</p><p>• For inclined and circular orbits (Section 8.3), Π = M = n (t − τ ). Therefore, ψ and ψ ♦ are no longer functions of true anomaly and instead are explicit functions of time (through δ and Kint), and ψ is a different explicit function of time, depending on architecture. Hence Kepler's equation need not be solved, and the resulting relations require just a single implicit solution for time.</p><p>• For circular and coplanar orbits (Section 8.4), Π = M = n (t − τ ), and the situation is the same for inclined, circular orbits with one exception: For the 2P1S case, ψ and ψ ♦ are constants, enabling explicit solutions for time. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> If all of the masses are not known, then one may neglect M orbiter in the computation of n with a corresponding loss of accuracy.</p></div>

However, another type of eclipse -a partial eclipse -always accompanies a total or annular eclipse. A partial eclipse is formed through the internal tangent lines (as opposed to the external tangent lines) between the primary and occulter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 19</ref>, which is reproduced from <ref type="figure">figure  2</ref> of Paper I). The geometry of partial eclipses is akin to that of annular eclipses because the target intersects the upper nappe of the radiation cone. The similarities between these two types of eclipses of syzygy were highlighted in Appendix B of Paper I. There it was revealed that several of the quantities for the penumbral cone could be reproduced by replacing R2 with −R2 in the corresponding antumbral cone.</p><p>I use this symmetry here to great effect. Rather than rework all of the results so far with this different cone, all I need to do is define</p><formula xml:id="formula_149">∆ ≡ R1 + R2 r12 ,<label>(151)</label></formula><p>and then replace δ with ∆ in all of the relevant equations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">SUMMARY</head><p>I have derived user-friendly algebraic relations and criteria for eclipses, transits and occultations, having been inspired by the foundational geometry of <ref type="bibr">Veras &amp; Breedt (2017)</ref>. These relations may be useful for a variety of purposes for transit identification, in the planning and analysis of observations, and for an understanding of the shadowing conditions on the surfaces and atmospheres of planets and moons; Figs. 1 and 2 contain flowcharts for quick use. Because nearly all formulae are independent of perspective, they may be applied to Earth-based observatories, Solar system-based observatories (on land and in space), and observatories within extrasolar systems.</p><p>My focus was on three-body systems which include one star, one planet, and one other body which could be a star, planet or moon. The only major assumptions I made about these bodies were that they are all spheres, that light rays do not bend, and for orbital motion cases, that the orbits are fixed. I considered both snapshots of these systems (Sections 3-7) and their motion (Section 8, and Appendices A and B) in the context of umbral, antumbral and penumbral (Section 9) shadows. I also illustrated how some of these results may be extended to four bodies, with an observer situated on the fourth external body, such as the Earth (Section 10).</p><p>For snapshots in time, specific results include (i) A criterion to determine if a given system architecture is in or out of transit (equation 57),</p><p>(ii) If in transit, whether the target will be fully engulfed in the shadow (equation 60),</p><p>(iii) Whether a specific location on the target is in transit (equation 66), (iv) Whether or not the shadow is umbral or antumbral (equation 69); a penumbral shadow will always accompany both, (v) The size of the umbral shadow (equation 110) or antumbral shadow (equation 111), (vi) The minimum shadow size (equations 95-96) and maximum shadow size (equations 97-98), and (vii) A transformation (from equation 14 to equation 151) which enables one to obtain snapshot results for penumbral cones without having to perform derivations similar to those carried out for the umbral and antumbral cones.</p><p>Of more mathematical interest is (viii) That the shadow is always a parabolic cylinder (Section 4), (ix) The equation of the intersection of the radiation cone and spherical target in Cartesian coordinates (equations 27-37) and in radial coordinates (equation 40), and (x) The transformed version of this equation in standard form (equation 41).</p><p>For time evolution, specific results include (i) Start times, end times, durations and frequencies of transits (including ingresses and egresses) for two planets on circular coplanar orbits around a star (equations 146-150),</p><p>(ii) The angles ψ which allow for a single implicit computation of start times, end times, durations and frequencies of transits for circular arbitrarily inclined orbits (equations 134-139), and (iii) The angles ψ which allow for implicit computation of transit properties for arbitrarily eccentric, coplanar orbits (equations 115-120).</p><p>For the special extended case of an observer of an exosyzygy, specific results include (i) The critical distance beyond which the target, rather than the occulter, blocks the primary's starlight (equation 154),</p><p>(ii) The maximum allowable transverse distance of the observer (perpendicular to the syzygy; equations 157-158),</p><p>(iii) The angular diameters in the sky of the shadows on the primary (equations 155 and 164), and (iv) The transverse distance of an observer who is able to see a double annular eclipse (equations 165-170). <ref type="bibr">Veras, D., &amp; Breedt, E. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, MNRAS, 468, 2672</ref><ref type="bibr">Wells, R., Poppenhaeger, K., Watson, C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX B: GOODNESS OF STATIC ORBIT APPROXIMATION</head><p>When deriving relations for orbital motion in Section 8, I assumed that the bodies move along static orbits. In reality, mutual three-body gravitational effects perturb these orbits, as well as altering the speed of the bodies which traverse these orbits. Hence, the applicability of my relations for motion depend on (i) the architecture considered, (ii) the accuracy sought, and (iii) the timescale over which the results are to be generated. In this appendix, I provide some quantitative context for this applicability. I compute the extent of the departure between the static and perturbed cases for just a few representative architectures. I do so by performing multibody numerical simulations with point-mass bodies. Their outcomes generate (x, y, z) locations of an object at a series of times, and I calculate the distance from these locations to the locations analytically obtained from the formulae in Section 8 and Appendix A at those same times. This timedependent distance is henceforth denoted as deviation. The maximum deviation would then represent approximately the longest axis of the initial orbit.</p><p>For my numerical simulations, I used the Bulirsch-Stoer integrator from the Mercury integration package <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chambers 1999</ref>) with an accuracy tolerance of 10 −12 . This integrator utilises a variable timestep and so is adaptable to all of the architectures considered here, but does suffer from floating point round-off error. Throughout I adopted 1M⊙ stars and set the output time interval to be at most a few per cent of the orbital period of the smallest orbit, but not small enough to resolve variations during an individual transit. I ran the simulations for no longer than a few human lifetimes, but sufficiently long enough to sample tens, hundreds or thousands of transits depending on architecture. I started with the orbital elements in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> and subsequently converted them into Cartesian elements for input into the code.</p><p>For consistency, the numerical constants which I inserted into the analytics needed to be equivalent to those in the code. Hence, I adopted Mercury's now slightly-outdated value for the astronomical unit (149597870000 m), its value for Solar mass (1.9891 × 10 30 kg), its definition of year (365.25 days) and its value for G -obtained through the code representation of K2 -of 6.67198422296 × 10 −11 N·kg −2 ·m 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B1 The 1S2P case</head><p>Two planets orbiting one star may be subject to a variety of secular and mean motion resonances. These resonances are encountered at particular planet separations and orbital angles. Generally, however, the larger the initial separation, the smaller the magnitude of the perturbation, particularly on timescales of tens or hundreds of orbits.</p><p>I present deviations for a variety of two-planet, onestar, circular, coplanar (cc) case instances in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">Fig. B1</ref>. The curves in the figure are not solid lines, but rather contain oscillations at different scales and so appear fuzzy. In all instances, the inner planet was initially located at 1 au and the two planets were of equal mass. The gray curve (third from top) represents a type of fiducial case for close orbits, with M2 = M3 = 10 −6 M1 and a13/a12 = 2 (initially). The red curves then keep this same initial semimajor axis ratio but sample different masses: M2 = M3 = 10 −4 M1 (top curve), M2 = M3 = 10 −8 M1 (third from bottom curve), and M2 = M3 = 10 −10 M1 (bottom curve). The blue curves keep M2 = M3 = 10 −6 M1 but vary the initial mutual separations as a13/a12 = 1.5 (second from top curve), 3 (fourth from top curve), 5 (fourth from bottom curve) and 10 (second from bottom curve).</p><p>These curves do not sample the entire range of known separations. For example, the semimajor axis ratio of Neptune and Mercury is about 78. On the lower end, semimajor axis ratios much smaller than 1.5 are subject to dynamical instabilities depending on the planet masses and other orbital parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B2 The 2S1P case</head><p>2S1P architectures are more prone to the effects of precession than in the 1S2P case. For eccentric and/or inclined orbits, both stars can quickly precess the outer orbit's argument of pericentre and quickly regress the outer orbit's longitude of ascending node. Even in the circular, coplanar case, there will be short-term variations of the osculating elements, and in a more pronounced way than in the 1S2P circular coplanar case. Quick orbital changes explain why circumbinary exoplanets like Kepler-413 ABb disappeared and re-appeared during the original Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kostov et al. 2014</ref>). initial inner binary semimajor axis of a12 = 0.2 au. Both orbits were initially circular, and in all cases i12 = 0 • , Ω12 = Ω123 = 0 • . The outer orbit initial semimajor axis and inclination for the curves, from top to bottom, were respectively, (a123 = 1 au, i123 = 0 • for gray), (a123 = 1 au, i123 = 1 • for blue), (a123 = 2 au, i123 = 1 • for red), (a123 = 5 au, i123 = 1 • for brown), and (a123 = 5 au, i123 = 50 • for black). The bottom plot is a zoom-in of the top plot for the first 30 binary eclipses. The blue and gray curves are nearly coincident, except for the trough or kink in the top plot.</p><p>The initially 1 au planet achieved a maximum deviation after about 400 initial binary orbits, and then repeated this behaviour in a cyclical pattern. Alternatively, the initially 2 au planet did not reach maximum deviation until after 1600 initial binary orbits, demonstrating a strong dependence of deviation on a123. In contrast, the dependence on inclination is relatively weak, as shown by the blue, brown, gray and black curves. The differences in deviation are easily discernable between the i123 = 1 • and i123 = 50 • cases, at least after several tens of binary orbits. The difference in deviation between the i123 = 0 • and i123 = 1 • cases, however, is discernable only at the kink. This kink represents the location where the orbit has precessed through a complete revolution, such that the deviation returns close to zero for a relatively short time. The deviation stretches closer to zero in the coplanar case (gray curve) than in the inclined case (blue curve). The inclination differences ultimately indicate that the orbital changes cannot be dominated by nodal precession.</p><p>These dependencies have been well-studied analytically in the limiting cases of M3 = 0 and for averaged, or secular, orbits. In these limits, perturbation theory can be used to approximate the time evolution of Ω123 as a series (see <ref type="bibr">Eq. 208 of Veras 2014</ref>), the leading term of which is similar to leading term of the time evolution of w123 (see <ref type="bibr">Eq. 212 of Veras 2014</ref>). An alternate expression for this leading term, expressed as a precession timescale, can be found in Eq. 15 of Martin (2017a), having originated from the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schneider (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Farago &amp; Laskar (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Doolin &amp; Blundell (2011)</ref>.</p><p>The availability of analytic approximations for secular precession timescales, combined with the periodic behaviour of the curves in <ref type="figure">Fig. B2</ref> (apparent in the top two curves of the top plot only), potentially allows one to provide a correction term to the analytical treatment in this paper. Doing so may reduce deviations, particularly for the planets with the smallest orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B3 The 1M-MO case</head><p>A moon with a planet host which is close to its parent star might be subject to similarly fast orbit precession (see <ref type="bibr">Eq. 3 of Martin 2017b, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mardling 2010)</ref>, leading to large deviations on short timescales. In order to explore this possibility within the context of my 1M-MO case, I considered a (giant) planet with mass M3 = 10 −3 M⊙ which hosts a moon of mass M2 = 10 −8 M⊙ on an inclined circular orbit with respect to i23 = 0 • . I chose a large initial satellite distance of a23 = 10 6 km in order to test an extreme-case scenario of least accuracy. This distance still however lies within the Hill sphere of all sampled semimajor axes (described below), meaning that the moon orbits the planet and not the star. On the other extreme, a moon like Phobos resides just 6000 km from Mars, with resulting deviations which may be significantly lower (see Eq. 3 of Martin 2017b). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">Figure B3</ref> illustrates the results with three pairs of curves. The three pairs from top to bottom correspond to initial values of a13 = 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 au. The blue curves illustrate the case of an initial value of i13 = 1 • whereas the red curves showcase an initial value of i13 = 50 • . The deviations again illustrate a weak dependence on inclination and a stronger dependence on a13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B4 Regions of validity</head><p>The plots in this Appendix suggest that the static orbit approximation cannot be used on timescales at or beyond which a curve reaches unity, unless correction terms are applied. Consider the top (blue) curve in <ref type="figure">Fig. B2</ref>, which reaches unity after about 400 binary orbits. Although this case is representative of most currently known circumbinary exoplanets, as more distant exoplanets are discovered orbiting two stars, the fixed-orbit approximation will become more useful.</p><p>Up until what time is the static orbit approximation then applicable? The answer depends on the user's motivation, the accuracy they seek, the deviation of the other bodies in the system, and how all deviations are broken down into (x, y, z) components. For example, for those wishing to compute a single transit duration -which is a small fraction of one orbit-the resulting accuracy can vary by at least eight orders of magnitude depending on which of the small sample of architectures considered here is chosen.</p><p>In general, however, some trends have emerged. The static orbit approximation is better suited to the 1S2P case than the 2S1P and 1M-MO cases. Also, distant transits tend to reduce deviations. More precisely, large mutual separations of three bodies will improve the static orbit approximation. Overall, the static orbit approximation is better used to approximate transit durations and frequencies rather than predict actual instances of eclipses for sufficiently massive objects residing within about 10 au of their parent star or stars.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>When expressed as a quadric, this surface gives Atar = Btar = Ctar = 1, Dtar = Etar = Ftar = 0, Gtar = −x13, Htar = −y13, Jtar = −z13 and Ktar = r 2 13 − R 2 3</figDesc></figure>

The negative values would correspond to the target intersecting the cone &quot;behind&quot; the primary, as the cone extends infinitely in both directions. In exoplanetary science, this intersection would be referred to as a secondary transit. An analytical treatment of secondary transits may be carried out by proceeding with the analysis in this section by assuming cos κ &lt; 0. This analysis may eventuc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-32</note>
