			<abstract>
				<p>Most future surveys designed to discover transiting exoplanets, including TESS and PLATO, will target bright (V 13) and nearby solar-type stars having a spectral type later than F5. In order to enhance the probability of identifying transits, these surveys must cover a very large area on the sky, because of the intrinsically low areal density of bright targets. Unfortunately, no existing catalog of stellar parameters is both deep and wide enough to provide a homogeneous input list. As the first Gaia data release exploitable for this purpose is expected to be released not earlier than late 2017, we have devised an improved reduced-proper-motion method to discriminate late field dwarfs and giants by combining UCAC4 proper motions with APASS DR6 photometry, and relying on RAVE DR4 as an external calibrator. The output, named UCAC4-RPM, is a publicly-available, complete all-sky catalog of solar-type dwarfs down to V 13.5, plus an extension to log g &gt; 3.0 subgiants. The relatively low amount of contamination (defined as the fraction of false positives; &lt; 30%) also makes UCAC4-RPM a useful tool for the past and ongoing ground-based transit surveys, which need to discard candidate signals originating from early-type or giant stars. As an application, we show how UCAC4-RPM may support the preparation of the TESS (that will map almost the entire sky) input catalog and the input catalog of PLATO, planned to survey more than half of the whole sky with exquisite photometric precision.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Although a couple of thousand exoplanets have been discovered, the general picture on their structure, formation and E-mail: valerio.nascimbeni@unipd.it evolution is still far from being complete. Putting things in context requires a more detailed analysis of individual systems than is currently achievable. This includes, for instance, the estimate of accurate stellar masses and ages through asteroseismology and a detailed characterization of the planetary atmospheres through spectroscopy. Both these tasks require high S/N, and are feasible only when targeting planets hosted by nearby and bright stars, which have been very rare indeed so far. In the next years, two cornerstone, spacebased missions that will photometrically detect and partially characterize planetary systems around bright stars will be launched: TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>), a NASA Explorer mission selected for launch in <ref type="bibr">2017</ref><ref type="bibr">-2018</ref><ref type="bibr">and PLATO (Rauer et al. 2014</ref>), a medium-class mission selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity <ref type="bibr">(2022)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2023)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2024)</ref>.</p><p>Aside from being bright (V 13), the most promising targets for exoplanetary science are solar-type stars, i. e., main-sequence stars later than spectral type F5, which could include moderately-evolved subgiants following a broader definition. As a magnitude-limited sample of field stars is dominated by distant (and intrinsically bright) giants and early-type stars, the only way to access a large sample of bright, nearby solar-type stars (as required by transit exoplanet search surveys) is to dramatically increase the covered sky area up to a significant fraction of the whole celestial sphere. In this case, the selection of a homogeneous target list requires the deepest all-sky stellar classification ever attempted, able to assign at least a spectral type and luminosity class to every star brighter than V = 13. This should be regarded as a minimal requirement for carrying out the target selection task. Previous experience from the CoRoT and Kepler space missions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deleuil et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) has shown that detailed knowledge of the stellar parameters of the targets (such as effective temperature T eff , surface gravity log g, metallicity [M/H], stellar mass and radius R, M, age, etc.) along with the identification and characterization of the background stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deleuil et al. 2006</ref>) helps to prioritize the targets, and makes the follow-up and the rejection of false alarms much more efficient.</p><p>The Gaia mission <ref type="bibr">1 (Perryman et al. 2001</ref>), launched in 2013 and currently collecting data, is expected to play a fundamental role in the target selection by performing an unprecedented ultra-high-precision astrometric survey of nearly every source brighter than V 20, along with lowresolution spectrophotometry and radial velocities. An intermediate catalog which includes stellar parameters from spectrophotometry is expected to be released at the end of 2017 2 . However, we should keep in mind that i) the Gaia stellar classification will be affected by crowding in the densest fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bailer-Jones et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Recio-Blanco et al. 2016)</ref>; ii) there will be some degeneracy among certain parameters, such as temperature and interstellar extinction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Straižys et al. 2006</ref>; Bailer-Jones 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bailer-Jones et al. 2013</ref>); iii) other astronomical catalogs (for instance, X/UV/IR/narrow-band photometry and activity diagnostics) will be very complementary to the Gaia measurements; iv) space missions (e.g. TESS) and ground-based surveys which are presently in development may require a preliminary target list before 2017, for the performance analysis, to optimize the observing strategy, to fine-tune the spacecraft design, and to begin implementing the foreseen additional observations and coordinated follow-up programs.</p><p>In this paper, we first introduce the basic problem of attempting a large-scale stellar classification by relying only 1 http://sci.esa.int/gaia/ 2 http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/release on wide-band photometry and proper motions (Section 2), and review the existing techniques and catalogs designed for that purpose (Section 3). After showing that a new approach has to be devised, in Section 4 we describe how we compiled a brand-new all-sky catalog of FGK dwarfs and subgiants, called UCAC4-RPM. We include a detailed description of the catalogs used as input, the grid-based algorithm exploited to define appropriate selection criteria, and the cross-matching procedure used to estimate the contamination and completeness of the resulting sample. Finally, in Sections 5 and 6 we discuss how UCAC4-RPM can be exploited by the ongoing or forthcoming space-and groundbased transit surveys, and how it could be extended and complemented in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE BASIC PROBLEM</head><p>The most reliable stellar classification is provided by spectra and trigonometric parallaxes from which it is possible to extract the basic parameters of the stellar atmosphere (T eff , log g, [M/H]) and its distance and absolute magnitude in a relatively straightforward way. Once these parameters are known, we can use stellar evolutionary models to derive other important physical quantities such as the radius R, the mass M, and the age of the star. Spectroscopy and high-precision astrometry are time-consuming. Alternative approaches, based on narrow-band photometry <ref type="bibr">( ´ Arnadóttir et al. 2010</ref>) are more suited to wide-field surveys (at a price of lower accuracy), but they are still too costly in terms of observing time.</p><p>Until Gaia releases accurate parallaxes, it is not feasible to characterize hundreds of thousands of stars on an extremely large field of view with the techniques mentioned above. The only available, accurate all-sky classifications of this kind are limited to sources at V 8 or even brighter, based on spectroscopic surveys (HD, MK classifications; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Morgan &amp; Keenan 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Skiff 2014</ref>), narrow-band surveys <ref type="bibr">(Geneva-Copenhagen;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nordström et al. 2004</ref>) or the space-based Hipparcos catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Perryman &amp; ESA 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Leeuwen 2007)</ref>. At the present time, we must rely on the only available catalogs that reach the V 13 limit: wide-band photometric catalogs (both in the visible and in the nearinfrared) and ground-based astrometric catalogs, which are accurate enough to provide good proper motions, but not trigonometric parallaxes. In what follows we present the difficulties and limitations of exploiting these sub-optimal data for stellar classification purposes.</p><p>For a detailed review of the main standard photometric systems, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bessell (2005)</ref>. A summary of calibrated broadband colors and physical properties of typical main sequence, solar-metallicity dwarfs is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 15</ref>.7-15.8 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cox (2000)</ref>. A revised and constantly updated version of that table is maintained by E. Mamajek 3 (Pecaut &amp; Mamajek 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Wide-band photometry</head><p>Using wide-band photometry to derive stellar parameters is a challenging task for many reasons. First of all, over most of the visible spectrum, the expected differences in color between cool stars of similar T eff and spectral type (SpT), but different surface gravity log g and metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, are at most a few tenths of a mag, even when exploiting customdesigned narrow-or intermediate-band filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zdanavičius 2005</ref>, see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c-1f)</ref>. When the spectral energy distribution of those stars is integrated over the wavelength ranges of a typical wide-band photometric system (∆λ ≈ 1000Å1000Å) the differences fade to only a few hundredths of mag. A notable exception is in the spectral region bluer than the "Balmer jump", which is sampled by both the Johnson U and the SDSS u filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zdanavičius 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zdanavičius , 2005</ref>). Unluckily, these magnitudes are the most difficult to measure and calibrate from the ground, due to atmospheric effects, standardization issues and low instrumental sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bessell 2005)</ref>. So far, no all-sky, deep catalog of U /u magnitudes is available.</p><p>Even more importantly, wide-band photometric classifications are known to be highly degenerate on some stellar parameters, such as metallicity and gravity; see for instance the example reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Belikov &amp; Röser (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> of this paper. By using a B, V , J two-color diagram, it is not possible to discriminate between metal-poor dwarfs and solar-metallicity giants, both of G spectral type. F, G and K stars are expected to dominate a magnitude-limited sample at V &lt; 13, and they are located in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and color-color diagram region where most degeneracy occurs. A further source of degeneracy is interstellar reddening, which is not negligible in a magnitudelimited sample of stars at low and intermediate Galactic latitudes. In particular, E(B − V ) (or AV ) and T eff are degenerate: a distant, hot star can be easily misclassified as a closer and cooler star. To a lesser extent, this also holds for near-infrared (NIR) photometry, and even when parallaxes and low-resolution spectra are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bailer-Jones 2010</ref>.</p><p>The most basic aim of an input catalog for transit surveys is to distinguish dwarfs from giants for the spectral types ranging from mid-F stars down to the late M ones. The most relevant spectral regions are therefore those sensitive to log g. Aside from the optical ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, the most prominent features are located on the continuum at 4000-4500Å4500Å ("G band"; mostly for the F-G spectral types) and at the MgI triplet/MgH absorption feature at 5150-5200Å5200Å (mostly for G-K spectral types, as demonstrated also by Teig 2008). Most narrow-and intermediateband photometric systems developed for stellar classification purposes, as well as the G red and DDO51 filters originally designed for the Kepler Input Catalog survey (KIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Batalha et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) are tailored on these spectral features.</p><p>As for wide-band photometry, we note that the three above-mentioned features fall roughly inside the Johnson U , B, V bands, though their contribution is greatly diluted by the bandwidth effect, and it never exceeds a few hundredths of magnitude on the B − V color. Cousins Rc and Ic bands are relatively insensitive to log g, except for the spectral class M. Results from synthetic photometry applied to M dwarfs should be approached with caution, as the theoretical uncertainties of their atmospheric opacities result in large differences between calculated and observed SEDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Zdanavičius 2005)</ref>. NIR wide-band photometry, that is carried out in the JHK or JHKs bands by ground-based surveys (such as 2MASS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>), is particularly effective in discriminating gravity effects on very late spectral types. H − K or H − Ks colors, for instance, can differ by a few tenths of mag between M dwarfs and M giants <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lépine &amp; Shara 2005</ref>). This technique can be extended to late K stars. However, NIR color effects become smaller and very degenerate for earlier types such as F and G. On the other hand, NIR colors are less affected by interstellar extinction, and they can be advantageous on fields at low Galactic latitudes, where reddening effects are not negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Proper motions</head><p>Proper motions, which are provided with a typical accuracy of a few mas/yr by existing catalogs such as those from the Tycho-2 ( <ref type="bibr">Høg et al. 2000</ref>) and UCAC4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zacharias et al. 2013</ref>) surveys, proved to be helpful in discriminating dwarfs from giants when combined with photometric colors. The so-called Reduced Proper Motion technique (RPM) exploits a combination of proper motions µα, µ δ and apparent magnitude m as a statistical proxy to the target distance. By crudely assuming that all field stars share the same absolute velocity pointed towards a random direction on the sphere, one concludes that the quantity</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">RPM(m) = m − 5 + 5 log (µα cos δ) 2 + µ 2 δ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>called reduced proper motion is statistically approximating the absolute magnitude of the stars plus a constant offset 4 . RPM diagrams (RPMD) are therefore similar to CMDs smeared along the vertical axis, and, as such, can be exploited to select specific types of stars. RPMs are very effective in selecting main-sequence dwarfs among bright (V ≤ 11) stars belonging to late spectral types (K-M), as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould &amp; Morgan (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gontcharov (2009)</ref>, among others. On fainter stars, and for F and G spectral types, the RPM technique is less effective, and a larger fraction of false positives is expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gould &amp; Morgan 2003)</ref>. RPMs, by themselves, cannot provide stellar parameters other than a very rough estimate of the absolute magnitude or SpT. In addition, selection cuts based on proper motions have to be devised with care, as the resulting sample could be biased in subtle ways toward thick disk or halo targets, which share a higher intrinsic velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lépine &amp; Shara 2005</ref>) and different metallicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PREVIOUS CLASSIFICATION ATTEMPTS</head><p>Beginning in the 2000s, with the advent of accurate all-sky catalogs such as Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and 2MASS, some authors have tried to extract stellar parameters using only wide-band photometry and proper motions. Some were driven by the need to extract a target list for exoplanet searches (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammons et al. 2006</ref> for the NHK radial velocity survey, Gould &amp; Morgan 2003 for generic transit surveys). Others were trying to provide an all-sky calibration for the ugriz passbands <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ofek, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pickles &amp; Depagne, 2010)</ref>, to develop a general method to classify Galactic stellar populations ( <ref type="bibr">Bilir et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Belikov &amp; R ˜ A˝ user, 2008)</ref>, or to distinguish particular classes of stars, such as M dwarfs from M giants <ref type="bibr">(Lepine &amp; Shara 2005</ref>). Most of these works exploit the same input catalogs with different algorithms. Usually they are based on Tycho-2 BT , VT and 2MASS JHKs magnitudes, as they provide uniform, precise all-sky photometry over pass bands that contain useful information on [M/H] and log g (See Section 2). Proper motions, when needed, are also extracted from Tycho-2. Unfortunately, most photometric classifications are limited to about V ≤ 11 by the completeness limit of Tycho-2. While 2MASS provides very good photometry (σ &lt; 0.05 mag) down to V ∼ 15 and Tycho-2 proper motions are also well complemented by the UCAC survey for stars brighter than V ∼ 15, no reliable source of visual magnitudes was available for V ≥ 11 on the whole sky until recently. In what follows we shortly review a few previous classification attempts which are most relevant to our purposes.</p></div>

A best-fit template was then assigned to each star, and a set of SDSS griz synthetic magnitudes was calculated for each template to construct an all-sky catalog of griz magnitudes for calibration purposes. Though not specifically designed to derive stellar parameters, this work yielded spectral types and luminosity classes for ∼1.56 millions Tycho-2 entries. On a subset range of spectral types, metal rich vs. metal poor stars are also differentiated. For unknown reasons, stars hav-</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ing δ 4 • , 54 • ≤ δ ≤ 59 • , δ ≥ 80 • are lacking.</formula><p>Pickles &amp; Depagne (2010) extended the work done by Ofek by fitting updated spectral templates on a larger set of stellar magnitudes, having complemented the Tycho/2MASS BT VT JHKs with the photographic RN magnitudes from USNO-B1.0 (through the NOMAD catalog, compiled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Zacharias et al. 2005</ref>). Cuts were performed on 2MASS J − H, H − Ks colors and Tycho-2 proper motions, attempting to distinguish giants from dwarfs when the spectral template χ 2 -fitting is unable to do it. For our purposes, both the Ofek (2008) and <ref type="bibr">Pickles &amp; Depagne (2010)</ref> classifications should be handled with caution. Interstellar reddening is not accounted for, and this is known to let many distant, hot giants to be misclassified as cool dwarfs. If one only selects V &lt; 11, SpT &gt; F5 stars, the resulting sample is strongly concentrated towards the Galactic disk, and this is even more striking when selecting only K and M dwarfs, which, at bright magnitudes, should be isotropically distributed on the sky. Moreover, K and M stars dominate the sample along the Galactic plane, while A, F and G stars are expected to do so in a magnitude-limited sample. Summarizing, the classification algorithms above are not to be trusted when working at low Galactic latitudes (b &lt; 20 • ).</p><p>A more complex approach to template-matching stellar classification is that attempted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Belikov &amp; Röser (2008)</ref>, who defined a set of custom extinction-free indexes Q123 calibrated on the Tycho-2/2MASS photometric systems (BT VT JHKs). An interval-cluster analysis was then applied to extract T eff , log g, [M/H] by fitting Kurucz models to Q on the whole Tycho-2/2MASS set, after the algorithm has been trained on a subset having known spectroscopic parameters. Adopting Q indexes also allowed the authors to constrain the extinction AV . As a result, bright, nearby dwarfs are homogeneously distributed, except for a few sky regions where very high or anomalous extinction occurs (e. g., the Ophiucus cloud or at very low b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Proper-motion-based techniques</head><p>The RPM approach, introduced in Section 2.2, was first pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kapteyn &amp; van Rhijn (1920)</ref> and Hertzsprung <ref type="bibr">(1922)</ref>, and applied for the first time to the Tycho-2 catalog by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould &amp; Morgan (2003)</ref>, purposely to select targets for transit searches. Since then, wider or improved approaches were attempted, the following one being the most relevant to our purposes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammons et al. (2006)</ref> developed an entirely empirical method to identify metal-rich, low main-sequence stars as targets for N2K, a radial velocity search for hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fischer et al. 2005)</ref>. A training set made of 1000 F, G, and K stars with both high-resolution spectra from <ref type="bibr">Valenti &amp; Fis- cher (2005)</ref> and photometry from Tycho-2/2MASS was employed to fit polynomials and spline functions to broad-band colors extracted from BT VT JHKs magnitudes and Tycho-2 proper motions. Those analytical functions were then interpolated on all the well-measured Tycho-2 sources with a χ 2 -minimization procedure, in order to derive distances and temperatures. For a selected subset of 354 822 FGK dwarfs, [M/H] and probability of multiplicity were also derived with the same technique, while T eff was estimated with a finer polynomial function. On FGK dwarfs with photometric errors σV &lt; 0.05 mag, the temperature and metallicity models give a standard error of 70 K and 0.14 dex, respectively. The binary model can remove 70% of doubles with 1.25 &lt; M1/M2 &lt; 3.0 from a magnitude-limited sample of dwarfs at a cost of cutting 20% of the sample. This technique primarily uses the distance (and hence the absolute magnitude) as a proxy to discriminate dwarfs from giants. It fails when trying to directly estimate log g. The main reasons are: 1) the physical processes that differentiate dwarfs from giants in photometry vary widely as a function of T eff : a single polynomial or even a spline cannot be expected to capture all possible effects; 2) some rare kinds of stars are underrepresented by the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref> training set, namely, blue giants and cool red dwarfs. Though reddening is not taken into account, using proper motions to infer the distance minimizes the contamination of the sample by giants, even at low Galactic latitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The contamination issue</head><p>The aim of our work is to select main-sequence dwarfs having a spectral type later than F5 (DLF5 herafter), possibly also including moderately evolved subgiants within the same SpT range (DSLF5 hereafter). Classification algorithms label catalog entries as positives (i.e., "good" targets which meet our requirements; P) or negatives (N), while the terms true (T) and false (F) refer to what these objects actually are. The four possible outcomes within this scheme are therefore TP, TN, FP, FN. Every classification technique which aims at selecting DLF5/DSLF5 stars can unavoidably 1) fail at including some objects which are indeed DLF5/DSLF5, that is it misses true negatives, and 2) include targets (mostly hot dwarfs, evolved giants or non-stellar objects) which are contaminants, otherwise called false positives. From here on, we define (i) completeness the fraction of true positives over the total number of true targets, TP/(TP+TN);</p><p>(ii) contamination the fraction of false positives over the total number of positives, FP/(TP+FP).</p><p>Ideally, we are searching for a technique which outputs a complete sample with zero contamination. The DSLF5/DLF5 samples are usually defined in terms of spectral type and luminosity class (Section 1). Translating this definition into a new one based on a range of T eff and log g would enable an easier, direct and more accurate comparison among different classification schemes. There is no general agreement in the literature on how to link stellar parameters to a given SpT, and second order effects, such as metallicity and ages, further complicate the problem. We define</p><p>• the main DSLF5 sample as MS or post-MS stars having T eff &lt; 6510 K and log g &gt; 3.0;</p><p>• the DLF5 subset as MS stars having T eff &lt; 6510 K and log g &gt; 3.5.</p><p>The thresholds on T eff and log g were set according to the empirical calibrations of the F5V SpT published on <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cox (2000)</ref> and on literature data compiled by E. Mamajek 5 and cross-matched with the PASTEL catalog of stellar spectroscopic parameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Soubiran et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In order to assess the completeness and contamination of a sample selected by the existing classification algorithms, we matched catalogs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ammons et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ofek (2008)</ref> (hereafter AM06 and OF08; typical examples of RPM and template matching based techniques, respectively) with a reliable catalog of atmospheric parameters. To that purpose, we chose the fourth and most recent data release (DR4) of the spectroscopic survey RAVE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Steinmetz et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kordopatis et al. 2013</ref>). RAVE, Radial Velocity Experiment 6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Steinmetz et al. 2006</ref>), is a spectroscopy survey at R 7000 resolution, based at the Australian Astronomical Observatory, aiming at delivering accurate radial velocities (∼1.5 km/s), atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances for about half a million stars in the Southern hemisphere. The RAVE sample is magnitude-limited at I &lt; 12, although not complete.</p><p>The DLF5 and DSLF5 subsets were extracted from the OF08 stars according to their "photometric" T eff and log g, following the definitions given above. As for the AM06 catalog, the authors provide a pre-selected subset of FGK mainsequence dwarfs, which we further trimmed at T eff &lt; 6510 K to obtain a pure DLF5 sample; no DSLF5 sample can be straightforwardly extracted from AM06, because no direct information on log g is available from this work. Now, let us focus on the DLF5 subsets of AM06 and OF08. Their distribution (red contours) is compared with that of the general field (black contours) and plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> as a function of their spectroscopic parameters T eff , log g as tabulated in RAVE DR4, for both AM06 (left panel) and OF08 (right panel) input catalogs. Following our previous definition, contamination and completeness were estimated with respect to the fraction of stars falling outside the boundaries log g &gt; 3.5 and T eff &lt; 6510 K as given by RAVE. The resulting contamination spans ∼ 25-38% for AM06 and OF08, respectively, while completeness spans ∼ 45-66% (Table 1). Contaminants are mostly red giants for OF08, and are equally shared between red giants and earlier main-sequence types for AM06. We also did a similar estimation on the   <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Belikov &amp; Röser (2008)</ref> catalog which is available to us is just a subsample of FGK dwarfs; without knowing the exact composition of the initial sample it is possible to estimate the contamination but not the completeness.</p><p>Belikov &amp; Röser (2008) catalog, which resulted in a ∼38.2% contamination, very close to the OF08 result <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>). Considering that the vast majority of a magnitude-limited sample is composed of early-type and evolved giants, photometric classification techniques such these ones represent an acceptable starting basis for the target selection process.</p><p>Unfortunately, all the reviewed catalogs including OF08 and AM06 are magnitude-limited (V 11) because they are based on Tycho-2. If we want to extend our classification to fainter stars (V 13), while taking advantage of RAVE DR4 as a reliable external calibrator with the aim of improving both completeness and contamination, we must use different input catalogs and devise a new classification algorithm. This is the main driver for the creation of our brand new all-sky catalog of DLF5 and DSLF5 stars, hereafter named UCAC4-RPM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">THE UCAC4-RPM CATALOG COMPILATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Input catalogs</head><p>We chose to adopt UCAC4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zacharias et al. 2013</ref>) as the starting point to build our new catalog. UCAC4 is a compiled, all-sky astrometric catalog designed to provide highquality CCD positions and proper motions for targets fainter than the limiting magnitude of Hipparcos and Tycho-2. The observations are designed to cover the R = 7.5 to 16.3 magnitude range, and were performed through one pass band at approx. 579-643 nm. Most observations were carried out in non-photometric conditions, but UCAC4 native magnitudes fmag have been calibrated against Tycho-2 stars and systematic errors are constrained within 0.1 mag, and sometimes much better. Positional errors are between 15-20 mas for stars <ref type="bibr">with</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Henden &amp; Munari 2014</ref>) in five filters: Johnson B and V , plus Sloan g, r, i. Once completed, APASS will cover the magnitude range between V 10 and V 17. It will conveniently link Tycho-2 to SDSS, plus cover the whole sky at the same depth of UCAC4. Johnson B and V were chosen to extend the Tycho-2 calibration to fainter magnitudes, while Sloan g , r , i will homogeneously extend the much deeper SDSS, SkyMapper, PanSTARRS surveys on the brighter end.</p><p>Three APASS data releases were published after the official release of UCAC4: DR7, DR8, and DR9 <ref type="bibr">(July 29, 2015</ref>), which in principle should have improved both the completeness and the photometric accuracy of the APASS survey. We merged UCAC4 and APASS DR8 to test this assumption and actually found the opposite: by matching the resulting catalog with a set of photometric standards it is easy to see that the photometric homogeneity is much worse with respect to APASS DR6. This is easily explained by some problems, which occurred during the DR7-DR9 observing campaigns and described in the release notes, which include the "blue" camera malfunctions in the Northern hemisphere and the "red" camera's poor focus in the Southern hemisphere. Many of these problems are expected to be solved in the forthcoming DR10; meanwhile, we adopt the DR6 magnitudes throughout the present paper.</p><p>As a further step, we truncated UCAC4 at V &lt; 10, where APASS photometry saturates, and replaced those entries with the corresponding photometry and proper motions from Tycho-2, converting Tycho (BT , VT ) to Johnson (B, V ) through the standard transformations given by <ref type="bibr">Høg et al. (2000)</ref>. During this process we identified 176 662 UCAC4 entries at V &gt; 10 for which the tabulated B, V magnitudes were mistakenly copied from Tycho-2 (BT , VT ) without any transformation; we fixed these entries by forcing the correct transformations as above. Finally, APASS magnitudes are not complete down to fmag = 13.5 on some particular regions of the northern sky, so for those missing entries we calibrated UCAC4 fmag and 2MASS J and K against the most recent set of secondary U BV RI photometric standards </p><p>where the RMS scatter around the best fit is calculated within the range of interest 10 &lt; V &lt; 13. The resulting catalog, trimmed at fmag &lt; 13.5 to be more easily manageable, will be called UCAC4-RPM hereafter. Even taking into account color effects in V − fmag, this sample is magnitude-complete at V &lt; 13 for FGK spectral types. and constitutes a perfect basis to cherry-pick targets for space-based exoplanet transit search missions such as TESS and PLATO. Coincidentally, V = 13 is also the typical limiting magnitude of the most fruitful wide-field, ground-based transit searches, making our effort of more general use. The overall number of UCAC4-RPM entries is 10 198 407, of which 9 928 389 have at least proper motions and B, V photometry either from Tycho2 or from APASS. RAVE DR4 lists 425 561 stars, of which 412 741 are in common with UCAC4-RPM. 375 203 of them have valid proper motions, B, V magnitudes, and atmospheric parameters. The latter subset consists of stars which share a reliable estimate of log g and T eff from RAVE (∆ log g 0.3 dex, ∆T eff 150 K on average), span the full range of Galactic latitude and perfectly overlap the typical magnitude range of our stellar sample. In other words, this is an ideal training set to calibrate RPM-based selections on the whole UCAC4-RPM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Defining the RPM selection</head><p>Before selecting stars according to their RPMs, one has to choose which photometric bands to employ for the color (horizontal axis of the RPMD) and the RPM itself (vertical axis). While the proper motion of a given UCAC4-RPM entry is unique, two or three magnitudes have to be chosen from B, V , J, K, the latter two originating from 2MASS and included in UCAC4-RPM through UCAC4.</p><p>We ran several tests to see the impact of this choice on the ability of the RPMD to properly separate the main sequence from the evolved stars: the resulting RPMD for four different test choices, namely (B − V , RPM(V )), (J − K, RPM(J)), (J − K, RPM(V )), (V − J, RPM(V )) are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, where the log g from RAVE is color-coded from 0.0 (blue) to 5.0 dex (red). At first sight, when integrating the results over the whole sky, all four choices are effective in separating the two "bumps" corresponding to main-sequence stars (centered approximately on unevolved F dwarfs) and red giants. However, the (B − V , RPM(V )) diagram performs better at low Galactic latitudes, where interstellar extinction plays a crucial role on the most distant stars. This is easily explained by the fact that B − V is the color most affected by extinction. While nearby, late-type main-sequence dwarfs share a negligible or very small extinction, distant stars (which are mostly contaminating giants) are moved farther from the main sequence by the reddening vector, making the dwarf/giant separation easier. For this reason, we adopted the (B − V , RPM(V )) plane to perform the following RPM calibrations and selections.</p><p>While one could in principle draw an empirical boundary line between giants and dwarfs on the RPMD by hand (as done, among others, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gould &amp; Morgan 2003)</ref>, a more rigorous and quantitative approach is advisable when working with precise requirements on SpT (or, equivalently, on T eff and log g) as in our case. We first subdivided the RPMD plotted with all the stars in common between UCAC4-RPM and RAVE into small rectangular cells having side lengths equal to ∆(B − V ) = 0.05 mag and ∆RPM(V) = 0.5 mag (unfilled circles in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4, left panels)</ref>. Each star in a given cell is classified as a genuine DLF5/DSLF5 target, or as a contaminant, according to its RAVE T eff , log g based on the T eff &lt; 6510 K, log g &gt; 4.0 (DLF5) or T eff &lt; 6510 K, log g &gt; 3.5 (DSLF5) criterion. The fraction Φ of genuine targets over contaminants is then evaluated for each cell. After some trial-and-error attempts, we define those cells having Φ &gt; 50% as "good", though this threshold can be changed depending on whether one desires to increase the completeness (lower Φ threshold) or to decrease the contamination (higher Φ) of the final sample. Cells in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> are drawn as blue circles if Φ &gt; 50%, and green otherwise. As a final step, with the aim of speeding up the computation, we approximated our RPM selection encompassing "good" cells through a polynomial chain (red line in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> for the DSLF5 selection; the "and" and "or" logical operators have their usual meaning.</p><p>Eq. 3 and 4 can be applied to the full UCAC4- <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.

Left panels: Reduced proper-motion diagrams for a subset of stars in common between RAVE DR4 and UCAC4-RPM. Both RPMDs are subdivided into cells (unfilled circles). The stars in each cell are classified as genuine DLF5/DSLF5 targets or as contaminants according to their RAVE T eff , log g; then the cell is drawn in blue if at least 50% of them are bona-fide DLF5/DSLF5 sources, and green otherwise. Our RPM selection encompassing "good" cells is approximated by a red polynomial chain, corresponding to the Eq. 3 and 4 numerical cuts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Estimating completeness and contamination</head><p>To estimate the completeness and contamination of our UCAC4-RPM classifications, following the same approach 9 http://groups.dfa.unipd.it/ESPG applied in Section 3.3, we can put our subsamples into the RAVE DR4 log g vs. T eff diagram to check how many points lie in the allowed DLF5/DSLF5 region a posteriori, and how many of the RAVE DR4 dwarfs are effectively selected as such by our algorithm. The results are tabulated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Our approach results in a comparable amount of contamination (≈28%) and much better completeness (≈80%) with respect to the previous classification attempts (AM06, OF08), i.e. we end up with a much cleaner sample of dwarfs and subgiants at a fainter limiting magnitude. This result is probably close to the intrinsic limit of the RPM technique, which is a statistical method.</p><p>In principle, every photometric classification technique is expected to worsen its performances when moving to the densest regions, i.e., close to the Galactic plane. The first reason is because crowding impacts the accuracy of the input <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.

This could be an issue for APASS (our primary source of optical magnitudes at V &gt; 10), because the pixel scale of that survey is 2.57 arcsec/pixel, and the PSFs were deliberately defocused to a FWHM of 1.5-2.0 pixels. On the other hand, our targets are relatively bright (V &lt; 13) and only marginally affected by confusion down to a few degrees from the Galactic plane. A second reason is that lines of sight at low Galactic latitudes can reach very high values of interstellar extinction as the distance increases, therefore early-type stars can be misidentified as later-type dwarfs. This effect is larger at the faint end of the sample, which probes a larger volume of space. But this is counterbalanced by another effect which actually improves the giant/dwarf separation on very reddened lines of sight: evolved stars are moved farther from the main sequence on the RPMD, as explained in Sec. 4.2.</p><p>To assess how much the proximity to the Galactic plane could be a limiting factor to our classification, we redid the completeness/contamination estimate as above by selecting UCAC4-RPM stars within three different ranges of Galactic latitudes: |b| &lt; 10, 10 &lt; |b| &lt; 20, and |b| &gt; 20 ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. The results are pretty clear: on average, the efficiency of our algorithm is not significantly impacted by b. The contamination level is remarkably constant at ≈ 28%, while completeness actually improves a bit toward the Galactic plane, from ≈ 71%. to ≈ 81%. By looking at an all-sky chart of DSLF5 stars <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>, it is easy to notice that their surface density increases by a factor of two to three from the Galactic poles to the disk, as predicted by stellar models such as TRILEGAL or Besançon Galactic models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Girardi et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Robin et al. 2003</ref>) for DSLF5 stars. The only exception is the presence of a few overdensities at very low b (blue regions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5)</ref>, where the fraction of false positives is much larger than 30%. These regions, however, cover only a negligible fraction of the sky and therefore do not significantly contribute to the overall statistics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Comparison with Galactic models</head><p>As a further validation of our catalog, we made a more detailed comparison between UCAC4-RPM and GUMS (Gaia Universe Model Snapshot; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Robin et al. 2012</ref>) an all-sky synthetic catalog based on an updated version of the Besançon Galactic model (BGM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Robin et al. 2003</ref>) and aimed to a realistic simulation of the Gaia performances. Such analysis should be regarded not only as a validation check for UCAC4-RPM, but also as a test for the BGM and its underlying assumptions, the most relevant of which for our purposes is the luminosity function of the Solar neighborhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reid et al. 2002)</ref>. UCAC4-RPM is a magnitude-limited sample, as opposed to a volume-limited one, so the local luminosity functions must be first convolved by a Galactic model to get a meaningful comparison. It is worth noting that, at the faint limit considered here, UCAC4-RPM is probing heliocentric distances up to ∼ 830 pc (assuming MV (F5V) = 3.4 at V = 13), with a median distance of ∼ 300 pc for a typical Sun-like star (MV (G2V) = 4.8 at V = 12.1). As a reference, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Reid et al. (2002)</ref> luminosity function is based on a Hipparcos sample volume-limited at 25 pc.</p><p>Both UCAC4-RPM and GUMS were first cut at V &lt; 13 (where UCAC4-RPM is complete), then only the DLF5 stars were selected by imposing log g &gt; 3.5 and T eff &lt; 6510 K following our definition in Sec. 3.3. In order to perform a fair comparison, a further cut was set at |b| &gt; 10 • to exclude regions close to the Galactic plane, where extinction maps (including that by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Drimmel et al. 2003</ref> implemented by GUMS) are known to be unreliable in reproducing the observed stellar counts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Marshall et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Schultheis et al. 2014</ref>). The resulting histogram as a function of T eff is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> The total number of UCAC4-RPM DLF5 dwarfs at V &lt; 13 and |b| &lt; 10 • is 1 770 693, that is 21% more than the 1 460 174 predicted by GUMS. This is a reasonable agreement after considering that the overall contamination rate of UCAC4-RPM is estimated to be at about 28% <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. A closer look to <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> reveals that while the counts for the F0-F5 subsample (T eff &gt; 5908 K) are essentially identical in the two catalogs (598 194 vs. 617 643, −3.1%), the stars in excess in UCAC4-RPM come from the G (5310 &lt; T eff &lt; 5908 K, 879 558 vs. 638 652, +37%) and K subsets (T eff &lt; 5310 K, <ref type="bibr">292 941 vs. 199 315, +47%)</ref>. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the excess counts come from contaminating subgiants, since they are predicted to belong mostly to the G and K spectral types (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, right panels). Summarizing, the UCAC4-RPM results seem to be in a generally good agreement with the current models of the Solar neighborhood and their assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF UCAC4-RPM FOR EXOPLANET SEARCHES</head><p>UCAC4-RPM is nicely suited to build a preliminary input catalog for future space-based missions, like TESS and PLATO, as well as ongoing and forthcoming ground-based surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">TESS</head><p>With its four wide-field optical cameras pointed toward different lines of sight, TESS will simultaneously monitor a 24 • × 94 • strip (i.e., 2 300 deg 2 ) for 27 days, then it will take a 26 • turn around the Ecliptic pole and repeat this cycle in order to scan nearly the full sky at Ecliptic latitude |β| &gt; 6 • during its two-year nominal mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>). The temporal coverage will therefore range from 27 d at low ecliptic latitudes, to about 1 year over 900 deg 2 close to the ecliptic poles. The prime targets for TESS are main-sequence dwarfs from F5 to M5; photon noise and confusion set the limiting magnitude at Ic 12, or roughly V 13 at K2V. While TESS will transmit the full-frame images back to Earth with a 30-min cadence, a highest-priority subset of ∼ 200 000 preselected stars will be monitored at a cadence of 2 min. Being magnitude limited at V 13.5 and focused on DLF5 stars, UCAC4-RPM is perfectly suited to support the TESS target selection. It provides a sample of ∼ 2 600 000 V &lt; 13 dwarfs from which the TESS target list can be cherry-picked according to a prioritization scheme based on the expected transit detection efficiency. Such an approach should be regarded as complementary to that developed by the TESS Target Selection Working Group (TWSG), which is in charge of building the TESS Target Catalog (TTC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stassun et al. 2014</ref>). The TTC is based on a different combination of input catalogs with respect to UCAC4-RPM, and on different selection algorithms and thresholds.</p><p>While the full TTC has not been released to the community yet, a public subset of it covering the K2 fields is named K2-TESS and documented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stassun et al. (2014)</ref>. K2-TESS allows us to probe the overlap region between our catalog and the TTC. If, for instance, we cross-match the K2 "Campaign 2" field with UCAC4-RPM, we get 5 662 DSLF5 (of which 4 726 are DLF5). Among these, 565 UCAC4-RPM dwarfs are missed by K2-TESS, while there are 2 234 K2-TESS dwarfs missed by UCAC4-RPM, mostly because of their faintness (V &gt; 13.5, J &gt; 11.5). This is somewhat expected since the two catalogs are based on different methodologies and input catalogs reflecting different scientific priorities. While K2-TESS is more focused on cool SpTs (late K and M dwarfs) and mainly based on the 2MASS infrared photometry, UCAC4-RPM is focused on solar-type FGK targets, implying different selection algorithms and thresholds. In other words, the two approaches will be highly synergic in selecting the optimal targets for TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Stassun et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">PLATO</head><p>The unique optical design of PLATO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rauer et al. 2014</ref>) is driven by the requirement to cover a significant fraction of the sky with a good image quality in order to achieve an UCAC4-RPM GUMS <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Histogram comparing the temperature distribution of a magnitude-limited sample of dwarf stars from UCAC4-RPM (this work; blue bars) and from the GUMS simulated catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Robin et al. 2012</ref>; red bars) based on the Besancon Galactic model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Robin et al. 2003</ref>). Both samples are cut at V &lt; 13 and |b| &gt; 10 • . The two dashed vertical lines mark the boundary between G/K and F/G main-sequence spectral types, respectively. unprecedented photometric precision: &lt; 34 ppm/h (parts per millions measured over a 1-hour time scale) for the main scientific sample limited at V &lt; 11, and even better for the brightest stars of the sample at V 6 (dominated by systematic errors). The present design of PLATO implies that the array of 12-cm telescopes is subdivided into four groups, each group pointing towards a direction which is displaced by an angle θ = 9.2 deg from the center of the overall field of view (FOV). Such strategy provides a nonuniform instantaneous coverage of a 2124 deg 2 field.</p><p>The observing strategy of PLATO consists of a twostep approach in order to maximize the scientific return of the mission. PLATO will image two "long-duration" (LD) fields for more than two years each, and some supplementary fields for a few months each, during the "step &amp; stare" (S&amp;S) phase. The LD phase will fullfil the main scientific objective of the mission, being sensitive to planets down to the Earth's size orbiting within the habitable zone (HZ) of solartype (FGK) stars. The S&amp;S fields will expand the accessible sky area by about one order of magnitude, giving us access to a larger number of bright nearby stars at the expense of probing a smaller range of orbital periods. A simple calculation shows that, at the end of a nominal 6.5-year mission with 2 LD and 10 S&amp;S fields, PLATO will have surveyed about two thirds of the whole sky.</p><p>The PLATO Science Requirements Document 10 (SRD) defines five complementary stellar samples to be surveyed, listed in decreasing priority and summarized below:</p><p>• P1: DSLF5 stars brighter than V = 11, monitored with a photometric noise level σ ≤ 34 ppm/h, to be observed during the LD phase;</p><p>• P2, P3: DSLF5 stars brighter than V = 8, monitored at σ ≤ 34 ppm/h, to be observed during the LD and S&amp;S phase, respectively.</p><p>10 ID code: ESA-PLATO-ESTEC-SCI-RS-001.</p><p>• P4: cool M dwarfs (M0 or later), to be monitored during the LD phase of the mission (at V &lt; 16), or during the S&amp;S phase (at V &lt; 15). The photometric noise level for both subsamples must be below 800 ppm/h;</p><p>• P5: DSLF5 stars brighter than V = 13, to be observed during the LD phase.</p><p>Samples P1, P2, P3, P5 are therefore all made of "solarlike" stars brighter than V = 13. Due to telemetry limitations, PLATO will not be able to download the full images, collected with cadence between 60 s (normal telescopes) and 2.5 s (for the two "fast" telescope, dedicated to bright stars, and the only ones equipped with two filters, for color measurement). Only for a limited subsample of targets it will be possible to download imagettes. Most of the photometry must be done on board on the selected targets, and also the imagette centers must be pre-selected. In other words, PLATO needs an input catalog (PIC: PLATO Input Catalog). It is clear that our new UCAC4-RPM represents the most appropriate tool to preliminarly select and prioritize the target sample. It also is of basic importance for a selection of PLATO fields, needed, for engineering reasons, well before GAIA catalogs can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Ground-based surveys</head><p>UCAC4-RPM is made publicly available to the astronomical community. Its magnitude range 6 V 13 makes it exploitable for the ongoing ground-based transit surveys such as SuperWASP/WASP South ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pollacco et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hel- lier et al. 2011</ref>), HatNet/Hat-South ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bakos et al. 2009b</ref>,a), KELT/KELT-South ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pepper et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pepper et al. , 2012</ref>) or NGTS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chazelas et al. 2012</ref>) to vet and prioritize the list of planetary candidates and to discard transit-like signals originating from early-type or giant stars, when no other source of reliable stellar parameters is available. A careful preliminary characterization of the target stars has been proven to greatly speed up the follow-up process, avoiding a loss of observing time and resources by monitoring false positives ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Almenara et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Throughout the previous sections, we described how we devised a new RPM-based algorithm to assign a luminosity class to field stars by knowing only their proper motions and two optical magnitudes. By applying this optimal algorithm on a new stellar catalog compiled by matching UCAC4, APASS DR6 and Tycho-2, we ended up with UCAC4-RPM -an all-sky sample of solar-type dwarf stars complete down to at least V 13. We demonstrated that the latter catalog, once complemented by subgiants within the same spectral type range, meets the requirements set by the PLATO team for the target selection of its main stellar samples. In particular, the relatively low level of contamination (30%) of UCAC4-RPM, together with a 80% completeness, is well suited to PLATO (but also TESS), whose telemetry allows us to select many more targets with respect to the nominal requirement of P1 stars, therefore compensating for the fraction lost due to contaminants. UCAC4-RPM proved to be helpful as a starting point to select the (provisional) coordinates of the long-duration pointing fields, which are needed at this stage to tune the observational strategy, to run engineering tests and to plan an optimal follow-up strategy for the object of interest to be delivered by PLATO. Also ongoing and forthcoming groud-based survey for exoplanet search may benefit by UCAC4-RPM catalog.</p><p>It is possible to take future steps to improve UCAC4-RPM. The most obvious one is the inclusion of newer relases of APASS, to rely on a more accurate, complete and homogeneous source of B and V magnitudes. APASS DR8 and DR9 are already available, but both suffer from photometric inhomogeneity due to the inclusion of more recent data and a filter change; it is expected that APASS DR10, still to be released, will solve most of these problems. Additionally the training set used in the present work (RAVE) could be improved by including other wide-field spectroscopic surveys, such as SDSS/SEGUE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Yanny et al. 2009</ref>) and especially LAMOST/LEGUE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Deng et al. 2012</ref>), which will enable us to calibrate our RPM selections on both hemispheres (RAVE is limited to b ≤ 0) and to fainter magnitudes, i.e., including more dwarfs of K and M spectral types. We performed a preliminary cross-check by mapping the surface gravity listed on the first public release of LAMOST (DR1) on the full UCAC4-RPM sample. As expected, the LAMOST parameters confirm the accuracy of our previous dwarf vs. giant separation on the RPM diagram based on RAVE <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. Once the first LAMOST complete release will be made available to the community, we expect to increase the size of our training set by a factor of ten.</p><p>The Gaia final catalog, to be released no earlier than 2024, is expected to make UCAC4-RPM obsolete on most of the sky, thanks to its accurate spectrophotometric measurements (BP/RP instrument) and exquisitely precise geometrical parallaxes (ASTRO instrument). However, the algorithms on which UCAC4-RPM is based could help in exploiting the Gaia data to estimate luminosity classes at V &gt; 11 much earlier than 2024, starting from the second intermediate release (DR2; end of 2017), when just BP/RP integrated magnitudes and proper motions will be available, but not distances or surface gravities. A modified version of the algorithm presented in Section 4 can be easily adapted and calibrated through LAMOST+RAVE to work in the (GBP − GRP, RPM(G)) plane.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Notes. Contamination and completeness fractions are defined in Section 3.3. (1) the Ammons et al. (2006) catalog does not provide 
log g; instead, a pre-compiled set of FGK dwarfs is available, from which we trimmed a DLF5 sample by imposing T eff &lt; 6510 K; no 
extension to DSLF5 is possible. (2) the completeness limit of Tycho-2 is here assumed to be V 11, though slightly depending on SpT 
and Galactic latitude. (3) the Ofek (2008) DLF5 and DSLF5 sample are selected according to the best-χ 2 Pickles (1998) template. (4)
