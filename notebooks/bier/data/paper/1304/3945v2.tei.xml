				<p>9 We extend the analysis of the thermodynamics of the climate system by investigating the role 10 played by processes taking place at various spatial and temporal scales through a procedure of 11 coarse graining. We show that the coarser is the graining of the climatic fields, the lower is 12 the resulting estimate of the material entropy production. In other terms, all the spatial and 13 temporal scales of variability of the thermodynamic fields provide a positive contribution to the 14 material entropy production. This may be interpreted also as that, at all scales, the temperature 15 fields and the heating fields resulting from the convergence of turbulent fluxes have a negative 16 correlation, while the opposite holds between the temperature fields and the radiative heating 17 fields. Moreover, we obtain that the latter correlations are stronger, which confirms that radiation 18 acts as primary driver for the climatic processes, while the material fluxes dampen the resulting 19 fluctuations through dissipative processes. We also show, using specific coarse-graining procedures, 20 how one can separate the various contributions to the material entropy production coming from 21 the dissipation of kinetic energy, the vertical sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the large scale 22 horizontal fluxes, without resorting to the full three-dimensional time dependent fields. We find that 23 most of the entropy production is associated to irreversible exchanges occurring along the vertical 24 direction, and that neglecting the horizontal and time variability of the fields has a relatively small 25 impact on the estimate of the material entropy production. The approach presented here seems 26 promising for testing climate models, for assessing the impact of changing their parametrizations 27 and their resolution, as well as for investigating the atmosphere of exoplanets, because it allows for 28 evaluating the error in the estimate of their thermodynamical properties due to the lack of high-29 resolution data. The findings on the impact of coarse graining on the thermodynamic fields on 30 the estimate of the material entropy production deserve to be explored in a more general context, 31 because they provide a way for understanding the relationship between forced fluctuations and 32 dissipative processes in continuum systems.</p>

Starting from the output fields at the highest possible resolution given by the 97 model (temporal resolution of one time step, and same spatial resolution of the actual 98 numerical model), we perform a coarse graining in space and in time to the dynamical and 99 thermodynamical fields appearing in the terms describing the entropy production of the 100 system, and we test how the estimate of the entropy production changes when different <ref type="bibr">101</ref> coarse graining are applied to the data. We anticipate that we obtain that the coarser is 102 the graining procedure, the lower is the estimate of the entropy production one obtains, as <ref type="bibr">103</ref> somehow intuitive. One must note that this is, in fact an obvious result when considering 104 simple diffusive system, but not so obvious when fully nonlinear, multiphase systems are 105 considered. We also obtain similar results when considering different degrees of longitudinal <ref type="bibr">106</ref> averaging of the fields, up to considering zonally averaged fields only. Our findings provide 107 a way to assess how having low-resolution information about the dynamics of turbulent 108 systems affects our ability to reconstruct its thermodynamical properties. Moreover, the 109 procedure discussed in this paper allows to put on firmer ground the results proposed in 110 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref> on the possibility of separating vertical and horizontal exchange processes as far as 111 entropy production is concerned. Finally, we can study in detail the relationship between 112 two apparently equivalent ways of computing the entropy production proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>113</head><p>This paper is structured as follows. In section II we briefly recapitulate some definitions <ref type="bibr">114</ref> and equations relevant for setting the problem of computing the entropy production of the 115 climate system we explain how to perform such a calculation in a climate model. In section <ref type="bibr">116</ref> III we explain what we mean precisely by coarse graining of the data and describe how it <ref type="bibr">117</ref> is actually implemented in the model's output. We also provide some conjectures what will <ref type="bibr">118</ref> be discussed in later in the paper. In section IV we present our results. We first describe <ref type="bibr">119</ref> the impact of performing coarse graining on time alone, thus exploring the range between <ref type="bibr">120</ref> time step data and long term averaged data, and then we extend our analysis to the space obtained from the data analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CLIMATE ENTROPY BUDGET</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>127</head><p>Following <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20]</ref>, for any system it is possible to decompose the rate of change of its 128 entropy dS/dt as dS/dt = d e S/dt + d i S/dt, where the first term is called the external and 129 the second term is the internal contribution to the entropy budget. The external contribution <ref type="bibr">130</ref> corresponds to the entropy flux through the boundaries of the system whereas the internal 131 entropy production is associated with the irreversible processes taking place in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>132</head><p>The second law of thermodynamics imposes that the internal entropy production has to <ref type="bibr">133</ref> be nonnegative at all instants, so that d i S/dt ≥ 0. When a statistically steady state is 134 achieved, the external and internal entropy production have to balance each other so that 135 the total rate of entropy change is zero: we have dS/dt = 0 → d i S/dt = −d e S/dt ≥ 0, where 136 the overline indicates averaging over a long time interval compared to the internal scales of <ref type="bibr">137</ref> the system. The previous expression means that a non-equilibrium system generates on <ref type="bibr">138</ref> the average a positive amount of entropy through irreversible processes, and such excess 139 of entropy is expelled at the boundaries. Non-equilibrium is maintained if the system is 140 in contact with more than one reservoir with given temperature and/or chemical potential 141 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[7]</ref>. Of course, if the system is at equilibrium, the previous inequality becomes an equality, <ref type="bibr">142</ref> as in the long run the system reaches an homogeneous state of maximum entropy and no <ref type="bibr">143</ref> additional entropy is generated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>144</head><p>In the climate system two rather different set of processes contribute to the total entropy 145 production <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>. The first set of processes are responsible for the irreversible thermali-146 sation of the photons emitted near the Sun's corona at roughly 5700 K at the much lower <ref type="bibr">147</ref> temperatures, typical of the Earth's climate. This contributes for about 95% of the total system, and taking long term averages, one can derive the following equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">14]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">157 V d 3 x ˙ q rad T + ˙ s mat = 0 (1)</formula><p>where the integral is over the whole volume V of the climate system, ˙ q rad is the radiative 158 heating rate, ˙ s mat is the instantaneous specific rate of material entropy production due to 159 irreversible processes involving the climatic fluid, and T the temperature field.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>186</head><p>In an actual climate model the implementation of entropy diagnostics faces some difficul-187 ties, both at theoretical level and in terms of practical implementation of the entropy-related 188 diagnostics. A theoretical difficulty is that, as evidenced in <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>, many state-of-the-art cli-189 mate models features an inconsistent energetics, such that when all parameters are held 190 fixed and the system reaches a steady state, the long-term average of the energy budget 191 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which is the only boundary of the climate system, is sink of energy somewhere inside the system. More specific analyses make clear that such 197 spurious sinks are related to the imperfect closure of the hydrological cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> and to the 198 inconsistent treatment of the dissipation of kinetic energy, which is not entirely (or at all) 199 fed back into the system as thermal energy <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>. at the top-of-the-atmosphere we have only radiative fields, using Gauss' theorem, the mate-216 rial entropy production can be worked out by considering all the material diabatic heating <ref type="bibr">217</ref> rates, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">218 ˙ S dir mat = V d 3 x ǫ 2 T − ∇ · F SH T − ∇ · F LH T = V d 3 x ˙ q mat T<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In this paper we refer to the entropy budget of the FAMOUS GCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref> which has been 219 studied in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">37]</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>248</head><p>Therefore, in practice, we compute ˙ S dir mat as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">249 ˙ S dir mat = k c Vc d 3 x ˙ q c k T (8)</formula><p>where ˙ q c k is the local instantaneous heating rate occurring in the subdomain V c due to the 250 process k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>251</head><p>The evaluation of ˙ S ind mat is much easier because the heating rates are readily available from 252 the radiation scheme, which affects all the subdomains c of the climate system:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">253 ˙ S ind mat = − c Vc d 3 x ˙ q c sw T + ˙ q c lw T<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where we have divided the contribution ˙ q sw coming from the shortwave radiation, which </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">266 X(x, t) τ v = 1 τ µ(v, t) v d 3 y τ /2 −τ /2 dσX(x + y, t + σ)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">µ(v(x), t) = v(x)</formula><p>d 3 x is the mass contained in the stencil v(x) at time t. Massweighting is the natural choice in climate models as hydrostatic approximation is almost invariably used and vertical coordinates are expressed to a very good approximation in terms of pressure levels. Since the integrands in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref> are nonlinear, we obviously have that for every τ and v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">˙ S dir mat = V d 3 x ˙ q mat T = V d 3 x ˙ q mat τ v T τ v = ˙ S dir mat τ v ,<label>(11)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">˙ S ind mat = − V d 3 x ˙ q rad T = − V d 3 x ˙ q rad τ v T τ v = ˙ S ind mat τ v .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Moreover, while as discussed before ˙ S dir mat = ˙ S ind mat , there is no a priori reason to expect that ˙ S dir mat τ v and ˙ S ind mat τ v have the same value. Finally, we have that up to first order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">˙ S dir mat − ˙ S dir mat τ v = ∆ S dir mat τ v ≃ − V d 3 x ∆ [ ˙ q mat ] τ v ∆ [T ] τ v [T τ v ] 2<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">˙ S ind mat − ˙ S ind mat τ v = ∆ S ind mat τ v ≃ V d 3 x ∆ [ ˙ q rad ] τ v ∆ [T ] τ v [T τ v ] 2<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∆ [X] τ v = X − X τ v . It is natural to interpret ˙ S ind mat τ v , ˙ S dir mat τ v as the contribution 267</formula><p>to the entropy production due to irreversible processes occurring on scales large than what preted as the contributions to the entropy production given by the material flows (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(13)</ref>) <ref type="bibr">270</ref> and radiative fluxes (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref>) with variability confined below the spatial scale given by v</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>271</head><p>and by the time scale given by τ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>272</head><p>Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(11)</ref> can be used for the indirect or direct formula for the entropy production, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>314</head><p>As the primary driving of climate is indeed the radiative forcing, while the fluid flows tend to dampen the resulting temperature gradients through instabilities, Therefore, one expects that the correlations between temperature and heating fields are stronger when considering the radiative fields as sources of heating. In other terms, the convergence of heat due to geophysical flows are neither strong nor fast enough to counter exactly the radiative forcing at all scales. As an example, one may consider the fact that the radiativeconvective equilibrium is typically baroclinically unstable in the mid-latitudes, and, indeed, baroclinic disturbances reduce the North-South temperature gradient by transporting heat from South to North, but cannot reduce it to zero. Taking into consideration Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(13)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(14)</ref>, the different role -forcings vs. dampening -of the convergence of the radiative fluxes vs.</p><p>material turbulent fluxes leads us to proposing an additional inequality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>315</head><p>We first discuss briefly how the coarse graining operation is performed in practice.

Therefore, we subdivide the 321 domain V of integration into Q subdomains v q , q = 1, . . . , Q, each containing (in the bulk of 322 the model's domain) R grid points. Given an intensive thermodynamic field X(x k , t j ), for 323 n = 1, . . . , N and q = 1, . . . , Q, we define its coarse grained version as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">324 X(q, n) τ v = 1 τ µ(v q , n) Rq j=R(q−1)+1 M n k=M (n−1)+1 dtµ(x j , σ k )X(x j , σ k ),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">µ(x j , σ k ) = ν(x j )ρ(x j , σ k )</formula><p>is the mass contained in the grid box centered around x j of 325 volume ν(x j ) at time σ k and µ(v q , n), correspondingly, is the time averaged (for time ranging <ref type="bibr">326</ref> from t M (n−1)+1 and t M n ) mass contained in the domain v q of volume ν(v q ). Therefore, our 327 estimate of the coarse grained value of the material entropy production is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">328 ˙ S dir mat τ v = 1 N Q i=1 N l=1 ν(v i ) ˙ q mat (i, l) τ v T (i, l) τ v<label>(16)</label></formula><p>for the so-called direct formula, and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">329 ˙ S ind mat τ v = − 1 N Q i=1 N l=1 ν(v i ) ˙ q rad (i, l) τ v T (i, l) τ v<label>(17)</label></formula><p>for the so-called indirect formula. These formulas are the discretized versions of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(11)</ref> 330 and Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">(12)</ref>, respectively. Obviously, the discrete versions of the exact formulas for the shown to be entirely negligible in terms of entropy production <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref>, and so are discarded.</p></div>

The mixing layer scheme 429 [21] parametrizes the convection due to heating at depth and cooling at the surface as well 430 as the mechanical stirring due to wind and is introduced in ocean models in order to account 431 for the seasonal thermocline variations. The coarse grained value of this term goes virtually 432 to zero for τ ≥ 1 because, when considering such an averaging, we discount for the impact 433 of the seasonal cycle in the upper portion of the ocean. 434 B. Spatial and Temporal coarse-graining 435 In this section we analyze the combined effect of coarse graining the heating rates and 436 temperature fields in space and time by using extensively Eqs. 16 and 17. Of course, there 437 are many ways to perform coarse graining, boiling down to the selection of the stencil v 438 introduced before. Summarizing, we proceed as follows: 439 1. longitudinal averaging: the stencils v are given by arcs of varying length in the zonal 440 direction; 441 2. areal averaging: the stencils v are given by portions of varying size of the spherical 442 surface; 443 3. mass averaging: the stencils v are given by same-mass portions of the atmospheric 444 spherical shell obtained by thickening in the vertical direction the stencils described 445 in 2.; 446 in all cases we perform also temporal coarse graining by selecting the same averaging times 447 τ described in the previous subsection.</figDesc></figure>

In order to avoid 454 the spurious effects of remapping the thermodynamic fields to a new coordinate system, 455 we choose coarse grained grid boxes that respect as much as possible the original model's 456 resolution.</figDesc></figure>

303 instead, 306 

climate is 1. forced by anomalies in the radiative forcing, and 2. the atmospheric and oceanic

circulations reduce the resulting temperature gradients. Climate processes are related in

In order to keep coherence with the</figDesc><table>(a). As a 

477 

general fact, we observe that the coarse grained estimates of the entropy production decrease 

478 

(or remain virtually unchanged) as we perform coarser and coarser graining procedure, in 

479 

time or in space, and that ˙ 
S dir 
mat τ 
v ≥ ˙ 
S ind 
mat τ 
v . 

480 

The strongest dependence of the ˙ 
S ind 
mat τ 
v is on τ : temporal coarse graining appears to 

481 

be the dominating influence, while the effect of spatial coarse graining is apparent only 

482 

for τ ≤ 1 day and for considerable longitudinal averaging, such that features below 60 • 

483 

are smeared out. In other terms, longitudinal averaging starts to matter only when we 

484 

lose information on the alternating pattern continents/oceans. The total effect of removing 

485 

totally the spatial structure is similar to that of performing a time-averaging of one day. 

486 

When considering ˙ 
S ind 
mat τ 
v the picture is partially different: first, the influence of the spatial 

487 

averaging is relatively strong at all scales for τ ≤ 1 day. The coupling between the spatial 

488 

and temporal scales indicates that using low pass filter and space and time we remove the 

489 

fast traveling synoptic waves of the mid-latitudes. As opposed to the case of the coarse 

490 

grained indirect estimate of the entropy production, spatial averaging plays a role also for 1 

491 

day ≤ τ ≤ 3 months. This is probably the signature of the relevance of low-frequency, large 

492 

scale features of the tropical circulation, which are sustained by longitudinal gradients (and 

493 

tend to reduce them), which are smeared out when extreme coarse graining is applied. 

494 Concluding, 497 

the full information. This agrees with the fact that, in first approximation, in our planet 

498 

longitudinal gradients and longitudinal heat fluxes are relatively small [41]. Moreover, using 

499 

either the direct or indirect formula we obtain rather similar results, with a bias of maximum 

500 

5%. As expected, the direct formula gives more accurate estimates for all considered coarse 

501 

graining procedures. 

502 

2. Areal averaging 

503 

508 

previous coarse graining procedure, we proceed as follows. We divide the spherical surface in 

509 

coarse grained grid boxes defined by intervals (in degrees in latitude and longitude) (∆λ∆φ) 

510 

such that ∆φ/∆λ = 1.5, which is consistent with the model's resolution of 5 • lat × 7.5 • lon. 

511 

We then increase ∆φ from 7.5 • up to 90 • , thus decreasing progressively the number of coarse 

512 

grained grids from 1728 to 12. In order to complete the coarse graining, we select as two 

513 

coarsest resolutions (∆λ; ∆φ) = (90 • , 180 • ) (four quadrants) and (∆λ; ∆φ) = (180 • , 360 • )

518 

to the previous case, the impact of selecting coarser and coarser graining in space reduces 

519 

considerably the value of ˙ 
S dir 
mat τ 
v for all values of τ , because such an averaging progressively 

520 

removes the strong meridional dependence of the thermodynamic fields, up to the extreme 

521 

case of v being the whole Earth's surface. In this case, the estimate of the entropy production 

522 

˙

523 

effect of changing τ is negligible, because the spatial averaging alone reduces the temporal 

524 correlations by mixing areas of the planet experiencing, e.g., different seasons. The τ -

544 

now dealing with three variables describing the coarse graining -the amplitude in latitude 

545 

∆φ, the number of levels n, and τ , we present two cross sections obtained for τ = 1 day 

546 

(virtually indistinguishable from τ = 1 hour) and τ = 1 year, reported as panels (a) and (c), 

547 

respectively, in both Figs. 5 and 6. In panels (b) and (d) of these two figures, we report, 

548 

instead, ∆

550 

As we know from the previous discussions, the function ˙ 
S dir 
mat τ 
v is relatively weakly af-

551 

fected by coarse graining along the horizontal directions and along the time axis. The modest 

552 

importance of time averaging is confirmed in this more complete analysis, as Figs. 5(a), and 

553 

5(c) are hard to distinguish. Instead, we find that averaging the thermodynamic fields along 

554 the vertical 557

558 

When considering the indirect formula, we can draw roughly the same conclusions as 

559 

above, with the difference that ˙ 
S ind 
mat τ 
v is more strongly affected by averaging along the 

560 

horizontal surface and along the time axis. Therefore, Figs. 6(a) and 6(c) feature clear 

561 

differences in terms of mean values, and, in each of them, the impact of performing very 

562 

coarse graining along the horizontal direction is more pronounced with respect to what 

563 

reported in Fig. 5. The effect of horizontal coarse graining become noticeable already when 

564 

grid boxes with side of (∆λ, ∆φ) ∼ (20 • , 30 • ) are considered. This implies that the spatial-

565 

temporal correlation between radiative heating and temperature fields is relevant for larger 

566 

range of scales than in the case of described above. These results put in firmer ground the 

567 

results given in [30].

ourselves to the contributions to the material entropy production coming from the presence
