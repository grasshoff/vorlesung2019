			<abstract>
				<p>The Apache Point Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets (APOSTLE) observed 10 transits of XO-2b over a period of three years. We present measurements which confirm previous estimates of system parameters like the normalized semi-major axis (a/R ⋆), stellar density (ρ ⋆), impact parameter (b) and orbital inclination (i orb). Our errors on system parameters like a/R ⋆ and ρ ⋆ have improved by ∼ 40% compared to previous best ground-based measurements. Our study of the transit times show no evidence for transit timing variations and we are able to rule out co-planar companions with masses ≥ 0.20M ⊕ in low order mean motion resonance with XO-2b. We also explored the stability of the XO-2 system given various orbital configurations of a hypothetical planet near the 2:1 mean motion resonance. We find that a wide range of orbits (including Earth-mass perturbers) are both dynamically stable and produce observable TTVs. We find that up to 51% of our stable simulations show TTVs that are smaller than the typical transit timing errors (∼20 sec) measured for XO-2b, and hence remain undetectable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Observational efforts on two fronts (ground-based and space-based) have revealed a great diversity in the properties of planets (and planet candidates), and posed several new 1 Astronomy Department, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 2 Virtual Planetary Laboratory, USA <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Google Inc., <ref type="bibr">Mountain View, CA 94043</ref> questions about the planet formation process. The search for planets and the careful measurement of planetary properties are the observational foundations upon which the physics of planet formation may be understood. The exoplanet community has co-opted the term 'architecture' to embody several properties of planetary systems such as multiplicity and orbital parameters like eccentricities (e), inclinations (i orb ), semi-major axes (a) and orbital periods. The distributions of individual planetary properties like masses and radii (M p and R p , respectively) may also be included in this term. The primary goal of the Apache Point Observatory Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets (APOSTLE) is to catalog transit lightcurves at high precision, in order to (1) measure system parameters, and (2) look for transit timing variations that may indicate the presence of additional planets.</p><p>The transit technique applies to those systems where the orbital inclination of an exoplanet is close to 90 • (i.e. edge-on) with respect to the observer's sky-plane (see discovery paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Charbonneau et al. 2000)</ref>. In this case, the observer sees a u-shaped dip in the starlight caused when the planet eclipses the star <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Winn 2011</ref>). The objective of several ground-based and space-based efforts focused on transit observations is to catalog and improve measurements of system parameters, which in-turn gives us an improved picture of the architecture of the planetary system. This process is key toward developing theories of planet formation that can adequately explain the origin and evolution of all planetary systems (including our own).</p><p>The APOSTLE target XO-2b is a Hot-Jupiter on a 2.6 day orbit around an early type K dwarf (V = 11.2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. 2007</ref>). The planet is known to have a mass of 0.555 M Jup and a radius of 0.992 R Jup (Southworth 2010). The system is not known to have any other planet-mass objects. Transit timing measurements from the ground are consistent with a linear ephemeris ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fernandez et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crouzet et al. 2012)</ref>, although the cited studies note that there are statistically significant deviations in the measurement of the orbital periods. A search for additional eclipses using the EPOXI mission by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballard et al. (2011)</ref> had inconclusive results since the eclipse was not fully sampled. Spitzer observations of the secondary eclipse of XO-2b show IRAC 3.6, 4.5 and 5.8 µm fluxes which are consistent with the presence of a temperature inversion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Machalek et al. 2009</ref>). There have also been detections of optical absorbers in the planetary atmosphere such as potassium from narrow band optical transmission spectrophotometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sing et al. 2011</ref>). Early theoretical studies indicated that stellar insolation levels directly influenced the presence or absence of a thermal inversion layer (depending on the survival of atmospheric absorbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>). The planetary atmosphere classification system developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. (2008)</ref> places XO-2b in an transition zone between planets with (pM) and without (pL) thermal inversions. XO-2b is one of a handful of Hot-Jupiters in this region. However, observational evidence suggests ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Machalek et al. 2008</ref>) that more complicated models need to be considered. Irradiation from stellar activity may need to be included ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. 2010</ref>) and atmospheric chemistry may also need to be considered to provide a more complete picture <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Madhusudhan 2012</ref>). The host star of the XO-2 system is known to be a high metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.45 ± 0.02), high proper motion star (µ Tot = 157 mas/yr) in a visual binary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. 2007</ref>). Spectral activity indices show that XO-2 is fairly inactive compared to other stars of similar spectral type ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>A primary goal of APOSTLE and other campaigns that monitor transiting exoplanets is to search for TTVs that reveal the presence of unseen companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Holman &amp; Murray 2005)</ref>. In principle, Earth-mass planets in or near mean motion resonances could perturb the orbit of the transiting planet enough to produce a sinusoidal oscillation in the mid-points of transits. However, the full range of stable orbits that can produce a detectable TTV signal has never been explored. The detection of TTVs by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (e.g. Holman et al. 2010</ref>) has demonstrated that stable systems are capable of producing TTVs, and other studies have explored a limited range of architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Haghighipour &amp; Kirste 2011</ref>), but the systematic exploration of parameter space of an Earth-mass planet in orbit near a hot Jupiter has not been undertaken. Here we examine 3.6 million possible masses and orbits of an approximately Earth-mass planet orbiting in or near the 2:1 outer mean motion resonance through N-body simulations. We find that stable orbits that also produce detectable TTVs do exist in the XO-2 system, and hence can exist in similar Hot-Jupiter systems.</p><p>In this paper we report observations of 10 transits of XO-2b, taken as part of APOSTLE. In § 2 we outline our observations. In § 3 we briefly outline (i) the data reduction, photometry ( § 3.1), (ii) the transit model ( § 3.2) and lightcurve fitting ( § 3.3); both processes have also been described in previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. 2013</ref>). In § 4 we present our estimates of the system parameters for XO-2b and in the subsections § 4.1 and § 4.2 we present results from our study of transit depth variations (TDVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs). In § 5 we present results form N-body simulations used to study the stability of hypothetical planetary configurations at the 2:1 mean-motions resonance. Finally, in § 6 we summarize our findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>XO-2b was observed by members of the APOSTLE team on 10 occasions over a timespan of 3 years from early 2008 until the spring of 2011. All observations of XO-2 were carried out using Agile, a high-speed frame-transfer CCD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mukadam et al. 2011</ref>), on the ARC 1 3.5m telescope at Apache Point, New Mexico. The summary of observations is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>. XO-2 was an early APOSTLE target and was observed using a variety of instrumental settings, as the team had not converged on an optimal observing strategy prior to 2010. Early observations were made in the I-band (λ 0 = 805nm, Cousins 1976; Bessell 1990) with several data sets taken with short read-out (exposure times, Column (5) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The short readout mode allowed for fine sampling of the lightcurve, but due to the lower signal-to-noise and the unsuitability for characterizing systematics, this observing mode was abandoned. In addition, the I-band images also contained a strong contribution from a fringe pattern due interference from the backscattering of atmospheric lines within the CCD's pixels. The removal of this fringe pattern is discussed in § 3.1. Early in 2010, the observing strategy changed to longer readouts (typically 45-75 seconds) to reduce the level of correlated noise (red-noise), and were made using the r ′ -band which is similar to the SDSS 2 r filter (λ 0 = 626nm, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fukugita et al. 1996)</ref>, to reduce the influence of fringes. In the long read-out mode the telescope was defocused to spread the stellar point-spread function (PSF) across multiple pixels, which minimized the systematics caused by pixel-to-pixel wandering of the PSF over the imperfect flatfield. The longer exposures also allowed for a greater count rate which maximized the signal-to-noise per image. The count rate was kept below Agile's non-linearity limit of ∼52k ADU and well below its saturation level of 61k ADU by small adjustments to the telescope's secondary focus during observations. XO-2 (TYC 3413-5-1) and its visual binary companion TYC 3413-210-1 (separated by ∼ 30") were the only bright stars that fit in Agile's field of view. Both stars are of identical spectral type (K0V) and nearly identical brightnesses in the filters used by APOSTLE, with their Johnson R and I magnitudes at 10.8 and 10.5 respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Monet et al. 2003</ref>). Our uncalibrated differential photometry also showed good agreement in their brightnesses, with the out-of-eclipse, un-normalized flux ratios being different by only 4% and 3% in the Iband and r ′ -band, respectively (Column 'Flux Norm.' in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The observations were made over a variety of observing conditions (Column 'Obs. Conditions' in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The observing conditions are classified as 'Clear' or 'Poor Weather' with the former implying good data with few or no interruptions in data collection, and the latter indicating that the we experienced cloud cover or poor seeing conditions resulting in lower quality data. The tabulated transits are those for which we were able to capture the whole transit or at least a partial transit. Partial transits are those where portions of the in-eclipse lightcurve were lost due to bad weather or instrumental failure. Several data points were lost for the nights of UTD 2008-09-22 (#4), 2009-02-06 (#5), 2009-03-12 (#6) and 2010-12-27 (#8). However we do include these nights since we did manage to obtain reasonable portions of the in-eclipse and out-of-eclipse data, which make it possible to determine transit properties (albeit at a loss of accuracy and precision).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Analysis</head><p>This section outlines various stages in the analysis of lightcurves, starting with (i) the image reduction and photometry, and (ii) the transit model and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyzer (see also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Reduction &amp; Photometry</head><p>APOSTLE data were reduced using a pipeline developed specifically for Agile images. The pipeline (written in IDL 3 ) performs pixel-by-pixel error propagation, and image processing specific to the Agile CCD. In addition to the standard photometric reduction steps like dark subtraction and flat-fielding, the pipeline performs non-linearity and fringe corrections specific to Agile. The details on Agile's non-linearity correction are described in § 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. (2013)</ref>. Some of the initial observations by APOSTLE were carried out using short exposures (see Column (5) 'Exp.') in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We binned these data by averaging the flux ratios in 45 sec bins.</p><p>For several of the initial XO-2 data taken using Agile's I-band, a fringe pattern had to be subtracted to create science images. Photons from strong atmospheric lines (in the I-band bandpass) backscatter within the CCD pixels, and owing to the variable thickness of the pixel array, interference between these photons creates the fringe pattern. Since the fringe pattern is convolved with the illumination pattern of the CCD, the fringe correction has to be applied after dark-subtraction and flat-fielding. During the initial characterization of the Agile CCD, an empirical fringe frame was produced by median combining dithered frames on the dark sky, where the flux contributions from stars were removed by outlier rejection. The resulting combined frame served as a "Model" fringe pattern (F ), normalized to have a median of zero, and an amplitude of one, such that it could be scaled to match the fringe patterns on science frames. The science frame affected by the fringe pattern (T ′ ) is assumed to be a linear combination of the fringe-less science image (T ) and a fringe pattern:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T ′ = T + a 0 F (1)</formula><p>where F is the model fringe frame and a 0 is a scaling factor describing the amplitude of the fringing on a given frame. The fringe amplitude is estimated by minimizing χ 2 and fitting for a 0 in the above model. The corrected images (T = T ′ − a 0 F ), were found to be sufficiently corrected of fringes after visual examination. We found the fringe amplitudes (a 0 ) on XO-2 science frames to always be smaller than the standard deviation (i.e. scatter) of the global sky background on each frame; a 0 ranged between 6-13% of the scatter in the sky for XO-2 data.</p><p>We extracted photometry from an optimal circular aperture centered around the target and comparison stars. In addition we extracted the counts on image products like the master-dark and master-flat, to serve as nuisance parameters for detrending, using the same aperture and centroids from photometry. The centroids were derived using SExtractor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996)</ref>, which allowed for the use of customized donut-shaped convolution kernels for defocused PSFs. Science frames where pixels inside a photometric aperture exceeded Agile's saturation limit of 61k were rejected. Images at the other extreme, where the stars were obscured by clouds, and resulted in low signal to noise measurements were also rejected (i.e. where individual photometric errors were &gt; 5000 ppm). The fraction of rejected frames per night is listed in Column (9) '%Rej.' in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The optimal aperture was selected after extracting photometry on a list of circular apertures with radii between 5-50 pixels at an interval of 1 pixel. The optimal aperture was selected where the scatter in the residuals of the detrended lightcurve minus a trial transit model (based on values from the literature) was minimized. The correction function F cor (or detrending function) is modeled as a linear sum of nuisance parameters as described by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F cor,i = Nnus k=1 c k X k,i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where X k,i are the nuisance parameters, c k are the corresponding coefficients. The index k counts over the number of nuisance parameters N nus . The detrending coefficients are chosen by minimizing the χ 2 between the observed data (O), a model function (M) and the correction function,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ 2 = N all j (O j − M j − F cor,j ) 2 σ 2 j (3)</formula><p>here j is the index which counts over the total number of data points (N all ). The observed, model and correction function terms are all in normalized flux ratio units. The list of parameters used for detrending each lightcurve in the XO-2 dataset are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, with variable definitions given in the footnotes. A suitable set of detrending parameters were selected for a given night by running several manual trials of linear least squares minimization on single transit lightcurves and its corresponding model lightcurve and correction function (Eq. 2). The model parameters were fixed at reasonable values and only the coefficients (c k ) were fit. Those nuisance parameters which returned large uncertainties on the coefficients were excluded since this indicated a poor match to the noise trend in a lightcurve. This method of selecting nuisance parameters is admittedly ad-hoc; automated parameter selection techniques could be applied in the future. The detrending is performed using the final set of nuisance parameters in conjunction with fitting the transit parameters in order to ensure that the correction process is not biased by the trial model used in the selection of nuisance parameters.</p><p>-8 -    The 10 transits of XO-2b are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> in normalized flux ratios (with offsets for clarity). The plotted data result from the data reduction and model fitting processes described in sections § 3.1, § 3.2 and § 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">MultiTransitQuick</head><p>We developed a transit model called MultiTransitQuick (MTQ) in PYTHON, which is based on the analytic lightcurve models presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>, and the PYTHON implementation of some of its functions (from EXOFAST by <ref type="bibr">Eastman et al. 2012</ref>). The description of MTQ used for this study is described in some detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. (2013)</ref>. MultiTransitQuick can be used to (1) fit for transit depths for data taken with multiple filters (Multi-Filter model), or (2) fit each transit depth individually (Multi-Depth).</p><p>The set of parameters used for Multi-Filter version of MTQ is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">θ Multi-Filter = {t T , t G , D j...N F , v 1,j...N F , v 2,j...N F , T i...N T },</formula><p>where t T is transit duration, t G is the limb-crossing duration and T i are the mid-transit times. The filter dependent parameters include the transit depth D j and the limb-darkening parameters v 1,j and v 2,j described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. (2013)</ref>. The subscripts i...N T and j...N F are used to denote multiple transits (N T ) and multiple filters (N F ) respectively. The XO-2 data were gathered using the I-band and r ′ -band, where N F was 2 and the number of transits N T was 10.</p><p>The parameter set is only slightly different for the Multi-Depth version, with θ Multi-Depth</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= {t T , t G , D i...N T , v 1,j...N F , v 2,j...N F , T i.</formula><p>..N T }; the difference being the transit depth is now fit for each transit separately instead of each filter. The filters are still tracked to ensure the use of the correct limb-darkening parameters for each lightcurve. A single lightcurve is set as the "reference" lightcurve and used to internally compute several orbital parameters. For the XO-2 data set we used # 3 since it had few gaps, and had the best photometric precision among the I-band lightcurves. We did not use an r ′ -band lightcurve as a reference since this filter is more affected by limb-darkening when compared to the I-band and hence estimates of the planet-to-star size ratio (R p /R ⋆ ) (used in the computation of orbital parameters) may be susceptible to degeneracies. Using the Multi-Depth model aids in understanding transit depth variations over multiple epochs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Transit MCMC</head><p>We developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyzer called Transit MCMC (TMCMC), based on the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gelman et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tegmark et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ford 2005)</ref>, with an adaptive step-size modifier <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Collier Cameron et al. 2007</ref>). MCMC routines quantify the uncertainty distributions of model parameters (given the data) using Bayes' theorem, by sampling parameter space such that samples from high probability regions (low χ 2 ) are selected at a greater rate than those from low probability regions. The final ensemble of sampled points the MCMC routine typically represent the uncertainty distributions of the model parameters. One must note that adaptive MCMCs are generally not considered to be truly Markovian in nature and their results are valid only if adaptation diminishes with time <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Roberts &amp; Rosenthal 2009)</ref>; a property that our chains do display.</p><p>For APOSTLE data sets, we explored system parameters using three different kinds of chains. Two of these were based on the Multi-Filter parameter set θ Multi-Filter described in § 3.2 and third used the Multi-Depth parameter set (θ Multi-Depth ). The two Multi-Filter chains used Fixed Limb-Darkening Coefficients (LDC) and Open Limb-Darkening Coefficients (OLDC). For the Fixed LDC chains (FLDC), the coefficients were simply fixed to values tabulated for the appropriate observing filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Claret &amp; Bloemen 2011</ref>). For the Open LDC chains, the limb-darkening parameters v 1 and v 2 , for both I-band and r ′ -band data, are allowed to float. The ability to constrain stellar limb-darkening requires high precision data, such as those collected using the HST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brown et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>). Previous attempts to fit for limb-darkening on APOSTLE data have resulted in Markov chains that failed to converge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kundurthy et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. , 2013</ref>. The third type of Markov chain was run on the Multi-Depth parameter set θ Multi-Depth described in § 3.2. APOSTLE lightcurves were gathered over a long time-baseline, and statistically significant depth variations seen in the data may help shed light on the various phenomena responsible for depth variations (see § 3.2), or point to limitations in the data and model. Several of the preliminary steps for executing a chain using TMCMC are described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kundurthy et al. 2013</ref>). These steps include (1) setting bounds and (2) running short single-parameter exploratory chains to determine a set of suitable starting jump-sizes for the long Markov Chains. We ran long chains of 2 × 10 6 steps from two different starting locations for each model scenario: Fixed LDC, Open LDC and Multi-Depth/Fixed LDC. After completion we (1) cropped the initial stages of these chains to remove the burn-in phase, where the chain is far from the best-fit region, and (2) we exclude the stage where the chain is far from the optimal acceptance rate of 23± 5% (as noted for multi-parameter chains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gelman et al. 2003</ref>). We run three types of post-processing on the chains after cropping: (a) We compute the ranked and unranked correlations in the chains of every fit parameter with respect to the others. These statistics provide an estimate of the level of degeneracy between parameters in a given model. The next post-processing steps are two commonly used diagnostics to check for chain convergence, namely (b) computing the autocorrelation lengths and (c) the Gelman-RubinˆRRubinˆ RubinˆR-static values <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gelman &amp; Rubin 1992</ref>). The auto-correlation lengths determine the scale over which a chain has local trends. From the auto-correlation length one can compute the effective length as the total chain length divided by the auto-correlation length, which represents the statistical significance with which the uncertainty distribution was sampled. A large effective length (&gt; 1000) represents a wellsampled distribution. Thê R-statistic represents the level of coverage the chain has over the parameter space. When parameter space has been properly sampled thê R-statistic computed using chains from different starting locations will be close to 1. We deem those chains as coverged that have an effective length &gt; 1000 and anˆRanˆ anˆR-statistic within 10% of 1.</p></div>

For transit timing studies, poor estimates such as these are cause for concern, since smaller errors and large deviations from the expected time can easily lead to false claims of TTVs. Since TMCMC does not include red-noise analysis we run fits on APOSTLE lightcurves using TAP as a check to the results derived from TMCMC.</p><p>The typical TAP parameter set is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">θ TAP = {a/R ⋆ , i orb , (R p /R ⋆ ) i...N F , T i...N T , σ (white,i...N T ) , σ (red,i...N T )</formula><p>}, where a/R ⋆ , i orb and (R p /R ⋆ ) are the commonly fit transit parameters denoting the semi-major axis (in stellar radius units), the orbital inclination and the planet-to-star radius ratio, respectively. The noise analysis parameters σ (white,i...N T ) and σ (red,i...N T ) are the white-noise and red-noise levels for N T transits respectively. The TAP package does not fit for the period using the transit times, and often yields poor estimates of the period, so we fixed the period to the value derived from TMCMC. The limb-darkening was fixed to values from the literature. The orbital eccentricity (e) and argument of periastron were kept fixed at 0 for XO-2b.</p></div>

Post processing statistics and other data for these chains are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. The columns 'N free ', 'Chain Length', 'Corr. Length' and 'Eff. Length' list the number of free parameters, the length of the cropped chain, the correlation and effective lengths, respectively. All chains were run for approximately 2 Million steps, but about 100,000 of the initial steps were removed to account for "burnin" and selection rate stabilization. The XO-2b chain with Open LDC has a low effective length indicating poor Markov chain statistics. The Fixed LDC chains (both θ Multi-Filter and θ Multi-Depth ) model satisfy the condition of a well sampled posterior distribution (effective length is &gt; 1000).

In addition APOSTLE's measurements give tighter constraints on several of the system parameters. The errors on a/R ⋆ , i orb , the impact parameter (b) and the stellar density (ρ ⋆ ) are more precise than previous measurements by a factor of ∼3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fernandez et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sing et al. 2011</ref>). However, previous studies using the combination of the TMCMC Markov chain analyzer and MTQ transit model have resulted in underestimated errors since we do not include rednoise analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carter &amp; Winn 2009)</ref>. Hence, the errors presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> do not truly reflect improvements in the measurements of parameters. More conservative constraints were placed on a subset of these system parameters using the TAP package. Comparisons of some parameters and their uncertainties are presented in 7. It is clear that using TAP on the APOSTLE dataset and accounting for rednoise provides more conservative estimates of the system parameters when compared to TMCMC values. TAP errors for a/R ⋆ and ρ ⋆ are better than those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sing et al. (2011)</ref> by upto ∼40%; whose observations were made using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). One must note the Sing et al. (2011) data result from narrow-band photometry and hence would have much lower photometric precision when compared to broadband observations from the same telescope. The resulting TAP errors for the impact parameter (b) and the orbital inclination are larger than those from the GTC study by ∼ 20%. Thus we report only some improvements in the measurements of system parameters. Our system parameters agree with the current best estimates reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crouzet et al. (2012)</ref>, but our error bars are larger by factors ≤ 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows transit depth vs. transit epoch for the I-band (top panel) and r ′ -band (bottom panel). The overall variations in the I-band depth are ∼ 0.05% compared to the 0.01% uncertainty in D (I) from the joint fit to depths in the Fixed LDC chain. Depth variations can be caused by spots. Even though the variations we present are significant we refrain from claiming the detection of spot-modulation. These deviations are likely due to the incomplete sampling of several transits. Spots influence stellar brightness to a greater extent at shorter wavelengths, so the r ′ -band would be more conducive to showing depth variations. However, the overall depth variation in the r ′ -band lightcurves is of the order 0.01% and is consistent with the errors on D (r ′ ) from the fit reported by the Fixed LDC chain ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>). The variations seen in the I-band depths are difficult to exaplin. They can either be due to (1) real brightness variations caused by spot-modulations, or (2) variations arising from the transit model's inability to accurately constrain transit depths and errors given the incomplete sampling of lightcurves (like Transit # 4, 5 and 6). We note that errors on the transit depth from our Multi-Depth LDC chains are more sensitive to the incompleteness of in-eclipse data rather than the photometric precision of a given lightcurve. For example, transit numbers #4 and #6 have 86% and 72% of the in-eclipse transit data sampled respectively; they also have lightcurve residuals of 939ppm and 405ppm respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Transit Depth Analysis</head><p>So even though # 6 has significantly better photometric precision, the depth for # 4 is constrained slightly better due to the fact that more in-eclipse points are available. A more dramatic difference can be seen with transit #5, which has only 47% of the in-eclipse lightcurve sampled and the worst depth constraint. Other than #5 all transits have eclipses sampled to better than 70%, hence the depth uncertainties are all comparable. Even though the Multi-Depth LDC chain satisified the convergence criteria described in § 3.3, the effective length of the chain is far lesser than the value derived for the Multi-Filter LDC chain (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>), indicating the lower significance of these MCMC results. In addition one must note the lack of rednoise analysis in TMCMC, which implies that the errors presented <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> are probably underestimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Transit Timing Analysis</head><p>Several planetary systems have been observed to have Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Holman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballard et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2012</ref>). In certain configurations these variations can be on the order of minutes and can be easily seen in an diagram showing observed minus computed transit times (i.e. the difference between the measured times and times expected from purely Keplerian orbital periods). Using TTVs to look for additional planets was first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Holman &amp; Murray (2005)</ref>, who showed that unseen planetary siblings can gravitationally influence the orbits of a known transiting planet. The TTV signals are known to be especially strong if the unseen companion lies close to mean motion resonance with the transiting planet.</p><p>Available transit times from the literature for XO-2b include those of the discovery paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. (2007)</ref>, and the follow-up observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fernandez et al. (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sing et al. (2011) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Crouzet et al. (2012)</ref>. We excluded the 11 transit times from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke et al. (2007)</ref> since the reported timing errors were on the order of ∼ 3min, and are too large to provide meaningful constraints on the orbital ephemeris. We do include transit times from the other three studies. The time coordinate BJD (TDB) has become the standard system used for transit timing studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eastman et al. 2010</ref>) and all transit times used in this study were brought to this system. The timestamps of all APOSTLE data were converted to BJD (TDB) in the customized reduction pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kundurthy et al. 2011</ref>). The APOSTLE pipeline's time conversions have been verified by comparison to the commonly used time conversion routines made available by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Eastman et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The observed minus computed mid-transit times (O-C) are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. There are two versions of APOSTLE transit times presented, one from the Fixed LDC chain (TMCMC + MTQ), and the other from the TAP fit to APOSTLE lightcurves. These transit times are  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>. A linear ephemeris was fit to all the data (including literature values) using the equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">T i = T 0 + Epoch i × P<label>(4)</label></formula><p>resulting in a best fit ephemeris of, In order to compare the ephemerides derived with and without rednoise analysis, we fit for a linear ephemeris to the APOSTLE transit times from TMCMC and TAP respectively  <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>). The difference between the periods derived for these subsets and the period derived from all available transit times was &lt; 7 milli-seconds. The results from the fits to the TMCMC and TAP transit times are presented at the bottom of <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>. The reduced χ 2 s for linear ephemeris fits to the TMCMC and TAP subsets were 3.96 and 1.26 respectively, confirming that TAP gives more conservative errors for the transit times thanks to the rednoise analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P</formula><p>We were also able to rule out sinusoidal trends in the data by running a generalized lomb-scargle analysis on the O-C data <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zechmeister &amp; Kürster 2009)</ref>. We fit for a period, amplitude and phase offset on two sets of O-C data. The first set included the literature dataset and all APOSTLE measurements, and the second included only the TAP measurements of APOSTLE. We found that a sinusoid of period ∼ 19 days and amplitude of ∼ 32 seconds improved the fit when the entire timing data set was used. The sinusoid fit yielded a χ 2 =81.8, which was an improvement of ∆χ 2 = 23.3 compared to the linear ephemeris (see above). However, the reduced χ 2 remains greater than 1, making it a non-robust fit. The periodogram analysis on only the TAP data, yielded a period and amplitude of 8.5 days and 27.4 seconds respectively. The ∆χ 2 showed improvement compared to the linear ephemeris model by ∼7.6. In a manner similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Becker et al. (2013)</ref> we tested the significance of this sinusoidal fit by repeating the analysis on 10 5 randomly cycled permutations of the amplitudes of the O-C measurements, keeping the epochs fixed. We found that 76.7% of the fits showed improved ∆χ 2 at amplitudes greater than or equal to 27.4 seconds, indicating that the periodicity is not likely from a real TTV.</p><p>For the case when planets are in mean-motion resonance (MMR), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref> showed that the analytic expression, δt max ∼ P 4.5j</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">mpert (mpert+mtrans)</formula><p>, can roughly estimate the amplitude of the timing deviation (δt max ). The quantities m pert , m trans , P and j are the mass of the unseen perturber, the mass of the transiting planet, the orbital period of the transiting planet and the order of the resonance respectively. For the XO-2 system, we can rule out possible system configurations given the amplitude of the weak sinusoidal fit to the TTV data (∼ 27.4 sec). Using the orbital period from <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref> and the mass of XO-2b, m trans = 0.565 M Jup ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fernandez et al. 2009</ref>), we compute the maximum mass perturber that could exist in the XO-2 system in the 2:1 MMR to be ∼ 0.2M ⊕ , i.e. additional planets with M p &lt; 0.2 M ⊕ may exist near the 2:1 MMR given these data. At higher order resonances, this maximum mass (for a possible perturber) is larger. A more detailed analysis of TTV needs to account for a variety of orbital configurations of hypothetical companions, which is addressed in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">System Dynamics</head><p>In order to evaluate the stability of systems that produce a detectable TTV, we integrated 3.6 × 10 6 orbital configurations designed to mimic the XO-2 system.

In this table ∆ is the interval between values, all of which were varied uniformly in the range between "Min" and "Max," producing N bins. In this table, m is mass of the hypothetical terrestrial exoplanet, e is eccentricity, i orb is the orbital inclination measured from the plane perpendicular to the sky, Ω is the longitude of ascending node, ω is the argument of pericenter, and M is the mean anomaly. Since our timing precisions are at the level of a signal from a terrestrial planet, we limited the mass coverage to the "super-Earth" range of 1 -10 M ⊕ planets. Our semi-major axis coverage spans the 2:1 resonance, with one choice directly at the commensurability. All other parameters were varied so as to fully cover all possible architectures, but still to keep the entire program tractable.

We integrated each trial for 10 6 orbits of XO-2b (∼ 7200 years), which is enough to identify &gt; 95% of unstable orbits for other exoplanet system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnes &amp; Quinn 2004</ref>). Each simulation could produce one of three outcomes: stable, unstable, or fail. Stable configurations lost no planets due to gravitational perturbations, while unstable ones did. Failed systems did not conserve energy to better than 1 part in 10 4 , which is required for symplectic integrators <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnes &amp; Quinn 2004</ref>).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, a sample slice through the data set is shown. We limited the visualization to cases with m ∼ 1 M ⊕ planets with i orb = Ω = ω = 0, and M = 144 • . Green squares designate stable configurations, red unstable, and yellow failed. Most simulations from the yellow bins are probably unstable, as close approaches between planets can violate the algorithm's underlying assumption that the gravitational force from the star is much larger than that from any other planet.

For the broad stable region at e 0.1, the signal is at or below the detection limit. For larger e, especially in the resonance, the value can be much larger. For the bin at a = 0.0587 AU, and e = 0.7, the signal magnitude is close to 2377 sec, or nearly 40 minutes. Clearly, the APOSTLE project could have detected an Earth-mass companion if it were in a favorable orbit. We do note, however, that an Earth-like planet with large eccentricity is likely to be rapidly tidally circularized due to the close proximity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rasio et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jackson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes et al. 2010</ref>), although some eccentricity would be maintained by the resonance.</p><p>As noted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 8 ( § 4.</ref>2) the median TTV errors obtained from APOSTLE lightcurves of XO-2b were ∼20 sec. Of the 3.6 million parameter configurations, ∼ 1.14 million were found to be stable, and approximately 51% of these stable configurations produce TTVs on the order of 20 sec or less and thus would not be easily detected by APOSTLE or other surveys with similar capability. The vast amount of data generated by the stability simulations cannot be adequetly discussed in this text, hence we provide the results from all 3.6 Million simulations as part of an online-only table; a segment of which is displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>.

The seen variations could be shortcomings of the transit model's -28 -    ability to fit a set of lightcurves with both complete and incomplete data. We do not see similar variations in the r ′ -band, where one may expect spot-modulated variability to appear, due to the greater spot-to-star contrast in the r ′ -band.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Search for Transit Timing Variations:</head><p>The XO-2b dataset contains lightcurves with some of the best photometric precisions achieved with ground-based observations. Since photometric precision directly translates to transit timing precision we are able to report timing precisions as low as 12 sec (after red-noise analysis, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>). We were unable to detect significant timing deviations for XO-2b in our data. The linear fit was not robust, with χ 2 /DOF being significantly greater than 1, indicating large scatter around the linear ephemeris fit. The transit times derived from the APOSTLE lightcurves using the red-noise analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carter &amp; Winn (2009)</ref> resulted in more conservative errors than those derived using TMCMC. A linear ephemeris is consistent with the transit time measurements reported from the TAP analysis. The overall variation in the O-C values from our rednoise analysis was on the order of ∼ 39 sec. From a sinusoidal fit to APOSTLE's O-C data, we obtained a TTV amplitude of ∼ 27.4 sec. However, checking the goodness-of-fit of sinusoids to random rearrangements of the data show that the detected periodicity unlikely to be real. The resulting amplitude rules out planetary companions more massive than 0.2 M ⊕ near the 2:1 MMR, and larger companions near higher order resonances.</p><p>We conclude that the set of transit times published in the literature for XO-2b and other transiting systems in general, are not suited for transit timing analysis. Lacking rednoise analysis leads to underestimated timing errors and may lead to premature reporting of timing variations. A proper analysis of transit times would need a simultaneous analysis of transit lightcurves using a transit model which is, (1) suited for Bayesian inference (i.e. with a fairly uncorrelated parameter set, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carter et al. 2008)</ref> and (2) a transit model which can adequately account for red-noise in the data (like TAP, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gazak et al. 2011</ref>). Using large data sets of transit lightcurves may be inefficient due to the slowness of Markov chains with the addition of model parameters. In addition to the development of more detailed models the utilization of fast Markov chain algorithms (for e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2012</ref>) is also recommended.</p><p>Our lack of detection of TTVs in the data for the Hot-Jupiter XO-2b is also consistent with Kepler 's findings that (1) Hot-Jupiters tend to lack other planetary siblings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Steffen et al. 2012</ref>) and (2) members of multi-planet systems with short period planets (Period &lt; 10 days) are more likely to be Hot-Neptunes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2011b</ref>).</p><p>V.

The reduced chi-squared χ 2 /ν = 3.39 indicates that the linear fit is not robust, and is either due to the large timing deviations in the data or underestimated errors. For example, several of the Sing et al. (2011) data points lie far from the zero O-C line, with the largest deviation being ∼ 106 sec. The scatter in the O-C values as a whole is ∼ 39 sec which makes the 106 sec deviation fall within the 3σ confidence interval of the collective data set. Though the linear ephemeris does not precisely fit the timing data, the level of variation is not significant enough for us to claim unseen planets as the cause.</figDesc></figure>
