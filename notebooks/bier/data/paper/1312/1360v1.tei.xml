			<abstract>
				<p>We present narrow-band photometric measurements of the exoplanet GJ 1214b using the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the OSIRIS instrument. Using tune-able filters we observed a total of five transits, three of which were observed at two wavelengths nearly simultaneously, producing a total of eight individual light curves, six of these probed the possible existence of a methane absorption feature in the 8770-8850Å8850Å region at high resolution. We detect no increase in the planet-to-star radius ratio across the methane feature with a change in radius ratio of ∆R = −0.0007 ± 0.0017 corresponding to a scale height (H) change of −0.5±1.2 H across the methane feature, assuming a hydrogen dominated atmosphere. We find a variety of water and cloudy atmospheric models fit the data well, but find that cloud-free models provide poor fits. These observations support a flat transmission spectrum resulting from the presence of a high-altitude haze or a water-rich atmosphere, in agreement with previous studies. In this study the observations are predominantly limited by the photomet-ric quality and the limited number of data points (resulting from a long observing cadence), which make the determination of the systematic noise challenging. With tuneable filters capable of high resolution measurements (R ≈ 600-750) of narrow absorption features, the interpretation of our results are also limited by the absence of high resolution methane models below 1 µm.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>Photometric observations of GJ 1214b were conducted using the GTC telescope on La Palma. For all observations, we used the tuneable filter (TF) imaging mode on OSIRIS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cepa et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cepa et al. , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cepa 1998</ref>) to acquire photometry within a bandpass of 12Å12Å. The TF imager allows for custom bandpasses with a central wavelength between 651-934.5 nm and a FWHM of 12-20Å20Å to be specified.</p><p>Out of the five transits observed, three transits were observed in the 8770 -8850Åregion8850Åregion by alternating between two narrow bandpasses, each with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 12Å12Å, allowing us to perform near simultaneous photometry at two wavelengths. Observing one transit at two wavelengths simultaneously allows for a more accurate comparison between two wavelengths as systematic variations caused by varying weather conditions or stellar activity are likely to affect both light curves similarly. For the observations done at two wavelengths we specifically chose our bandpasses so that one was located in the continuum, at a shorter wavelength of 8770Å8770Å and 8784.5 ˚ A compared to the other band located at 8835Å8835Å and 8849.6 ˚ A, within the methane absorption band. As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Colón et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sing et al. (2011)</ref>, another property of the TF imaging mode is that the effective wavelength decreases radially outward from the optical center, so we attempted to position the target and a single "primary" reference star (i.e., one most comparable in brightness to the target) at the same distance from the optical center so as to observe both stars at the same wavelengths. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The other reference stars were thus observed at slightly different wavelengths than the target, due to their different distances from the optical center.</p><p>All observations were performed with 1 × 1 binning and a fast pixel readout rate of 500 kHz, a gain of 1.46 e − /ADU and a read noise of ∼ 8 e − as well as a single window located on one CCD chip. The size of the window varied for each observation, but was chosen to be large enough so as to contain the target and several reference stars of similar brightness. Data points with analog-to-digital unit (ADU) counts larger than 45,000 were removed to ensure the measurements were taken in the linear regime of the CCD detector. The data presented in this paper originated from two separate observing programs by PI. D. Sing (ESO program 182.C-2018 see §2.1 and §2.2) and PI. K. Colón (GTC2-10AFLO and GTC4-11AFLO see §2.3, §2.4 and §2.5) and each had slightly different observing strategies. Further details regarding each specific transit observation are given in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">8100Å8100Å Transit, 17 August 2010</head><p>Observations of the 2010 August 17 transit were tuned to a target wavelength of 8100Å8100Å, with the target 3.7 arc minutes away from the optical centre. The observations began at 21:18 UT and ended at 23:29 UT, during which time the airmass ranged from 1.11 to 1.44. Due to variable seeing, ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 ′′ , the telescope was defocused to avoid saturation. Two reference stars were selected (more on the selection technique in §3). The observations were windowed using a 1160×760 pixel section on CCD1. Twelve images containing counts greater than 45 000 ADU were removed to ensure linearity. The exposure time was kept at 60 s throughout the sequence, with a corresponding ∼12 s of readout time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">8550Å8550Å Transit, 2 June 2010</head><p>Observations of the 2010 June 2 transit were tuned to a target wavelength of 8550Å8550Å, with the target 1.3 arc minutes from the optical centre. The observations began at 23:48 UT and ended at 03:04 UT, during which time the airmass ranged from 1.27 to 1.87. Due to a technical problem with the secondary mirror, re-focusing was not possible during the whole sequence. This caused an increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the stars from 0.9 to 1.9 ′′ , resulting in a notable decrease in the peak counts levels. Three reference stars were selected. The observations were performed using CCD1 and no windowing was done. One data point with counts greater than 45 000 ADU was removed to ensure linearity (see § 3). The exposure time was kept at 120 s throughout the sequence, with a corresponding ∼24.5 s of readout time for the full frame.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">8770 and 8835Å8835Å Transit, 28 August 2010</head><p>Observations of the 2010 August 28 transit were tuned to the target wavelengths of 8770 and 8835Å8835Å, with the target 3.2 arc minutes from the optical centre. The observations were done by alternating between the two wavelengths in sets of two exposures at each wavelength. The seeing was variable throughout the observations, so the telescope was defocused and the exposure time was changed to avoid saturation. The observations were done in queue (service) mode. The exposure time started at 100 s and was later increased to 150 s and then to 200 s towards the end of the observations. The observations began at 22:00 UT and ended at 00:30 UT, during which time the airmass ranged from 1.26 to 2.32 and the FWHM varied between 1.0 to 2.6 ′′ . There are some small gaps in the data towards the beginning of the observations due to minor technical issues. Also, there is some vignetting in the last few images due to the low elevation of the telescope, so we exclude these from our analysis. Two reference stars were selected. Two data points with counts greater than 45 000 ADU were removed to ensure linearity. The observations were windowed using a 850×4102 pixel section on CCD2 with a corresponding ∼22 s of readout time. The small bump seen towards the front of the larger PSF is due to one of the hexagonal mirrors not being properly aligned. By choosing a larger photometry aperture, the effects caused by the distorted PSF were removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">8770 and 8835Å8835Å Transit, 10 June 2011</head><p>Observations of the 2011 June 11 transit were tuned to the target wavelengths of 8770 and 8835Å8835Å, with the target 3.2 arc minutes from the optical centre. The observations were done by alternating between the two wavelengths in sets of two exposures at each wavelength. The conditions were clear, and observations took place during bright time in visitor mode. Observations began at 23:40 UT and ended at 02:48 UT, during which time the airmass ranged from 1.09 to 1.19 and the FWHM varied between 1.3 and 2.2 ′′ . The observations started 25 min later than planned because one of the M1 mirror segments was found to be slightly misaligned (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). One segment of the mirror would not stack with the other segments. Attempts were made to correct this, although the problem persisted throughout the observations. As this problem had the same effect on all the stars (i.e., each star had an extended PSF, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), we have assumed the photometry was not significantly affected by this problem since we chose a larger aperture that included the photons from the unstacked segment. Three reference stars were selected. The observations were windowed using a 850×3250 pixel section on CCD1. An exposure time of 100 s was used throughout the sequence, with a corresponding ∼19 s of readout time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">8784.5 and 8849.6 ˚ A Transit, 21 July 2010</head><p>Observations of the 2010 July 22 transit were tuned to the target wavelengths of 8784.5 and 8849.6 ˚ A, with the target 2.9 arc minutes from the optical centre. The observations were done by alternating between the two wavelengths in sets of two exposures at each wavelength. The conditions were clear and the observations took place during bright time in queue mode. The observations began at 00:26 UT and ended at 02:11 UT. The airmass ranged from 1.25 to 1.87. The actual seeing varied between 0.9 and 1.4 ′′ . A slight defocus was used in order to avoid saturation. Two reference stars were selected. The observations were windowed using a 849×3774 pixel section on CCD2. An exposure time of 120 s was used throughout the sequence, with a corresponding ∼22 s of readout time.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The OSIRIS CCD1 (red) and CCD2 (blue) 500kHz exposure curves showing the linearity of the detector. The measurements connected by a solid line were used to fit the estimated linearity of the detector. Images which had the brighter reference star at more than 45,000 ADUs were removed in order to ensure they used data sampled within the linear regime of the CCD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA REDUCTION</head><p>For all our data sets, we used standard IRAF 2 procedures for bias subtraction and flat-field correction. For the flatfield correction, we used dome flats that were taken after each observation and for each filter setting. For the observations done at the methane probing wavelengths 8770Å8770Å (two transits), 8784.5 ˚ A, 8835.0 ˚ A (two transits) and 8849.6 ˚ A were affected by the presence of sky lines. We therefore performed a sky subtraction of these images using the IRAF package TFred 3 .</p><p>Aperture photometry was done using the APPHOT package in IRAF. To obtain the best possible photometry, a large number of apertures and sky annuli were explored. The aperture and sky annulus combination which produced the least amount of scatter in the continuum (lowest χ 2 value by fitting a straight line to the continuum) was chosen. The number of reference stars varied depending on the size of the CCD readout window, the location of the sky lines as well as the observed scatter in the photometry of each reference star. To determine the optimal number of reference stars all stars above 15,000 ADU were initially chosen as potential reference stars. Each star which did not help reduce the overall scatter in the continuum, such as fainter stars affected by the sky emission rings (see §4.3) were removed.</p><p>The linearities of the CCD1 and CCD2 detectors were evaluated by measuring the average ADU counts of centrally windowed flat field images as a function of exposure time (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). Using the measured points known to be within the linear regime of the CCD (&lt; 25,000 ADU), a lin by non-linearity effects, the few images that contained a reference star with more than 45,000 ADUs were discarded, as counts above this level were shown to deviate from the linear extrapolation by more than 1 σ on CCD2. The resulting light curves are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> and 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Light curve fits</head><p>The transit light curves were fitted using the analytical transit equations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. The best fit light curve, together with the uncertainties associated with the fits, were determined by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC); see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gregory (2005)</ref> for the use of MCMC in uncertainty estimates, Collier <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cameron et al. (2007)</ref> for the application to transit fitting, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pont et al. (2009)</ref> for our specific implementation. This gave us a posterior probability distribution which we used to define the uncertainties (see §4.4 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). For a discussion on how the short baselines affect the radius ratio uncertainties, we refer the reader to Appendix A. Individual light curve fits were generated for each transit corresponding to different wavelengths. The initial starting parameters were from Bean et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2011)</ref>; see below. We used 5 chains each consisting of 500,000 steps, trimming away the first 50,000 points with a ∼25% of the proposed parameter steps being accepted. The free parameters in the fit were the radius ratio, Rp/Rs and the sky-ring positions outlined in §4.3 and summarised in <ref type="table">Table.</ref> 1. The fixed parameters were the period P = 1.58040481 days, mid-transit time T0 = 2454966.525123 BJDTDB (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for calculated ephemerides), impact parameter b = 0.27729 and the quadratic limb-darkening coefficients, u1 and u2, which varied depending on the wavelength of the observations. The stellar and orbital parameters were also kept fixed with Rs = 0.21 R ⊙ , the eccentricity e = 0 and the scaled semimajor axis a/Rs = 14.9749. We     <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. A quadratic limb darkening law of the following form was used</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(µ) I(1) = 1 − u1(1 − µ) − u2(1 − µ) 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is the intensity at the centre of the stellar disk, µ = cos(θ) is the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity while u1 and u2 are the limb darkening coefficients.   <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. These two images exemplify the drift in OH sky emission observed during an observing sequence. The image on the left was taken at the beginning of the sequence, whilst the image on the right was taken towards the end of the sequence during the 8770.0 ˚ A observations on the 10 th of June 2011. For some of the observations a linear correlation with sky line position was found and used to detrend the systematic effects it was causing in the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The effects of Earth's Atmosphere</head><p>In an attempt to assess the photometric variability caused by the Earth's atmosphere we studied the ratio of the reference star fluxes as a function of time and looked for correlations such as detector position, airmass, FWHM and the position of the OH emission sky lines present in the data (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). In order to determine which correlations were significant, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was computed and the model with the lowest BIC was accepted. The position of the OH sky emission rings, which were only visible in the images observed around the methane feature, were the dominant systematic effect occurring when a sky ring drifted across either the target or the reference stars. The sky-position was found to behave linearly throughout the observing sequence and was modelled by a linear fit to the position of the sky rings. For the data with no sky lines present, a slope term was used to correct for the slope of the out-of-transit flux. The effects of airmass and FWHM were present, but not strong enough to warrant any detrending. In the case of the slight FWHM trends, they seemed to mainly influence the data under variable seeing conditions. The light curves with their associated correlations were all fit simultaneously by performing a MCMC. A summary of the results can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The presence of sky lines</head><p>When using the tuneable filters on the OSIRIS instrument the observed wavelength decreases radially outward from the center of the tuneable filter due to a difference in the optical path length that the light has to travel. This effectively causes most of the stars in the field to be observed at slightly different wavelengths. The functional form of this radial wavelength dependance can be described using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">λ(r) = λ0 − 5.04 × r 2 + a(λ) × r 3<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the chromatic colour term is expressed as a(λ) = 6.1781 − 1.6024 × 10 −3 × λ + 1.0215 × 10 −7 × λ 2 , where λ0 ( ˚ A) is the central wavelength at which the tuneable filter is tuned, and r (arcmin) is the distance outward from this centre. The effects of the radial wavelength dependence is easily seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> where the prominent OH sky lines are visible. Ideally, each exposure is taken at the same wavelength throughout an observing sequence within a tolerance typically of 1-2 ˚ A, however, this is not the case for these observations. At the methane probing wavelengths 8770Å8770Å, 8784.5 ˚ A and 8835.0 ˚ A a clear drift in wavelength is observed (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>). This causes systematic effects in the observations when a significant portion of the sky-ring crosses either the target star or the reference stars. A linear combination of sky-ring position of the form A × sky + B was multiplied by the light curve fit, with sky being the sky ring position with A and B being parameters set to vary freely in order to detrend this systematic effect. For the observations at 8100Å8100Å, 8550Å8550Å and 8849.6 ˚ A there were no interfering sky lines present in the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Noise Estimate</head><p>The resulting light curves shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref> are affected by both white noise (noise uncorrelated with time, such as photon noise) as well as red noise (noise which correlates with time, such as airmass). In order to obtain realistic uncertainties the red noise must be taken into account, since only using Poisson noise can underestimate the uncertainties. We estimated the level of white noise (σw) and red noise (σr) using techniques described in Pont, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Zucker &amp; Queloz (2006)</ref>. The relationship between σw and σr is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ 2 1 = σ 2 w + σ 2 r (3)</formula><p>where σ1 is the standard deviation of the unbinned residuals, i.e., the difference between the individual normalised flux measurements and the best fit models of the transit light curves. In the absence of red noise the standard deviation in the binned residuals is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">σN = σ1 √ N M M − 1 (4)</formula><p>where M is the number of bins each containing N points. However, since σN is in most cases larger than the above calculated value (Eq. 4) due to the presence of red noise, the effects of red noise on the radius ratio had to be taken into account by using a re-weighting factor. The contribution by red noise was estimated by choosing N to be equal to the number of points in the transit, which varied in accordance with the cadence of the observations and can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σr = σ 2 N − σ 2 w N .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The red noise was then used to recompute the error bars, taking systematic noise into account by using a re-weighting factor, β, expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β = σr σw √ N .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The individual parameters used in the light curve fitting together with the estimated white and red noise are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Variability due to Stellar Activity</head><p>GJ 1214, an active M4.5 type star, has been shown to exhibit a ∼ 2% peak-to-peak stellar flux variability in the wavelength range 715-1000 nm and a long rotation period on the order of 53 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berta et al. 2011</ref>) based on three years of data from MEarth <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Nutzman &amp; Charbonneau 2008)</ref>. This is equivalent to a difference in radius ratio of ∆(Rp/Rs) ∼ 0.001 (using Eq. 7 from <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. 2011b</ref>).</p><p>Compared to the equilibrium cloud model atmosphere which includes methane, detailed in § 5.4, we would expect an increase in the radius ratio of the broad methane absorption band at 8800 -9000Å9000Å to be Rp/Rs ∼ 0.002 at the resolution of our measurements. As such it is necessary to consider the impact of stellar variability and star spots. The stellar activity can affect the transit depth by means of unocculted star spots, which increase the transit depth, or by the presence of occulted star spots, which lead to an underestimation of the transit depth. As the star spot coverage changes due to the evolution of the spots and stellar rotation, it is possible that small differences in the transit depths are measured at different epochs. To limit the effects of stellar activity it is essential that the different wavelength observations are done at, or close to, the same time. In this study, the light curves that probed the methane feature were acquired over three transits by alternating the tuneable filters between two wavelengths. This gave a to- tal of 6 individual transits around the methane feature (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref>), two at 8770Å8770Å and one at 8784.5 ˚ A (off-methane) and two at 8835Å8835Å and 8849.6 ˚ A (on-methane). The transit light curve at 8550Å8550Å taken on the 2 nd of June 2010 shows a considerably shallower transit depth inconsistent at the ∼3 σ significance level with previously measured radius ratios by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bean et al. 2011</ref>) . Although the cause of this is unknown, it is possible the shallower light curve is partly the result of a below average number of star spots on the surface of GJ 1214, causing a shallower transit depth to be observed. No evidence for the presence of an occulted star spot is present in the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter et al. (2011)</ref> also observed a shallower transit of GJ 1214b 3 nights later, during the morning of the 6 th of June 2010 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref> near BJD-2455260 + 90). Considering that the estimated rotation speed of GJ 1214b is of the order of 53 days, it is likely that both observations were affected by a lower number of star spots than usual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">The impact of the observed wavelength drifts</head><p>The change in sky line position during the course of the observations is indicative of a change in wavelength. By measuring the position of the sky lines in the images the corresponding drift in wavelength was estimated following Eq. 2 with the drifts shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>. The most significant wavelength drift is seen in the 10 th of June 2011 observations where a wavelength change of ∼ 13Å13Å was observed. No detectable sky lines were observed during the 17 th of August 2010 and 2 nd of June 2010 observations. Although every attempt was made to tune the filter to a wavelength absent of strong sky lines it is likely that the sky lines still affect the data despite the sky background having been subtracted. In particular the OH-emission line doublet at 8829.514Å514Å and 8829.525Å525Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Rousselot et al. 2000</ref>) has likely interacted with the 8835Å8835Å observations conducted on the 10 th of June 2011. The 8770Å8770Å observations, done the same night are not affected by a similar shift in wavelength which suggests the OH-emission line is likely causing the systematic relative flux variations seen in the 8835Å8835Å observations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> (fifth panel from the top) the observed wavelength drifted towards shorter wavelengths during the night, with the OH line (red line) causing an increase in the relative flux. This is clearly seen in the raw transit light curve shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> (middle green light curve on the right).</p><p>With the sky-rings subtracted before performing aperture photometry only very small sky-ring residuals are left in the images.  spectroscopic observations of GJ 1214 with the GTC telescope using the R500R grism and a 10 ′′ slit on the 25 th of July 2012, we compared the wavelength drifts with the spectra of GJ1214 and one of the reference stars used. The two spectra which have a resolution of about R ∼ 250 are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> with a rescaled view of the methane-probing region shown in the sub-window located towards the upper right of the plot. Due to the nature of the long slit, only one other reference star could be fit on the slit. Since no major absorption lines were crossed it is unlikely that the systematic wavelength trends are caused by different parts of the spectrum of GJ 1214 or the reference star being sampled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Probing the methane feature</head><p>Here we compare our five observed transits of GJ 1214b with theoretical models presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Morley et al. (2013)</ref> to investigate the nature of GJ 1214b's atmosphere, in particular, to look for extra absorption due to methane (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>  and 13). Using tuneable narrowband filters, we are able to probe the planets atmosphere at a higher spectral resolution (R 600-750) than would otherwise be possible using standard photometric filters. The possibility of a methane feature is explored by comparing the difference in radius ratios between the onmethane, off-methane observations each done on the same night. For the observations done on the 21 st of July 2010, the difference in radius ratios were found to be ∆R = −0.0013± 0.0031, for the 28 th of August 2010, ∆R = −0.0029±0.0041, and for the 10 th of June 2011, ∆R = 0.0004 ± 0.0023. The weighted average of the difference in radii from all three nights are calculated to be ∆R = −0.0007 ± 0.0017 which in terms of scale heights (H) is expressed as ∆R ≃ −0.5 ± 1.2 H, using H/Rs = 0.0014 and assuming a hydrogen dominated atmosphere. We therefore detect no increase across a possible methane feature.

For a cloudy H-rich model to obscure the transmission spectrum, the clouds have to be optically thick high in the atmosphere where transmission spectroscopy probes (∼10 −3 bar). An inefficient heat redistribution would causes the P-T profile to be warmer, which would cause the profile to cross the condensation curve higher in the atmosphere. In addition, a low sedimentation efficiency would create a more vertically extended cloud. We note that photochemical models which include the formation of naturally forming photochemical hazes high in the atmosphere can also mute the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b.</p><p>Croll et al. (2011) noted that the increased transit depth measured in the Ks-band could be due to an opacity source such as methane or water, requiring hazes in the atmosphere. These measurements could also be explained by the observed spectral features being more complicated than current models predict. With a detection sensitivity on the order of a scale height at high spectral resolution, we are capable of excluding the presence of a methane absorption band spanning multiple scale heights, which higher resolution models might reveal in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We present GTC OSIRIS narrowband observations of five transits of GJ 1214b, three of which probe the presence of methane at two near simultaneously obtained wavelengths. We do not find no increase in radius ratios across the possible methane feature with a planet-to-star radius ratio, ∆R = −0.0007±0.0017, across the feature. This corresponds to an increase in scale height of −0.5 ± 1.2 H assuming a hydrogen dominated atmosphere. We are therefore not able to rule out any of our water and cloud based models. Cloudfree models generally provide poor fits to the data. Even the best fitting cloud free model assuming a 50× solar composition atmosphere with an efficient heat distribution can be rejected at the 2.7σ confidence level form our data alone. The results, which are compatible with previous results of a largely flat transmission spectrum, do not rule out the possibility of a high altitude haze or a water dominated atmosphere in the atmosphere of GJ 1214b, but do rule out methane features spanning multiple scale heights. Observations around the methane absorption band are predominantly limited by low cadence observations and sky emission lines in Earth's atmosphere affecting the photometric quality, making the determination of the systematic noise challenging. With tuneable filters capable of high resolution measurements (R ≈ 600-750) there is currently a need for high resolution methane models below 1 µm. calculated using the MCMC method. To asses the relationship, we generated five light curves each consisting of the the 2010 August 28 8770 transit data with additional synthetic data points added to the right hand continuum. For each of the five light curves, a series of MCMC chains, each consisting of 500,000 steps (trimming away the first 50,000 points), were calculated iteratively removing one point from the right hand continuum before calculating a new chain. This process was repeated for the five light curves with the resulting radius ratio uncertainties subsequently median combined. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. A1</ref>, as points are removed from the continuum the radius ratio uncertainties as given by the MCMC method increase following a power law. The relationship is further verified by our observations when comparing the derived uncertainties on the radius ratio between the 2010-08-28 and the 2011-06-10 transits, which were done at the same wavelengths and show a consistent decrease in uncertainties with the addition of more points in the post-egress continuum.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
