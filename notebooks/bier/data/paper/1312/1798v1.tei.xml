			<abstract>
				<p>As small solid grains grow into larger ones in protoplanetary nebulae, or in the cloudy atmospheres of exoplanets, they generally form porous aggregates rather than solid spheres. A number of previous studies have used highly sophisticated schemes to calculate opacity models for irregular, porous particles with size much smaller than a wavelength. However, mere growth itself can affect the opacity of the medium in far more significant ways than the detailed compositional and/or structural differences between grain constituents once aggregate particle sizes exceed the relevant wavelengths. This physics is not new; our goal here is to provide a model that provides physical insight and is simple to use in the increasing number of protoplanetary nebula evolution, and exoplanet atmosphere, models appearing in recent years, yet quantitatively captures the main radiative properties of mixtures of particles of arbitrary size, porosity, and composition. The model is a simple combination of effective medium theory with small-particle closed-form expressions, combined with suitably chosen transitions to geometric optics behavior. Calculations of wavelength-dependent emission and Rosseland mean opacity are shown and compared with Mie theory. The model&apos;s fidelity is very good in all comparisons we have made, except in cases involving pure metal particles or monochromatic opacities for solid particles with size comparable to the wavelength.</p>

We show how porosity trades off with size in determining emergent Spectral Energy Distributions and determining Rosseland mean opacities. We use accurate material properties for a realistic, temperature-dependent, compositional suite, and simplified but realistic scattering and absorption efficiencies which avoid the need for numerical Mie calculations. In this sense the approach is similar in spirit to some previous studies, but emphasizes a utilitarian approach and ease of general applicability. The physics and simplifications are described in section 3 below; in section 4 we show some validation tests of the model, and in section 5 we describe the behavior of porous aggregates.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Opacity model</head><p>In this section we describe the theoretical basis for our calculations of particulate opacity. Our goal is to capture all of the significant physics in the simplest fashion possible, so the model can be incorporated into evolutionary models at little computational cost. Realistic material refractive indices are included for a cosmic abundance suite of likely nebula solids: water ice, silicates, refractory organics, iron sulfide, and metallic iron. These refractive indices, and relative abundances as a function of temperature are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see <ref type="table">Table)</ref>. We chose these specific values to allow better validation and comparison with previous work, but they are widely used; alternate tabulations are easily incorporated, such as found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Draine and Lee (1984)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Henning et al (1999)</ref>. Our emphasis is on how size and porosity effects can be dealt with simply and seamlessly as grains aggregate and grow into a size regime where details of composition and refractive indices are perhaps secondary. Our basic approach will be to separate particles having an arbitrary size distribution into two regimes which both have closed-form solutions in practical cases. We use the fact that particle interactions with radiation of any wavelength λ can be systematically addressed in terms of the optical size of the particle x = 2πr/λ, where r is the particle radius. The model presented here treats "small" particles (x 1) as volume absorbers/scatterers and "large" particles (x 1) as geometrical optics absorbers/scatterers. We will occasionally refer to Van de Hulst (1957; henceforth VDH), <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hansen and Travis (1974;</ref><ref type="bibr">henceforth HT)</ref>, and Bohren and Huffman (1983).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Extinction, absorption, and scattering efficiencies</head><p>Radiation is removed from any beam at a rate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I = I 0 e −κeρl (1)</formula><p>where ρ is the volume mass density of the gas and dust mixture, κ e (cm 2 g −1 ) is the total opacity, and l is the path length. The monochromatic opacity, for a gas-particle mixture containing particles of radius r with number density n(r), is formally defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">κ e,λ = 1 ρ g πr 2 n(r)Q e (r, λ)dr,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Q e is the extinction efficiency for a particle of radius r, at wavelength λ. The Rosseland mean opacity, which controls the flow of energy through an optically thick medium, is derived by an appropriate weighting of κ e,λ over wavelength (see Appendix A). Extinction is due to a combination of pure absorption (reradiated as heat) and scattering (redirection of the incident beam). Rigorously, these components are additive; that is Q e = Q a + Q s , where Q a is the absorption efficiency and Q s the scattering efficiency. The single-scattering albedo of the particle is = Q s /Q e . To the extent that the particles do scatter radiation without absorbing it (Q s = 0), the angular distribution of the scattered component (the phase function P (Θ)) is relevant. The first moment of the phase function g describes the degree of forward scattering:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">g = cosΘ = P (Θ)cosΘsinΘdΘ P (Θ)sinΘdΘ<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Isotropic scattering results in g = 0; very small particles (Rayleigh scatterers) have a phase function proportional to cos 2 Θ, which also leads to g = 0. This is why scattering by tiny particles is often approximated as isotropic. Large particles have a strong forward scattering lobe due to diffraction; for such particles g may approach unity (cf. HT) and can even be approximated as unscattered <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Irvine 1975</ref>). In may cases of thermal emission when r λ (section 5.3), only the absorption/emission component is important:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">κ a,λ = 1 ρ g πr 2 n(r)Q a (r, λ)dr,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Analytical expressions for Q a and Q s have been known for over a century in certain asymptotic regimes; the well-known Rayleigh scattering regime for particles much smaller than the wavelength is one example. Similarly, scattering properties of very large objects have long been well understood in terms of Lambertian and related scattering laws. Considerable amounts of computation have been devoted in recent years to determination of efficiencies and phase functions in the intermediate Mie scattering regime, where particle size is comparable to the wavelength.</p><p>One important point for our purposes, that is demonstrated by HT, is that many of the exotic fluctuations in scattering and absorption properties which characterize the Mie regime vanish if one averages over a broad distribution of particle sizes. Further smoothing occurs given a combination of realistic particle nonsphericity and random particle orientations. Furthermore, a large number of experimental studies (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bohren and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Huffman 1983 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Cuzzi 1980</ref> for references) have shown that integrated parameters such as Q and g are much less affected by shape effects than, for example, the phase function itself, and the parameters of interest for thermal emission and absorption (Q a , Q s , and g) vary smoothly between the "Rayleigh" and "geometric optics" regimes. This observed behavior provides a certain comfort level for the simple assumptions we make here. Our model does not treat P (Θ) at all, but constrains g directly based on a fairly well-behaved dependence on the size and composition of the scatterer (section 3.2). We use g to correct Q a and Q s for energy which is primarily scattered forward, and thus does not participate significantly in directional redistribution of energy. Thus, our model would not be appropriate for applications where scattering dominates absorption and the directional distribution of scattered energy is of primary interest. Fortunately, primitive aggregate particles made of ice, silicates, carbonrich organics and tiny metal grains are good absorbers and poor scatterers across most size ranges, but Q s does contribute to κ λ in some regimes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The model: Calculation of efficiencies</head><p>A good exposition of the form of the particle absorption and scattering coefficients is presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Draine and Lee (1984;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> henceforth DL); our expressions may be derived directly from those published by DL, and we will not repeat much of their presentation. DL describe the radiative properties in terms of absorption and scattering cross sections C a,s = Q a,s πr 2 , which are directly related to particle volume in the limit r λ. The efficiencies may then be expressed in terms of the electric polarizability (VDH p. 73), which is a function of the (complex) particle dielectric constant = 1 + ii 2 (DL eqn 3.11). The particle refractive index m = n r + in i is the square root of the dielectric constant.

For the case at hand, however, once any significant amount of particle accumulation occurs, aggregates are likely to be roughly equidimensional and, especially if the particles are porous, the average refractive indices are not large (see below), so we will treat Q a and Q s as independent of particle orientation and, setting L k = 1/3, obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Q a = 12 2πr λ 2 ( 1 + 2) 2 + 2 2 (8) and Q s = 8 3 2πr λ 4 ( 1 − 1) 2 + 2 2 ( 1 + 2) 2 + 2 2 ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>(VDH pp. 71, DL84; see also equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(14)</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miyake and Nakagawa 1993)</ref>. Neither Miyake and Nakagawa (1993) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref> discuss Q s , but it becomes important for porous, weakly absorbing particles in the transition regimes we wish to bridge with our model, where wavelength and particle size are not extremely different. In the geometrical optics regime, nonspherical shapes can increase the surface area per unit mass, and thus the extinction efficiency, but for moderate nonsphericity the effect is only some tens of percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pollack and Cuzzi 1980)</ref>. This effect is also neglected for the present. For plausible aggregates, magnetic effects are not important (see however Appendix B). In the limit where n i n r − 1, which is reasonable for ices, silicates, organics, and their ensemble aggregates, equations 8 and 9 reduce to the simpler and more familiar forms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Q a = 24xn r n i (n 2 r + 2) 2<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q s = 8x 4 3 (n 2 r − 1) 2 (n 2 r + 2) 2 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where x = 2πr/λ. These are essentially the classical expressions given by VDH (p. 70).</p><p>In our code we actually use the full equations 8 and 9 above for Q a and Q s for the radiative behavior of particles much smaller than the geometric optics regime; these equations are valid for arbitrary m (DL). Equation 8 for Q a (linear in particle radius) is used for all sizes. However, in the Mie transition region (in which the particle size is comparable to a wavelength) we modeled Q s using a function valid for n r of order unity (the Rayleigh-Gans regime; VDH p132-133, p.182). That is, at a transition value x 0 we change from the DL expression (equation 9) to the Rayleigh-Gans regime expression (VDH p. 182 and final equation of section 11.23):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Q s = 1 2 (2x) 2 (n r − 1) 2 1 + n i n r − 1 2 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>The transition value x 0 = 1.3 comes from setting the two expressions equal to each other. This transition from x 4 to x 2 dependence bridges the region between the Rayleigh and geometric optics regimes. It is shown in VDH (p 177) that a coupled dependence on the so-called "phase shift" 2x(n r − 1) (for n i &lt;&lt; n r − 1), which includes both n and r, captures the peak and shape of Q s . These expressions are valid as long as n r − 1 is not much larger than 1/x (Bohren and Huffman 1983, p.140); this is the expected regime for aggregates and mixtures of plausible materials. Our expressions do not capture the Fresnel-like oscillatory behavior of Q shown by the the more complete series expansions in VDH and the full Mie theory, but do capture the correct small-and large-x behavior, and the proper transition size/wavelength. This is an increasingly good approach as the particle size distribution gets broader and the particles become more absorbing (HT), in which case the resonance behavior near 2x(n r − 1) ∼ several diminishes and indeed vanishes (see, eg., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cuzzi and Pollack 1978)</ref>. Aggregate particles considered here are very good absorbers in general, having very broad <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Left: Scattering efficiency Q s of a particle with refractive indices n r = 1.33, n i = 0 as a function of its optical size x = 2πa/λ using Mie Theory (figure reproduced directly from Hansen and Travis 1974, by permission, where particle radius = a). The parameter b varies the width of the size distribution; as the size distribution gets broad, exotic ripples dues to interference average out and vanish. Right: dependence on the optical size and material properties of the scattering asymmetry parameter g = cosΘ, for narrow size distributions of different optical size.

See for instance figure 1 left, where in the geometric optics limit 2πr/λ → ∞, Q e = Q s → 2. The figure represents lossless particles; if absorption is present, Q s (which includes diffraction) trends downwards and asymptotes to a value closer to unity (HT <ref type="figure">figure 9</ref>). Note that the exotic ripples are primarily seen for monodispersions and narrow size distributions, and vanish as broader size distributions are used.</p><p>Although the full radiative transfer problem must be solved when the angular variation of the intensity is of primary concern, so that the phase function P (Θ) is important, certain valuable simplifications are common when only angle-integrated quantities such as energy or flux are of concern. In such cases, one often merely corrects the extinction efficiency for the overall degree of forward-or back-scattering. We will adopt a common scaling (e.g., Van de Hulst 1980) sometimes referred to as the radiation pressure scaling, and adjust our efficiencies to take account of nonisotropic scattering as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Q e = Q e − gQ s = Q e (1 − 0 g) = Q a + Q s (1 − g).<label>(13)</label></formula><p>That is, to the degree that scattered radiation is concentrated into the forward direction, it may be regarded as unremoved from the beam. For instance, even a large scattering efficiency contributes nothing to the extinction if the scattering is purely forward directed (g = 1). Negative values of g (preferential backscattering) increase the extinction efficiency; in this case, it is even harder for radiation to escape than for thermalized or isotropically scattered radiation. This same correction is applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pollack et al (1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al ( , 1994</ref>; see section 5.4 for more discussion. Modeling efforts relying to any degree on the Eddington approximation, in which scattered radiation is nearly isotropic, are perhaps better conducted using extinction efficiencies that are scaled in the way shown above, instead of using the formal Mie calculations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Irvine 1975)</ref>. For instance, de Kok et al <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2011)</ref> show how forward scattering by plausible exoplanet cloud particles can influence emergent near infrared fluxes; the above treatment of forward scattering partially accounts for this behavior by truncating away strong forward scattering and allowing the non-truncated scattered component to be treated as isotropic. In the approach presented here, the normal optical depth is defined using a value of κ λ that has been adjusted for forward scattering effects following equations 2 and 13 (and 17 if appropriate):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">τ λ (z) = ∞ z κ λ (z)ρ g (z)dz.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Instead of performing full Mie calculations to obtain the scattering asymmetry parameter g = cosΘ, we make use of the crudely partitioned behavior illustrated by HT (reproduced in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref> (right)). We have explored several simple ways of doing this, and have chosen the following determination of g, consistent with figures 1 and 2 ( notice that figure 1(right) is for a fairly low n r = 1.33): for n i &lt; 1 : g = 0.7(x/3) 2 if x &lt; 3, and g ≈ 0.7 if x &gt; 3,</p><p>for n i &gt; 1 : g ≈ −0.2 if x &lt; 3, and g ≈ 0.5 if x &gt; 3.</p><p>The value of the g-asymptote at large x, and the transition value of x, vary slightly with n r ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 2)</ref>; the values we selected apply to the EMT values of n r ∼ 1.7 − 2.1 and n i n r , most relevant to our mixed-aggregate applications. We have not attempted to fine-tune either the asymptote or the transition value, and leave the large-n i definition of g in its crude bimodal form (the large-n i recipe has almost no effect on the results). Further finetuning is somewhat beyond what we expect of a simple utilitarian model, but could be done easily.</p><p>The final piece of the model involves matching the growing values of Q s and Q a in the Rayleigh and/or Rayleigh-Gans regime to constant values in the geometric optics regime, simply by limiting their magnitudes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Q a &lt; 1 and Q s (1 − g) &lt; 1.<label>(17)</label></formula><p>This can be thought of as limiting the absorption cross section, and the diffraction-corrected scattering cross section, to the physical cross section.

A detailed discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper. One final detail must be mentioned, relevant for applications where particles of pure metal are important. Equations (8) and (9 or 12) include only the electric dipole interaction terms that are appropriate for everything but metals, and thus for all of our aggregate particle models where refractive indices are not extremely large. However, when we compare our model with the heterogeneous-composition grain mixture of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref>, in which pure iron metal grains play a role, we have used a crude correction to Q a for magnetic dipole terms as well, following DL84, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref>, and others (see Appendix B); these calculations are all compared with the full Mie theory below.  <ref type="bibr">(1994)</ref>.

This term is only the leading term in an expansion, here used outside its formal realm of validity (see Appendix B).

Even mm-size chondrules are each a mixture of 1-10µm size mineral grains of silicate, iron, and iron sulfide, and the ubiquitous meteorite matrix is a mix of smaller grains of all these materials, perhaps originally aggregates. So, for our aggregates, we assume only one (mixed) grain composition; the assumption may be shaky at the very smallest sizes which may be mono-mineralic, but coagulation models show that the tiniest particles are quickly consumed by growing aggregates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ormel and Okuzumi 2013)</ref>.

Consider the fact that for tiny particles with r λ, as described in section 3.2, Q e becomes proportional to the total volume or mass of material, regardless of the specific grain size distribution. This suggests that Q e also becomes independent of the configuration of the grains; they can be dispersed or combined into clumps, as long as the <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>: Monochromatic opacity in pure absorption (eg. using only Q a ), such as would be relevant to interpreting mm-cm wavelength observations of disk fluxes. Two powerlaw distributions are shown, all of the form n(r) = n o r −s , where n(r) is a particle number density per unit particle radius, with three different values of r max . The particles are aggregates of mixed cosmic composition at 100K. Left: solid particles (porosity =0); right: porous particles (porosity =0.9). clumps themselves remain much smaller than the wavelength, without affecting the result. Indeed this is the configuration implicit in the Garnett-averaged results for the Pollack size distribution; tiny particles are rearranged into aggregates of still-tiny particles. The good agreement testifies to the validity of the Garnett EMT in calculating a single set of effective refractive indices (at each wavelength) from which to calculate Q e . That this is not trivial is demonstrated by the poor agreement obtained from the intuitively simpler linear volume mixing approximation to the mean refractive index (Appendix C; blue curve in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> in Appendix C shows in another way how badly volume mixing performs when even small amounts of high-refractive-index material are involved, as they are here. Of course, as particles grow larger, this equivalence will fail (a hint of divergence is seen at short wavelength in <ref type="figure">figure 7</ref>). In this regime we will continue to rely on the Garnett EMT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Monochromatic opacities and disk masses</head><p>Perhaps the hardest challenge for our model is calculating monochromatic opacities for particle size distributions dominated by sizes comparable to the wavelength. Applications to wavelengths which are either much longer than the particle sizes in question (eg. most of figures 4 or 7), or much shorter (geometrical optics), are very reliable and straightforward. To better determine the limitations of our model, we explore monochromatic opacity for broad size distributions where many of the particles are comparable to the wavelengths of greatest interest to mm-cm observations of disks. The results (figure 8) are comparable to those shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miyake and Nakagawa (1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">MN93)</ref> and D' <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Alessio et al (2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">D01)</ref>. Because MN93 and D01 each adopt somewhat different choices for refractive indices and compositional regimes, we do not compare our results directly to theirs, but instead conduct our own Mie calculations using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref> refractive indices. D01 assumed a heterogeneous particle distribution (for instance, particles of pure ice, pure silicate, or pure troilite occur up to the mm-cm maximum sizes), whereas MN93 more typically assumed heterogeneous mixtures of aggregate particles with variable porosity, which we feel is more plausible under realistic conditions and also assume below.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref> we compare monochromatic profiles of the true absorption opacity κ a,λ from our model (equation 4) with full Mie calculations. MN93 have argued that scattering (which is important for extinction and thermal equilibrium modeling) is negligible in observations of this type and that pure absorption dominates thermal emission, and D01 agree.</p><p>Results are shown for differential size distributions n(r) = n o r −s , with s=2.0 and 3.1, with smallest radius of 1µm and largest radius r max . The value s = 2 (heavy curves) allows the larger particles to dominate the area and mass, while s = 3.1 (light curves) gives a more equitable distribution of area across the range of sizes. For each powerlaw slope, r max is varied from 10µm to 1cm (the Mie calculations bog down for larger sizes). In the left panel, we show results for solid particles (internal density = 1.38 g/cm 3 ). In the right panel, we show particles with 90% porosity. The solid curves are from our model and the dashed curves are full Mie calculations.</p><p>The agreement for porous particles is extremely good for the full range of sizes and size distributions. For solid particles ( <ref type="figure">figure 8 left)</ref>, the Mie calculations exhibit an enhanced Q a in the resonance region, covering perhaps a decade of wavelength around 2πr/λ ∼ 1 (see eg HT). This effect is difficult for a model lacking complete physical optics to reproduce. Such "bumps" in κ are visible in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref> of MN93, for the solid particle case, but lacking in their figure 8 (for 90% porous particles), in good agreement with our results where all combinations of r max and powerlaw slope reach the same long-wavelength asymptote rather quickly. The same "bump" is seen, for instance, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ricci et al (2010)</ref>, where the particles are actually not very porous (∼ 40%?). It is this contribution which carries through at shorter wavelengths, leaving our opacities 20% low or so relative to Mie values; this small difference, in a wavelength-independent regime, is probably insignificant for most purposes when the maximum particle size is probably close to the specific observing wavelength and the porosity is not large, as discussed more below.</p><p>The more shallow 2.0 powerlaw, dominated in area and mass by particles at or near the upper size cutoff, abruptly transitions to wavelength-independent opacity at the wavelength where, roughly, Q a (r max , λ) = 1. At longer wavelengths, a universal curve is followed, characterized by the total mass in the system. Notice that, for the 2.0 powerlaws, the inflection point moves to shorter wavelengths and the short-wavelength opacity increases as the upper radius cutoff decreases or as the porosity increases. This is a direct implication of equations 8 and 7, which together imply that Q a ∝ rn i , and in most cases, in spite of the imperfection of the linear volume mixing model, n i is roughly proportional to (1 − φ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure  12)</ref>. Meanwhile, for wavelengths shorter than the Q a (r max , λ) = 1 turnover, each particle or radius r is less massive than a solid particle by the factor (1 − φ), so the number of particles is larger (for a given total mass) by a factor 1/(1 − φ) (see also section 5.4 below). That is, fluffy cm-size particles have ten times the opacity of solid particles of the same radius (in the short-wavelength limit) because their 10 times lower mass per particle allows there to be ten times as many of them than the solid particles of the same size. Their mass per particle is still 100 times larger than that of a mm-size solid particle, but their cross-sectional area per particle is 100 times larger, so the curve for porous, cm-radius particles lies on top of the curve for solid, mm-radius particles even at short wavelengths. This behavior can be seen tracing the differences between the heavy red and black curves, through solid, dashed, and dotted manifestations.</p><p>The lightweight curves, for the steeper 3.1 powerlaw size distribution having the same radius limits, contain more small particles and thus show more spectral signatures at midinfrared wavelengths. They also show broader slope transitions in κ a λ around Q a (r max , λ) = 1. Note the envelope of slope for all combinations of powerlaw, upper size limit, and porosity, for which Q a (r max , λ) = 1 has not been reached. Opacities (fluxes) at these wavelengths are independent of particle size, and thus capture all the mass even if particles have grown to cm size. Different powerlaw slopes or other details of the size distributions could lead to slightly different functional forms in the transition region, and can thus be constrained by high-quality observations. These comparisons of our model monochromatic opacities with full Mie theory provide further support for the Rosseland mean opacities which are based on them, certainly for porous particles, and illustrate the extent of the limitations for solid particles. In applications such as mm-cm monochromatic SED slope analysis, with the goal of determining largest particle sizes, full Mie theory should be used, and are not burdensome here because the wavelengths of interest are not much smaller than the particle sizes of interest.</p><p>These scalings with size and porosity are further illustrated in <ref type="figure">figure 9</ref>, comparing our runs for porous particles, which agree well with Mie calculations but are easier to extend to large sizes, with actual Mie calculations for solid particles. In <ref type="figure">figure 9</ref> we show a widely used opacity rule (Beckwith et al 1990, Williams and Cieza 2011): κ ν = 0.1(ν/10 12 Hz) β , with β=1. Note that the canonical Beckwith et al (1990) opacity could be fit by a suite of porous particles extending to 100 cm radius, especially with a slope of 3.1 (or perhaps slightly steeper). As noted by previous authors, cm-size solid particles also provide a fairly good match to the slope. All models that match the slope have opacity quantitatively smaller than the canonical B90 opacity, however, by a factor of at least several (also found by Birnstiel et al 2010) possibly suggesting larger inferred disk masses.</p><p>In outer disks where gas densities are very low, particles of even mm size and low-tomoderate porosity are dynamic radial migrators under the influence of gas drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Takeuchi and Lin 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Brauer et al 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Hughes and Armitage 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Birnstiel et al 2010</ref> and observations apparently show radial segregation of gas and particles in more than one outer disk (Andrews et al 2012, <ref type="bibr">Pérez et al 2012)</ref>. Moreover, such particles also couple to the large, high-velocity eddies and would be expected to have fairly high collision velocities. In this regime, large particles, even with 90% porosity, would collide at significant velocities, inconsistent with retaining their postulated high porosities. This is because the aerodynamic coupling of a particle to turbulence is determined by the product of its radius and density (see, eg, Völk et al l980, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cuzzi and Hogan 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Dominik et al 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Ormel and Cuzzi 2007</ref>. Thus it seems more plausible that the particles matching the B90 opacity in shape (or something like it) are indeed moderately compact, cm-radius, objects, and not meter-size, <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: Monochromatic opacity, comparing Mie calculations for solid particles (dashed lines) with our model for porous particles (solid lines). Two powerlaw distributions are shown: s=2.0 (heavy lines) and s=3.1 (light lines), and the upper size is varied from 1mm to 100cm (the 10 and 100cm size results are not shown for the Mie case because the mmwavelength slopes would be too flat and the calculations are onerous). The widely used opacity law of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beckwith et al (1990)</ref> is the dashed line labeled B90.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Rosseland mean opacity: effects of size and porosity</head><p>In this section we continue to assume well-mixed aggregates of material in each particle and extend our calculations of Rosseland mean opacities to particles with a wider range of size and porosity. First we show how growth affects the Rosseland mean opacities introduced in section 3.1 and the Appendix. Clearly, for particle size much larger than the wavelength, the opacity varies as the ratio of cross section to mass, or as 1/r (see Appendix of Pollack et al 1994 for a longer exposition). As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pollack et al (1985)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miyake and Nakagawa (1993)</ref>, growth from microns to centimeters implies a decrease in κ R by four orders of magnitude, dwarfing any uncertainties regarding the actual composition of the particles and rendering the small differences seen in figures 4 -7 somewhat moot. We illustrate the <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>: Rosseland mean opacities for various particle sizes and porosities, all calculated using our approach. Green: heterogeneous ISM distribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref>; black curves: solid aggregate particles of no porosity with the same mass; solid: 10 µm radius monodispersion; Dashed: 100 µm radius monodispersion; dotted: 1000 µm radius monodispersion (multiplied by 10). Also shown are red: 100 µm radius monodispersion with the same mass but porosity of 70%; blue: 100 µm radius monodispersion with the same mass but porosity of 90% (discussed in section 5.2). effect using figures 10 and 11. The size distributions in <ref type="figure">figure 10</ref> are monodispersions, which we have cautioned about previously, but in these calculations the large range of wavelengths over which efficiencies are integrated mimics the effects of a broad size distribution.</p><p>Particle growth from the ISM distribution of Pollack et al (containing many submicron grains which are effective at blocking shortwave radiation characteristic of the higher temperatures shown), rapidly decreases the Rosseland opacity, even when growth is only to radius of 10µm (solid black curve). The decrease continues as particles grow to 100µm (dashed black) and 1mm (dotted black, multiplied by 10) radii. The opacity curves for the larger particles have a characteristic stepped appearance, with the steps representing changes in solid mass fraction at different evaporation temperatures. The opacity is nearly constant within a step, because particles much larger than a wavelength are in the constant-Q e regime independent of wavelength. Comparing the black dashed and dotted curves, where the dotted curve is 10 times the value of κ R for 1 mm radius particles, shows that the 1/r scaling is nearly exact for these sizes. The scaling is only slightly less easily explained between the 10µ m and 100µm radius solid particles. At the lower temperatures (longer wavelengths) the 10µm particles have not yet reached the geometrical optics limit, which occurs roughly for temperatures higher than 300K where the blackbody peak wavelength is around 10µm. Thus, the scaling between these two sizes is less than a factor of ten by an amount that depends on temperature (wavelength). <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> also shows the expected effects of porosity (section 5.3); the red and green curves, for 100µm radius monodispersions of particles having porosities of 70% and 90% respectively, show good agreement with the expected scaling by 1/ <ref type="figure">(1−φ)</ref>; that is, to conserve mass if the particle density decreases to (1 − φ)ρ, we must increase their number density by a factor of 1/(1 − φ). In this regime where the particles are already much larger than the most heavily weighted wavelengths in question (except at the far left of the plot), the Q e per particle does not change, so the net opacity of the ensemble increases by a factor of 1/(1 − φ). So, the particle growth and porosity effects are robust, easily explained using simple physical arguments, and captured by the model.</p><p>The Rosseland mean opacities for several wide powerlaw size distributions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 11</ref>. The behavior is similar overall to behavior seen previously and explained above. These powerlaws have a smallest particle radius (1 µm) which is slightly larger than the typical size on the Pollack et al size distribution, so κ R is somewhat larger at low temperatures (long effective wavelengths) but slightly lower and flatter at high temperature (short effective wavelengths). Powerlaws extending to larger size reduce the overall opacity at higher temperature, at least, by tying up more mass in larger particles. Porosity increases the overall opacity everywhere for the powerlaws extending to the larger sizes, because the dominant wavelengths involved are generally tens of microns or less. However, some wrinkles in the details, and differences between figures 10 and 11, arise from the scattering terms due to Q s (1 − g) in κ R , which become important for particles with low n i when the particle size and wavelength are comparable.</p><p>It is these drastic decreases in opacity with grain growth (Movshovitz and Podolak 2008) that led <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Movshovitz et al (2010)</ref> to conclude that gas giant formation could have happened much earlier than previous estimates which had already assumed an arbitrary 50x cut in opacity relative to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref> baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hubickyj et al 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Lissauer et al 2009</ref>. The reason is that growth in the most important part of the radiative zone proceeds to cm-size, implying opacities even 10x smaller there than the smallest (for solid mm-size particles) shown in figures 10 and 11. If the particles are porous, their opacity could be increased, however, as shown in those figures. This would seem to be an example of how the destiny of the great can be determined by the behavior of the small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>We outline a very simple, closed-form radiative transfer model which incorporates and connects well-understood asymptotic behavior for particles smaller than and larger than the wavelength. The approach is simple enough to provide good physical insight and to include in evolutionary models requiring radiative transfer. The model is easily adapted to arbitrary combinations of particle size, composition, and porosity across the range of plausible protoplanetary nebula and exoplanet cloud particle properties (excepting highly elongated particles), and yields values of Rosseland mean opacity which are in good agreement with more sophisticated but more time consuming Mie or DDA calculations. Planck opacities are even simpler to calculate (they are straight Blackbody-weighted means over wavelength). We illustrate the significant roles of particle growth and porosity in determining opacity. The model is not recommended even for Rosseland opacities in cases where ensembles of large, pure metal particles are expected. The method even gives very good approximations to monochromatic opacities unless the particles are solid and the specific wavelength of interest is comparable to the dominant particle size, where the model is unable to track "resonance" behavior of the absorption efficiency. Thus for detailed spectral index analysis Green: heterogeneous ISM distribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref>; black curves: solid aggregate particles of no porosity with the same mass and powerlaw size distributions of differential slope 3.1; solid: 1-10 µm radius; Dashed: 1-100 µm radius; dotted: 1µm -1mm radius; dot-dash: 1µm -1cm radius (shown are red: 1µm -1cm radius with porosity of 90%.</p><p>of mm-cm wavelength protoplanetary nebula emission spectra, in cases where particles in the mm-cm radius range might be solid and contribute significant mass and area, full Mie theory should be used. It appears that canonical mm-wavelength spectral slopes are more plausibly explained by solid, cm-size particles than larger, but more porous, aggregates.</p><p>To summarize, the model consists of equations 8 and (9 or 12), along with equation 13 as constrained by equations 15-17. These equations lead to a monochromatic opacity κ e,λ , which is then used to calculate a Rosseland mean κ R using equation 30. For calculation of mm-cm SEDs, only κ a R should be used (equation 4). Our treatment can assume either a heterogeneous "salt and pepper" particle size and compositional mix, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">or D'Alessio et al 2001</ref>, or a distribution of internally-mixed, homogeneous aggregate particles having arbitrary porosity (using equations 37 -42 in equations 8-17, and integrating with equation 23), as for instance modeled by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miyake and Nakagawa (1993)</ref>.</p><p>While derivations of the Rosseland mean opacity can be found in various sources, we provide here a quick derivation of κ R because it is surprisingly difficult to find good ones, and we make reference to some of its specific aspects. Essentially one derives an expression for the monochromatic flux in a high-opacity thermal radiation field, then integrates over frequency, and from this identifies the associated mean opacity. Start with the radiative transfer equation for monochromatic intensity I ν in a plane layered medium: µdI ν /dτ = S ν − I ν where S ν is the source function and τ ν is monochromatic optical depth measured normal to the layer, and µ = cosθ where θ here is the angle from the layer normal and dτ ν = κ ν dz where dz is an increment of thickness in the layer. In a medium of high optical depth where thermal radiation dominates everything else, I ν ≈ S ν ≈ B ν where B ν is the Planck function. Then we can rewrite the above equation to first order as I ν = B ν − dB ν /dτ . We then determine the local energy flux through the layer F ν = 2π 1 −1 I ν µdµ. In the presence of the gradient derived above, substituting for I ν :</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">F ν = 2π 1 −1 B ν µdµ − 1 −1 µdB ν κ ν dz µdµ . (26)</formula><p>The first integral vanishes because B ν =constant; the flux becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">F ν = − 2π κ ν dB ν dz 1 −1 µ 2 dµ = − 4π 3κ ν dB ν dz . (27)</formula><p>The standard trick is to set dB ν /dz = (dB ν /dT )(dT /dz).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B: Metal Particles</head><p>The small particle expansions of DL84, leading to our primary equations 8 and 9, incorporate only electric dipole terms. Similar expressions can be derived for magnetic dipole terms, which are more cumbersome in their full glory (see eg <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tanner 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">or Ossenkopf 1991</ref> and are usually approximated. For instance, DL84 (equation 3.27), citing <ref type="bibr">Landau and Lifshitz (1960 sections 45, 72, and 73)</ref>, give a handy first-order correction factor for Q a with the caveat that it is valid for small x, but without specific guidance as to what is "small". The correction is simply Q a (r, λ) = Q a (r, λ)(1 + F ), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">F = 2πr λ 2 ( 1 + 2) 2 + 2 2 90 ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>and 1 = n 2 r −n 2 i and 2 = 2n r n i (equation 7). Similar expressions appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ossenkopf (1991) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tanner (1984)</ref>, and surely elsewhere. The factor F gets very large when the refractive indices are large. In the case of iron metal, where n r and n i are nearly proportional to λ, the spectral behavior of equation 8 is flattened from x −3 nearly to x −1 , as can be seen by expanding terms in the large-refractive-index limit.</p><p>This magnetic dipole correction is insignificant in the mixed-material, aggregate particle case, as it only enters when the refractive indices of a particle are λ/r, so readers interested only in aggregate grains need not be concerned further with this term. Yet, for those who might be interested in clouds of metallic particles, the correction might be of interest. Unfortunately, it is formally only valid for particles that are small compared to the wavelength inside the particle, or equivalently the skin depth of the wave, which is given by x √ 1, and for the large of metals (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>) the allowed x is much smaller than the usual condition x = 2πr/λ 1. The correction is mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al (1994)</ref> but it is unclear from that paper just how it was used; their figure 2a shows results for metal particles having their standard size distribution in a wavelength range where it is not formally valid, and they give no comparison with Mie theory. We have found that if equation 31 is blithely applied for 2πr/λ &lt; 1, well out of its formal domain of validity, and the ensuing Q a is subject to our overall constraint Q a &lt; 1), the agreement with Mie calculations for pure metal is improved from nonexistent to marginal (figure 4). <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tanner (1984)</ref> has found similar behavior, in that use of the "approximation" outside of its formal domain of validity gives surprisingly better agreement with observed behavior than application of the more complete theory. This is not an argument for general acceptance of the approximation, and in any application where metal particles dominate the situation the complete Mie theory is probably required. Nevertheless, we have employed it in our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: Garnett Effective Medium Theory</head><p>In this appendix, we give an overview of the Garnett theory for the average complex dielectric constant () of an inhomogeneous medium. The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bohren and Huffman (1983)</ref> for a more complete exposition with background.</p><p>A number of exhaustive and sophisticated studies have compared several different kinds of EMT models to rigorous, brute-force numerical Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) models <ref type="bibr">(Perrin and Lamy 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">, Ossenkopf et al 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">, Stognienko et al 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">, Voshchinnikov et al 2005</ref>; see also Semenov et al 2003 and references therein); the differences are generally small and composition-dependent for small particles which can be treated using DDA (and much smaller than the huge differences due to growth which our model is primarily intended to capture). For instance, <ref type="figure">figure 16</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Voshchinnikov et al (2005)</ref> shows a nearly insignificant difference between Garnett and Bruggeman models relative to DDA calculations, in the regime where all scattering elements in the aggregates are truly small compared to the wavelength. Interestingly, they show that a model of their own device does a better job matching certain very porous aggregates containing monomers with a distribution of sizes (at least, at long wavelengths). We believe that both traditional EMT theories fail to match the "size distribution of inclusions" DDA results of Voshchinnikov et al 2005 <ref type="figure">figure 16</ref>, because the aggregates contain numerous embedded wavelength-sized monomers, which violate the assumptions of both EMT models (some of the monomer inclusions have diameter as large as the wavelength). For this situation to occur at wavelengths, particles, and temperatures of interest for Rosseland mean opacities of our paper would require monomers in the few-to-tens of micron size, that are in turn embedded by assumption in much larger particles -which our model would treat in the geometric optics limit in any case. In sections 5.3 and the Conclusions, we note deviations from our model when a significant fraction of the particles of interest are wavelength-sized (we anticipate this to be a problem mostly for mm-cm wavelength observations). The behavior is similar to that seen in <ref type="figure">figure 16</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Voshchinnikov et al (2005)</ref>.</p><p>We derive the components of = + ii and convert the results to the perhaps more familiar complex refractive index n + in . We then assess the realm of validity for a linear approximation of refractive index as a function of material density by comparing the two expressions for a range of component materials.</p><p>Interactions among different constituents of an inhomogeneous medium make the determination of an average dielectric constant problematic. The problem is generally insoluble, save by brute force (DDA) or approximation methods, and different approximations inevitably lead to different expressions. As an example, one choice that can be found in the literature as far back as 1850 is the Rayleigh expression that relates the density and dielectric constant of a powder to that of the corresponding solid. This result follows from the Clausius-Mosotti law that the quantity −1//+2 is proportional to the density of a material:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">1 ρ − 1 + 2 = 1 ρ o o − 1 o + 2 ,<label>(32)</label></formula><p>where o , ρ o are the complex dielectric constant and density of the solid material, and , ρ are those of the powder. This expression has been shown to be fairly accurate for powders made from various geological materials (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Campbell and Ulrichs 1969)</ref>. A more complete expression, which reduces to the Rayleigh formula in the case of one component, was derived by Maxwell Garnett (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Bohren and Hoffman 1983)</ref>. Garnett's model is that of inclusions of dielectric constant o embedded in a homogeneous medium of dielectric constant m . In the simplest version, the inclusions are assumed to be identical in composition, but may vary in shape, size, and orientation. Assuming that all the inclusions are spherical, the expression for the average dielectric constant is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">= m 1 + 3f o − m o + 2 m 1 − f o − m o + 2 m −1 ,<label>(33)</label></formula><p>where f is a mass fraction which is defined below. For m = 1, this reduces to the Rayleigh formula with f = ρ/ρ o (for a more detailed derivation, including nonsphericity effects, see <ref type="bibr">Bohren and Hoffman 1983)</ref>. The advantage of the Garnett equation is that it can be generalized to a multiple component medium. The general result can be cast into the same form as (33) except now f and o become f j and j , while the numerator and denominator of (33) are summed over j species <ref type="bibr">(Bohren and Hoffman 1983, Sect. 8.5)</ref>.</p><p>Noting that = + ii , we expand (33) into its complex parts, convert to fractional form, and separate the real and imaginary components:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">= + ii = 1 + 2 j f j σ j + i6 j f j γ j 1 − j f j σ j − i3 j f j γ j ,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>where we have defined σ j and γ j to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">σ j = ( j − 1)( j + 2) + 2 j ( j + 2) 2 + 2 j ,<label>(35)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_35">γ j = j ( j + 2) 2 + 2 j ,<label>(36)</label></formula><p>respectively.

We can determine f j in terms of mass fractions as follows: v kj is the kth volume element of species j so that the volume fraction of inclusions of species j is f j = k v kj /V . We define α j as the mass of all component j per unit nebula gas mass, and α = j α j is the mass fraction of all solids per unit nebula gas mass. With these definitions in mind,</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">f j = v j V = m j ρ j V = m j ρ ρ j M = ρ ρ j α j α = (1 − φ)ρα j ρ j α (43)</formula><p>where ρ is the average mass density of a composite particle; ρ can vary from nearly zero to the "solid" average value ρ at φ = 0. Using the last expression of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(43)</ref> in</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">j f j = f = 1 − φ gives ρ = α j (α j /ρ j ) .<label>(44)</label></formula><p>Under certain conditions, a simple linear approximation for the refractive index at a particular wavelength λ can greatly simplify calculations (see equations <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. Generally, such an approximation works well when n is of order unity (such as visible wavelengths).</p><p>Equations 22-23 follow from a simple, but approximate, extension of the so-called "Wiener rule" (Voshchinnikov et al 2005): = Σf j j , where j are the dielectric constants of the different materials j and the relation assumes lossless materials (n i = 0). Eqns 22-23 are simply the analogous linear volume averages applied to "moderate" refractive indices not far from unity, as is true for most silicates and ices. Assuming that the Wiener rule can be applied to a case where n i = 0, equations 22-23 can be derived in an approximate way, in the limit that n i 1 and n r = 1+δ with δ 2 2δ. Given = Σf j j , separate the real and imaginary parts of the sum recalling that = (n r + in i ) 2 , giving i = Σf j (2n i n r ) ∼ 2n r Σf j n ji . The LHS of the equation can also be approximated as 2n r n i , so n i ∼ Σf j n ji as in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(23)</ref>. Similarly r = (1 + δ) 2 ∼ 1 + 2δ, and on the RHS Σf j (1 + δ j ) 2 ∼ Σf j (1 + 2δ j ). Separating the sum on the RHS and noting that Σf j = 1, we get δ ∼ Σf j δ j as in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(22)</ref>. Of course, these are only approximations and valid only under the conditions stated.</p><p>Figure <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(12)</ref> shows a direct comparison of both the linear approximation and the generalized Garnett function, using the real and imaginary refractive indices of several combinations of likely materials at λ = 100 µm as a function of the density ratio ρ/ρ. Curve (a) corresponds to a single component of ice. Curves (b) and (c) are two-component mixtures of ice/rock and ice/iron. The fraction of iron is considerably less than the ice (see <ref type="table">Table)</ref>. Curve (d) is a three component mixture with the addition of troilite to ice and rock. Troilite also has a fairly large refractive index at this wavelength, which affects the linear approximation significantly. Curve (e) is a five component mixture with the contents of (d) augmented by iron and organics. The Garnett dielectric constant is unaffected by the minute amount of iron, as has been found by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ossenkopf 1991)</ref>, but the linear approximation diverges considerably because of iron's very high dielectric constant. This shows that metals, in general, are well beyond the realm of validity for the linear approximation.</p><p>The fractional mass and volume factors α j and f j discussed above are simply related to the particle number density weighting factors β j of section 4 (eg. equation 16ff). Recall that n(r) is the total number density of particles of all species, and if all the species have the same size distribution, the number density of particles of species j is n j (r) = β j n(r), where β j = 1. In the limit where the scattering and absorption by each species needs to be separately treated (physically, for particles small enough to be monomineralic), ρ j (r) = ρ j = constant. Then the total nebular mass density in species j is ρ pj = 4 3 πr 3 ρ j β j n(r)dr = ρ j β j 4 3 πr 3 n(r)dr = ρ j β j ξ,</p><p>where ξ is the nebula volume fraction of all solids. Recall that ρ p = ρ pj = αρ g , where α is the total mass fraction solid material. Therefore,</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">β j = ρ pj ξρ j = α j ρ g ξρ j = α j ρ g ρ ρ p ρ j ,<label>(46)</label></formula><p>where the last equality follows from ρ p ≡ αρ g = ρξ, since for the heterogeneous particle case we assume the particle porosity φ = 0. We previously defined the volume-averaged mass density of a compact particle as (44):</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">ρ = α j (α j /ρ j ) = ρ p ξ ;<label>(47)</label></formula><p>then and troilite, while curve (e) contains these three as well as organics and iron. Note that the the linear and Garnett correlate very poorly for mixtures that contain even small mixing ratios of elements with very high refractive indices. This message is also conveyed by <ref type="figure">figure  7</ref> and the associated discussion.</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">β j = α j ρ j ρ g ξ = α j ρ j ρ p ξα = α j ρ j ρ α = α j α ρ ρ j = α j ρ j j (α j /ρ j ) = f j 1 − φ ,<label>(48)</label></formula><p>so it is simply verified that j β j = 1. Moreover, equations (44) and (48) can be combined to give α j ρ = αβ j ρ j , and summing both sides over j leads to the intuitively obvious alternative expression ρ = j β j ρ j . All of the above quantities are obtained from the presumed compositional makeup of the protoplanetary nebula.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Variation of g = cosΘ (α = Θ and a = r in the notation of HT), and x = 2πr/λ, for a range of n r .

Several laboratory simulations of this process have shown that the resulting aggregates are of fairly low density (Donn 1990, Beckwith et al 2000). It has been noted that aggregates of this sort are fractals in the sense that their volume depends on their mass to an arbitrary power. Normally this relationship is expressed as m ∝ r s , where m is an individual particle mass and s is the fractal dimension (Wright 1987, Beckwith et al 2000, Dominik et al 2007). If the dimension is less than 3, their internal density decreases as the mass increases. Experimental results suggest that the internal densities and volume fractions of such particles are likely to be quite small, with porosities approaching 70% even after they begin compacting each other at increasing relative velocities (Weidenschilling 1997, Ormel et al 2008 and references therein). Growth of this sort is certain to be robust in giant planet atmospheres as well (Ackerman and Marley 2001, Helling et al 2008, Marley et al 2013 and references therein).</figDesc></figure>
