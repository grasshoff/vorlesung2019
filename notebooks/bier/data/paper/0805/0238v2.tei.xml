				<p>The light curve of an exoplanetary transit can be used to estimate the planetary radius and other parameters of interest. Because accurate parameter estimation is a non-analytic and computationally intensive problem, it is often useful to have analytic approximations for the parameters as well as their uncertainties and covariances. Here we give such formulas, for the case of an exoplanet transit-ing a star with a uniform brightness distribution. We also assess the advantages of some relatively uncorrelated parameter sets for fitting actual data. When limb darkening is significant, our parameter sets are still useful, although our analytic formulas underpredict the covariances and uncertainties.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The transit of an exoplanet across the face of its parent star is an opportunity to learn a great deal about the planetary system. Photometric and spectroscopic observations reveal details about the planetary radius, mass, atmosphere, and orbit, as reviewed recently by <ref type="bibr">Charbonneau et al. (2007)</ref>. Transit light curves, in particular, bear information about the planetary and stellar radii, the orbital inclination, and the mean density of the star <ref type="bibr">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">, Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Giménez 2007)</ref>. Additional planets in the system may be detected through gradual changes in the orbital parameters of the transiting planet <ref type="bibr">(Miralda-Escudé 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Heyl &amp; Gladman 2007</ref>, or from a pattern of anomalies in a collection of midtransit times <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Ford &amp; Holman 2007</ref>.</p><p>In general, the parameters of a transiting system and their uncertainties must be estimated from the photometric data using numerical methods. For example, many investigators have used χ 2 -minimization schemes such as AMOEBA or the Levenberg-Marquardt method, along with confidence levels determined by examining the appropriate surface of constant ∆χ 2 (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Alonso et al. 2004</ref>) or by bootstrap methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sato et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">, Winn et al. 2005</ref>). More recently it has become common to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holman et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Winn et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Burke et al. 2007</ref>). However, even when numerical algorithms are required for precise answers, it is often useful to have analytic approximations for the parameters as well as their uncertainties and covariances.</p><p>Analytic approximations can be useful for planning observations. For example, one may obtain quick answers to questions such as, for which systems can I expect to obtain the most precise measurement of the orbital inclination? Or, how many transit light curves will I need to gather with a particular telescope before the statistical error in the planetary radius is smaller than the systematic error? Now that nearly 50 transiting planets are known, we enjoy a situation in which a given night frequently offers more than one observable transit event. Analytic calculations can help one decide which target is more fruitfully observed, and are much simpler and quicker than the alternative of full numerical simulations. Analytic approximations are also useful for understanding the parameter degeneracies inherent in the model, and for constructing relatively uncorrelated parameter sets that will speed the convergence of optimization algorithms. Finally, analytic approximations are useful in orderof-magnitude estimates of the observability of subtle transit effects, such as transit timing variations, precession-induced changes in the transit duration, or the asymmetry in the ingress and egress durations due to a nonzero orbital eccentricity. <ref type="bibr">Mandel &amp; Agol (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Giménez (2007)</ref> have previously given analytic formulas for the received flux as a function of the relative separation of the planet and the star, but their aim was to provide highly accurate formulas, which are too complex for useful analytic estimates of uncertainties and covariances. <ref type="bibr">Protopapas et al. (2007)</ref> provided an analytic and differentiable approximation to the transit light curve, but they were concerned with speeding up the process of searching for transits in large databases, rather than parameter estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref> presented an approximate model of a transit light curve with the desired level of simplicity, but did not provide analytic estimates of uncertainties and covariances.</p><p>This paper is organized as follows. In § 2 we present a simple analytic model for a transit light curve, using a convenient and intuitive parameterization similar to that of <ref type="bibr">Seager &amp; Mallen-Ornelas (2003)</ref>. In § 3, we derive analytic approximations for the uncertainties and covariances of the basic parameters, and in § 4 we verify the accuracy of those approximations through numerical tests. Our model assumes that the flux measurements are made continuously throughout the transit, and that stellar limb-darkening is negligible; in § 4.1 and § 4.3 we check on the effects of relaxing these assumptions. In § 5 we derive some useful expressions for the uncertainties in some especially interesting or useful "derived" parameters, i.e., functions of the basic model parameters. In § 6 we present alternative parameter sets that are better suited to numerical algorithms for parameter estimation utilizing the analytic formalism given in § 3. We compare the correlations among parameters for various parameter sets that have been used in the transit literature. Finally, § 7 gives a summary of the key results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Linear approximation to the transit light curve</head><p>Imagine a spherical star of radius R ⋆ with a uniform brightness and an unocculted flux f 0 . When a dark, opaque, spherical planet of radius R p is in front of the star, at a center-tocenter sky-projected distance of zR ⋆ , the received stellar flux is F e (r, z, f 0 ) = f 0 (1−λ e (r, z)), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">λ e (r, z) =        0 1 + r &lt; z 1 π r 2 κ 0 + κ 1 − 4z 2 −(1+z 2 −r 2 ) 2 4 1 − r &lt; z ≤ 1 + r r 2 z ≤ 1 − r ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">with κ 1 = cos −1 [(1 − r 2 + z 2 )/2z] and κ 0 = cos −1 [(r 2 + z 2 − 1)/2rz] (Mandel &amp; Agol 2002).</formula><p>Geometrically, λ e is the overlap area between two circles with radii 1 and r whose centers are z units apart. The approximation of uniform brightness (no limb darkening) is valid for mid-infrared bandpasses, which are increasingly being used for transit observations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Harrington et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Knutson et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">, Deming et al. 2007</ref>, and is a good approximation even for near-infrared and far-red bandpasses. We make this approximation throughout this paper, except in § 4.3 where we consider the effect of limb darkening.</p><p>For a planet on a circular orbit, the relation between z and the time t is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z(t) = aR −1 ⋆ [sin n(t − t c )] 2 + [cos i cos n(t − t c )] 2 (2)</formula><p>where a is the semimajor axis, i is the inclination angle, n ≡ 2π/P is the angular frequency with period P , and t c is the transit midpoint (when z is smallest).</p><p>The four "contact times" of the transit are the moments when the planetary disk and stellar disk are tangent. First contact (t I ) occurs at the beginning of the transit, when the disks are externally tangent. Second contact (t II ) occurs next, when the disks are internally tangent. Third and fourth contacts (t III and t IV ) are the moments of internal and external tangency, respectively, as the planetary disk leaves the stellar disk. The total transit duration is t IV − t I . The ingress phase is defined as the interval between t I and t II , and likewise the egress phase is defined as the interval between t III and t IV . We also find it useful to define the ingress midpoint t ing ≡ (t I + t II )/2 and the egress midpoint t egr ≡ (t III + t IV )/2.</p><p>Although Eqns. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> give an exact solution, they are too complicated for an analytic error analysis. We make a few approximations to enable such an analysis. First, we assume the orbital period is large compared to transit duration, in which case Eqn. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is well-approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">z(t) = [(t − t c )/τ 0 ] 2 + b 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where, for a circular orbit, τ 0 = R ⋆ P/2πa = R ⋆ /na and b = a cos i/R ⋆ is the normalized impact parameter. In this limit, the planet moves uniformly in a straight line across the stellar disk. Simple expressions may be derived for two characteristic timescales of the transit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t egr − t ing = τ 0 (1 + r) 2 − b 2 + (1 − r) 2 − b 2 = 2τ 0 √ 1 − b 2 + O(r 2 ) (4) t II − t I = τ 0 (1 + r) 2 − b 2 − (1 − r) 2 − b 2 = 2τ 0 r √ 1 − b 2 + O(r 3 ).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>It is easy to enlarge the discussion to include eccentric orbits, by replacing a by the planetstar distance at midtransit, and n by the angular frequency at midtransit:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">a → a(1 − e 2 ) 1 + e sin ω , n → n(1 + e sin ω) 2 (1 − e 2 ) 3 2 ,</formula><p>where e is the eccentricity, and ω is the argument of pericenter. Here, too, we approximate the planet's actual motion by uniform motion across the stellar disk, with a velocity equal to the actual velocity at midtransit. Methods for computing these quantities at midtransit are discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Murray &amp; Dermott (2000)</ref>, as well as recent transit-specific studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes (2007)</ref>, Burke (2008), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ford et al. (2008)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gillon et al. (2007)</ref>.

Specifically, we define the parameters</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">δ ≡ f 0 r 2 = f 0 (R p /R ⋆ ) 2 (8) T ≡ 2τ 0 √ 1 − b 2 (9) τ ≡ 2τ 0 r √ 1 − b 2<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and then we define our model light curve as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F l (t) =    f 0 − δ |t − t c | ≤ T /2 − τ /2 f 0 − δ + δ τ (|t − t c | − T /2 + τ /2) T /2 − τ /2 &lt; |t − t c | &lt; T /2 + τ /2 f 0 |t − t c | ≥ T /2 + τ /2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>We use the symbol F l to distinguish this piecewise-linear model (l for linear) from the exact uniform-source expression F e given by Eqns. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>. The deviations between F l and F e occur near and during the ingress and egress phases. The approximation is most accurate in the limit of small r and b and is least accurate for grazing transits. As shown in Eqn. (5), when r is small, τ ≈ t II − t I (the ingress or egress duration) and T ≈ t egr − t ing (the total transit duration). Neither this piecewise-linear model nor the choice of parameters is new. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref> also used a piecewise-linear model, with different linear combinations of these parameters, and both <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref> have employed parameterizations that are closely related to the parameters given above. What is specifically new to this paper is an analytic error and covariance analysis of this linear model, along with useful analytic expressions for errors in the physical parameters of the system.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Fisher information analysis</head><p>Given a model F (t; {p i }) with independent variable t and a set of parameters {p i }, it is possible to estimate the covariance between parameters, Cov(p i , p j ), that would be obtained by measuring F (t) with some specified cadence and precision. (Gould 2003 gives a pedagogical introduction to this technique.) Suppose we have N data points taken at times t k spanning the entire transit event. The error in each data point is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable, with zero mean and standard deviation σ k .

The time dependence of the parameter derivatives for the exact uniform-source model F e is also shown, for comparison, as are the numerical derivatives for limb-darkenened light curves. This comparison shows that the linear model captures the essential features of more realistic models, and in particular the symmetries. The most obvious problem with the linear model is that it gives a poor description of the τ -derivative and the δ-derivative for the case of appreciable limb darkening, as discussed further in § 4.3. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. (2)</ref> and Table (1) we see that for the parameters T , τ , and δ, the derivatives are symmetric about t = t c , while the derivative for the parameter t c is antisymmetric about t c . This implies that t c is uncorrelated with the other parameters. (This is also the case for the exact model, with or without limb darkening.) We suppose that the data points are sampled uniformly in time at a rate Γ = N/T tot , where the observations range from t = t 0 to t = t 0 + T tot and encompass the entire transit event.

The second variable, θ, is approximately the ratio of ingress (or egress) duration to the total transit duration. The third variable, η, is approximately the ratio of the number of data points obtained during the transit to the number of data points obtained before or after the transit. Oftentimes, r and θ are much smaller than unity, which will later enable us to derive simple expressions for the variances and covariances, but for the moment we consider the general case.</p><p>Inverting B, we find the covariance matrix for the piecewise-linear model,</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Cov({t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 } , {t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 }) = 1 Q 2        θ 2 T 2 0 0 0 0 0 ηθ + 6−5θ 1−θ θT 2 η − 1 1−θ θ 2 T 2 η + 1 1−θ θδT ηθδT 0 η − 1 1−θ θ 2 T 2 ηθ + 2−θ 1−θ θT 2 η − 1 1−θ θδT ηθδT 0 η + 1 1−θ θδT η − 1 1−θ θδT η + 1 1−θ δ 2 ηδ 2 0 ηθδT ηθδT ηδ 2 ηδ 2        .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>The elements along the diagonal of the covariance matrix are variances, or squares of standard errors,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">σ p i = Cov(p i , p i ).</formula><p>This result can be simplified for the case when many out-of-transit observations are obtained and η → 0. In this limit, f 0 is known with negligible error, and we may assume f 0 = 1 without loss of generality.

(21)</formula><p>from which it is obvious that θ is the key controlling parameter that deserves special attention.

It is important to keep in mind that for b 0.5, θ is nearly equal to r and depends weakly on b. This implies that θ is expected to be quite small for most transiting systems. For planetary orbits that are randomly oriented in space, the expected distribution of b is uniform, and hence we expect θ 0.3 for 90% of a random sample of transiting planets with R p ≤ R Jup 2 . For this reason, in the following figures we use a logarithmic scale for θ, to emphasize the small values. In the limits η → 0 (errorless knowledge of f 0 ) and θ → r (small impact parameter), the expressions for the standard errors are especially simple:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">σ tc = Q −1 T θ/2, σ τ ≈ Q −1 T √ 6θ, σ T ≈ Q −1 T √ 2θ, σ δ ≈ Q −1 δ.<label>(23)</label></formula><p>In this regime, we have a clear hierarchy in the precision with which the time parameters are known, with σ tc &lt; σ T &lt; σ τ .</p><p>To further quantify the degree of correlation among the parameters, we compute the correlation matrix,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Corr({t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 } , {t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 }) = Cov(i, j) Cov(i, i)Cov(j, j) =            1 0 0 0 0 0 1 (β−1)θ √ (6−θ(5−β))(2−θ(1−β)) (β+1)θ 6−θ(5−β) βθ 6−θ(5−β) 0 (β−1)θ √ (6−θ(5−β))(2−θ(1−β)) 1 (β−1) √ θ √ (β+1)(2−θ(1−β)) βθ 2−θ(1−β) 0 (β+1)θ 6−θ(5−β) (β−1) √ θ √ (β+1)(2−θ(1−β)) 1 β β+1 0 βθ 6−θ(5−β) βθ 2−θ(1−β) β β+1 1            .(24)</formula><p>where we have defined β ≡ η(1 − θ) to simplify the resulting expression. For θ → 0, all correlations with f 0 vanish except for the correlation with δ. Due to the fact the correlation between δ and f 0 is ∝ β 1/2 , it remains large even for fairly small β. In the limit of η → 0 (β → 0), we remove all correlations with f 0 and have the remaining correlations depending only on the ratio θ:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">lim η→0 Corr(· , ·) =           1 0 0 0 0 0 1 − θ √ (6−5θ)(2−θ) θ 6−5θ 0 0 − θ √ (6−5θ)(2−θ) 1 − θ 2−θ 0 0 θ 6−5θ − θ 2−θ 1 0 0 0 0 0 1           .<label>(25)</label></formula><p>Correlations with f 0 decline with η as √ η.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. (5)</ref>, we have plotted the nonzero correlations as a function of θ for a few choices of η. The special case of η → 0 is plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. (6)</ref>. In the η → 0 limit, all correlations are small ( 0.3) over a large region of the parameter space. Thus, our choice of parameters provides a weakly correlated set for all but grazing transits (θ ∼ 1/2), as noted during the numerical analysis of particular systems by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. (2007)</ref>. One naturally wonders whether a different choice of parameters would give even smaller (or even zero) correlations. In § 6 we present parameter sets that are essentially uncorrelated and have other desirable properties for numerical parameter estimation algorithms.</p><p>The analytic formalism given in this section and more specifically the simple analytic covariance matrices in Eqns.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Comparison with covariances of the exact uniform-source model</head><p>We tested the accuracy of the covariance matrix based on the piecewise-linear model by (1) performing a numerical Fisher analysis of the exact uniform-source model, and also (2) applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of simulated data based on the exact uniform-source model. In both analyses, orbits are assumed to be circular. For the first task, we evaluated the analytic parameter derivatives of Eqn. (1), which are too cumbersome to be worth reproducing here, and numerically integrated Eqn. (17) to generate covariance matrices over a wide range of parameter choices. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. (2)</ref>, in § 2, shows the parameter derivatives for the exact model, as well as the piecewise-linear model and some limb-darkened light curves. For the second task, idealized data was generated by adding Gaussian noise with standard deviation σ/f 0 = 5 × 10 −4 to Eqn. (1) sampled at Γ = 100 (in units of the characteristic timescale τ 0 , Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>). With this sampling rate, approximately 50 samples occur during the ingress and egress phases. Approximately 10 4 links per parameter were generated with a Gibbs sampler and a Metropolis-Hasting jump-acceptance criterion. The jump-success fraction (the fraction of jumps in parameter space that are actually executed) was approximately 25% for all parameters. The effective length, defined as the ratio of the number of links to the correlation length (see the end of § 6 for the exact definition), was roughly 1000 − 2000 for the piecewise-linear model parameter set. More details on the MCMC algorithm are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tegmark et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ford (2005)</ref>. Standard errors were determined by computing the standard deviation of the resulting distribution for each parameter.

In practice this was done by choosing r = 0.05 and varying b across the full range of impact parameters. (The numerical analysis confirmed that the suitably-normalized covariances vary only as a function of θ ≡ τ /T , with the exception of slight δ-dependent positive offset in σ δ that goes to zero as δ goes to zero.) The MCMC analysis for η = 0 was accomplished by fixing the out of transit flux, f 0 = 1, and varying the remaining parameters We chose r = 0.1 for the MCMC analysis. <ref type="figure">Fig. (7)</ref> shows all of the nonzero numerical correlation matrix elements, as a function of θ.

We concluded from these tests that the errors in the analytic estimates of the uncertainties are generally small enough for the analytic error estimates derived from the piecewise-linear model to be useful.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Optimizing parameter sets for fitting data with small limb darkening</head><p>The parameter set {t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 } has the virtues of simplicity and weak correlation over most of the physical parameter space. However, when performing numerical analyses of actual data, the virtue of simplicity may not be as important as the virtue of low correlation, which usually leads to faster and more robust convergence. To take one example, lower correlations among the parameters result in reduced correlation lengths for Monte Carlo Markov Chains, and faster convergence to the desired a posteriori probability distributions, and can obviate the need for numerical Principal Component Analysis ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tegmark et al. 2004</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. (12)</ref>, we compare the degree of correlations for various parameter sets that have been used in the literature on transit photometry. Of note is the high degree of correlations among the "physical" parameter set {R ⋆ /a, R p /a, b}, which is a poor choice from the point of view of computational speed.  Nevertheless, one advantage of casting the model in terms of physical parameters is that the a priori expectations for those parameters are more easily expressed, such as a uniform distribution in b. The determinant of the Jacobian given by Eqn. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, |J|, is also useful in translating a priori probability distributions from one parameter set to the other [see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. (2007)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ford (2006)</ref> for an example of how this is done in practice]. For the case of the parameter set {t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 }, we may use the Jacobian, Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(30)</ref>, to convert a priori probability distributions via</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">p(t c , τ, T, δ, f 0 )dt c dτ dT dδ df 0 = p(t c , b 2 , τ 2 0 , r, f 0 ) 1 4 r θ f 0 dt c db 2 dτ 2 0 dr df 0 = p(t c , b, τ 0 , r, f 0 ) 1 4 r θ f 0 1 4 b τ 0 dt c db dτ 0 dr df 0 = p(t c , b, τ 0 , r, f 0 ) 1 − b 2 16 b r 2 τ 0 f 0 dt c db dτ 0 dr df 0 .

(34)</formula><p>One may use this expression to enforce a uniform prior in b, for example, by weighting the likelihood function as shown in Eqn. (33). However, there is a practical difficulty due to the singularity at b = 0. One way to understand the singularity is to note that uniform distributions in τ , T lead to a nearly uniform distribution in θ = τ /T , which highly disfavors b = 0; in order to enforce a uniform distribution in b, the prior must diverge at low b. <ref type="figure">Fig. (3)</ref> graphically captures the steep variation for small b with θ. Consider, instead, the parameter set {t c , b, T, r ≡ δ/f 0 , f 0 } where, from Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>, b 2 = 1 − rT /τ .

(36)</formula><p>The singularity at b = 0 has been removed with this parameter choice. There is a singularity at b = 1 instead, which is only relevant for near-grazing transits, and is not as strong of a singularity because of the square root. We confirm that this parameter set also enjoys weak correlations, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. (13)</ref>, and therefore this set is a reasonable choice for numerical parameter-estimation algorithms. The merits of other parameter sets, from the standpoint of correlation and a priori likelihoods, may be weighed in a similar fashion, using the simple analytic covariance matrix of Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">(20)</ref>, and the appropriate transformation Jacobian, in combination with Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">(29</ref> If the issues associated with the transformation of priors are ignored (i.e. if the data are of such quality that the results will depend negligibly on the priors), we can give essentially uncorrelated parameter sets. Consider, for example, the parameter set {t c , S e ≡ δ/τ, T, A ≡ δT }. The new parameter S e is the magnitude of the slope of the light curve during the ingress and egress phases, and the new parameter A is the area of the trapezoid defined by the transit portion of the light curve (i.e., the time integral of the flux decrement). For simplicity we assume η = 0 and fix f 0 = 1.

For the latter set, the only nonzero correlation is between Π and S e , which vanishes at θ = 0.1.</p><p>As a concrete example of the effectiveness of uncorrelated parameters, we apply the MCMC algorithm to simulated data. For a given choice of the parameter set, we generate chains with a fixed jump-success fraction, and calculate the resulting autocorrelations of the Markov chain. For a particular parameter p (with value p i at chain step i), the autocorrelation a at a given chain step j is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">a j = p i p i+j − −p i 2 p 2 i − −p i 2<label>(41)</label></formula><p>where the averages refer to the averages over the whole chain ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tegmark et al. 2004</ref>). The correlation length of the chain is the number of steps N that are required before the autocorrelation drops below 0.5. The total chain length divided by the correlation length is referred to as the effective length of a chain. The effective chain length is approximately the number of independent samples, which quantifies the degree of convergence of the algorithm. A lower correlation length, for the same total chain length, gives a more accurate final distribution. This autocorrelation analysis was performed for both the "physical" parameter set {t c , b 2 , τ 2 0 , r 2 } as well as the parameter sets {t c , τ, T, δ} and {t c , b, T, r}, with η = 0 in all cases (i.e., plentiful out-of-transit data). The MCMC was executed as detailed in § 4.2 with a fixed jump rate ≈50% for all parameter chains. (In practice this was achieved by adjusting the size of the Gaussian random perturbation that was added to each parameter at each trial step.) By choosing either the parameter set {t c , τ, T, δ} or {t c , b, T, r}, the correlation lengths are reduced by a factor of approximately 150. By using the minimally-correlated parameter set {t c , S e , T, A}, the correlation lengths are reduced by an additional factor of ∼2.</p><p>To completely eliminate the correlations between parameters, one can diagonalize the symmetric covariance matrix, Eqn. (37), and find the linear combinations of parameters that eliminates correlations. This was done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Burke et al. (2007)</ref> for the particular case of the transiting planet XO-2b. Analytic expressions for the eigenvectors are available because there are only two entangled parameters. However, these eigenvectors are linear combinations of local parameter values; they do not constitute a global transformation rendering the covariance diagonal. Thus, this procedure is useful for numerical analysis of a particular system, although not for analytic insights.</p></div>

We have verified the accuracy of the variance and covariance estimates derived from the piecewise-linear light curve with a numerical Fisher analysis of a more realistic (nonlinear) light-curve model, and with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of idealized data.</p><p>We focused on a particular parameterization of this piecewise-linear light curve that we believe to be most useful. The parameters are the midtransit time (t c ), the out-of-transit flux (f 0 ), the flux decrement during the full phase of the transit (δ), the duration of ingress or egress (τ ), and the duration between the midpoint of ingress and the midpoint of egress (T ). This set is observationally intuitive and gives simple analytic formulas for variances and covariances. The exact parameter definitions are provided in Eqns. <ref type="bibr">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref>) in terms of normalized impact parameter, stellar and planetary radii, semi-major axis and orbital period. Inverse mappings to more physical parameters are provided in Eqns. <ref type="bibr">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14)</ref>. The analytic covariance matrix is given in Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_19">(20)</ref> and the analytic correlation matrix is given in Eqn. <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. Some quick-and-dirty (but still rather accurate) expressions for the parameter uncertainties, for the case in which the planet is small, the out-of-transit flux is known precisely and limb darkening is negligible, are given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">σ tc = Q −1 T θ/2, σ τ ≈ Q −1 T √ 6θ, σ T ≈ Q −1 T √ 2θ, σ δ ≈ Q −1 δ</formula><p>where θ ≡ τ /T is the ratio of the ingress or egress duration to the total duration, and Q ≡ √ ΓT δ σ is the total signal-to-noise ratio of the transit in the small-planet limit (see <ref type="bibr">Eqn. 19</ref>).</p><p>We investigated the applicability of these results to a limb darkened brightness profile, in which the true light curve is not as well-described by a piecewise-linear function. We found that the analytic formulas underestimate some of the variances and covariances by a factor of a few, for a typical degree of limb darkening at optical wavelengths. Significant improvements to covariance estimates in the limb darkened case may be made by redefining the depth parameter as a function of darkening coefficient and impact parameter as in Eqn. <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. Unfortunately, no closed-form mapping to more physical parameters exists with this choice, and therefore most of the appeal of the analytic treatment is lost.</p><p>Quantities that are derived in part or in whole from the transit light curve (such as stellar mean density or exoplanet surface gravity) are provided in terms of the suggested parameter set. In <ref type="table">Table (</ref>2), uncertainties propagated from the covariance estimates for these quantities are provided with simple analytic formulas. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, covariance elements relevant to the uncertainties in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> are given for the case in which the planet is small and the out-oftransit flux is known precisely. This allows the uncertainty in a given physical parameter to be predicted in advance of any data, bypassing the need for time-consuming simulations. For transit surveys, these formulas may also be useful in giving closed-form expressions for the expected distributions for some of the key properties of a sample of transiting planets.</p><p>In § 6, with the tools provided, we approach the question of what parameter sets are best suited to numerical parameter estimation codes. This question depends both on the level of parameter correlation and the behavior of any a priori likelihood functions. We advocated a parameter set that has the virtue of both weak correlation and essentially uniform a priori expectations: specifically, the parameters are the midtransit time, the out-of-transit flux, the ratio of planetary to stellar radii (R p /R ⋆ ), the normalized impact parameter, and the duration between the midpoint of ingress and the midpoint of egress. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. (13)</ref> graphically describes the parameter correlations while Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(36)</ref> gives the a priori probability distribution. Finally, two parameter choices are given that are less intuitive than the suggested set but that provide smaller correlations, depending on information that may be inferred or guessed prior to analysis. Correlations may be tuned to zero with the second parameter choice for a non-grazing transit and an estimate of R p /R ⋆ . The resulting correlation matrices for both parameter choices are given in Eqns. <ref type="bibr">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr">39)</ref>. Lower correlations relate directly to more efficient data fitting, as demonstrated by reduced correlation lengths with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FluxFig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Comparison of the exact and piecewise-linear transit models, for the parameter choice r = 0.2, b = 0.5.

The time dependence of the parameter derivatives for the exact uniform-source model F e is also shown, for comparison, as are the numerical derivatives for limb-darkenened light curves. This comparison shows that the linear model captures the essential features of more realistic models, and in particular the symmetries. The most obvious problem with the linear model is that it gives a poor description of the τ -derivative and the δ-derivative for the case of appreciable limb darkening, as discussed further in § 4.3. From Fig. (2) and Table (1) we see that for the parameters T , τ , and δ, the derivatives are symmetric about t = t c , while the derivative for the parameter t c is antisymmetric about t c . This implies that t c is uncorrelated with the other parameters. (This is also the case for the exact model, with or without limb darkening.)</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> In computing these derivatives we have ignored the dependence of the piecewise boundaries in Table. (1) on the parameter values. The derivatives associated with those boundary changes are finite, and have a domain of measure zero in the limit of continuous sampling. Thus they do not affect our covariance calculation.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In fact, the fraction of discovered systems with θ 0.3 may be even larger than 90%, because selection effects make it harder to detect grazing transits.</note>
