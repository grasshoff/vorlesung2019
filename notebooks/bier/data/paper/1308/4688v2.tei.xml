				<p>We assess the multi-planet systems discovered by the Kepler satellite in terms of current ideas about orbital migration and eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interactions. Our primary focus is on first-order mean motion resonances, which we investigate analytically to lowest order in eccentricity. Only a few percent of planet pairs are in close proximity to a resonance. However, predicted migration rates (parameterized by τ n = n/| ˙ n|) imply that during convergent migration most planets would have been captured into first order resonances. Eccentricity damping (parameterized by τ e = e/| ˙ e|) offers a plausible resolution. Estimates suggest τ e /τ n ∼ (h/a) 2 ∼ 10 −2 , where h/a is the ratio of disk thickness to radius. Together, eccentricity damping and orbital migration give rise to an equilibrium eccentricity, e eq ∼ (τ e /τ n) 1/2. Capture is permanent provided e eq µ 1/3 , where µ denotes the planet to star mass ratio. But for e eq µ 1/3 , capture is only temporary because librations around equilibrium are overstable and lead to passage through resonance on timescale τ e. Most Kepler planet pairs have e eq &gt; µ 1/3. Since τ n ≫ τ e is the timescale for migration between neighboring resonances, only a modest percentage of pairs end up trapped in resonances after the disk disappears. Thus the paucity of resonances among Kepler pairs should not be taken as evidence for in situ planet formation or the disruptive effects of disk turbulence. Planet pairs close to a mean motion resonance typically exhibit period ratios 1-2% larger than those for exact resonance. The direction of this shift undoubtedly reflects the same asymmetry that requires convergent migration for resonance capture. Permanent resonance capture at these separations from exact resonance would demand µ(τ n /τ e) 1/2 0.01, a value that estimates of µ</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As of January 2013, more than 3000 planet candidates have been discovered by the Kepler spacecraft and over 1000 of these reside in systems that contain more than one planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). Thanks to these remarkable findings, we now have a large statistical sample of multi-planet systems. Their architectures contain important clues concerning planet formation and dynamical evolution. Kepler multi-planet systems display the following characteristics:</p><p>• Most planets do not reside in or close to mean motion resonances as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  1</ref> ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>• There is a significant excess of planet pairs with period ratios close to but slightly larger (by 1-2%) than that for exact resonance (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fabrycky et al. (2012)</ref>).</p><p>Several papers have been published offering explainations for the 1-2% offset from mean motion resonance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lithwick &amp; Wu 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batygin &amp; Morbidelli 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Petrovich et al. 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baruteau &amp; Papaloizou 2013</ref>). Our investigation has a different focus. We aim to explain why mean motion resonances are rare. This is surprising because planet-disk interactions leading to orbit migration are expected to result in efficient resonance capture (see section 2.2 and <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). However, we show that for most Kepler planet pairs, resonance capture is only temporary. The reason is that librations about exact resonance are overstable and lead to passage through resonance on the eccentricity damping timescale which is about two orders of magnitude shorter than that for semi-major axis migration (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ward 1988)</ref>.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows. §2 focuses on the planar, circular, restricted threebody problem in the vicinity of a mean motion resonance including resonance capture in the presence of semi-major axis migration and eccentricity damping and the evolution within and   escape from resonance. We show that together, eccentricity damping and orbit migration give rise to an equilibrium eccentricity and that librations around equilibrium are overstable for the majority of Kepler planet masses and lead to passage through resonance. We extend our model to the planar, three-body problem in §3. Results derived from our model are compared with properties of multi-planet systems discovered by the Kepler Spacecraft in §4. In §5 we discuss reasons for the departure from exact resonance and show that our resonance model yields an excess of pairs with slightly greater than exact resonant period ratios, but that the magnitude of the offset from exact resonance is on average too small to match observations. We compare our findings with previous works that aim to explain the period offset. Our main conclusions are summarized in §6</p></div>

Although we first examine resonance dynamics without dissipation, terms describing tidally induced migration and eccentricity damping are included in order to avoid having to repeat these equations later on. The final term in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> accounts for the contribution of eccentricity damping to changes in mean motion. For the particular case of eccentricity damping arising from energy dissipation at constant angular momentum, as applies to tides raised in a planet by its parent star, p ≈ 3. For simplicity, we assume p = 3 throughout the body of our paper but provide results applicable for general p &gt; 0 in the Appendix.</p><p>For the remainder of this subsection, we neglect both migration and eccentricity damping and work in the limit τ n &amp; τ e → ∞.

For k &gt; k crit the level curve emanating from the unstable fixed point is appropriately called a separatrix because it separates the regions surrounding the two stable fixed points.

The stable and unstable fixed points at φ = π bifurcate at k = k crit where e crit = (βµ ′ /3j 2 ) 1/3 . These values correspond to the boundary between stable and unstable linear oscillations around φ = π, e = βµ ′ n/((j + 1)n ′ − jn) as can be verified from equation (5). In anticipation of later discussion, we make note of the asymmetry of the stable fixed points on opposite sides of exact resonance.</p><p>Note that near resonance, e = O(µ ′1/3 ) and d/dt = O(µ ′2/3 n). Thus the first and second terms on the rhs of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(5)</ref> dominate over the third for small amplitude librations (i.e., φ = δφ &lt;&lt; 1). Moreover, librations of φ are centered on φ = 0, e = e 0 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Murray &amp; Dermott 1999</ref>) where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">e 0 = βµ ′ n jn − (j + 1)n ′ .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>From equation (5), it follows that the frequency of small librations, ω, satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ω 2 n 2 = 3j 2 βµ ′ e 0 + βµ ′ e 0 2 .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Planet-Disk Interactions</head><p>Up to this point, migration and eccentricity damping were merely parametrized by their respective timescales τ n and τ e .

Here we have assumed that the planet's mass is too small for it to clear a gap in the disk. The migration rate is based on the balance of torques at principal Lindblad resonances located interior and exterior to the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ward 1986</ref>). Eccentricity damping in a gapless disk is dominated by first order, coorbital Lindblad resonances <ref type="bibr">(Ward 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Artymowicz 1993)</ref>. These come in pairs with individual members approximately equally spaced interior and exterior to the coorbital location. Consequently, each pair damps the planet's orbital energy at nearly constant angular momentum. However, remote first order Lindblad resonances along with coronation resonances also contribute to eccentricity excitation and damping. Thus the coefficient p in equation (2) may deviate from 3. For example, the plant-disk model investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tanaka &amp; Ward (2004)</ref> yields p ∼ 1.3. Overstable librations require that the final term in equation (2) be positive as shown by equation (A2).</p></div>

Capture would be guaranteed provided the orbital eccentricity of the inner body far from the resonance were sufficiently small and the rate of outward migration sufficiently slow. Let us assume that the former condition is satisfied. Then upon approach to resonance, the inner planet would stay close to the stable fixed point at φ = 0 and e 0 = βµ ′ n/(jn − (j + 1)n ′ ). As the resonance is approached, ω first decreases and then increases (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>).

The local disk mass, µ d , is that which resides within a factor of two of the planet's orbital radius. For a total disk mass equal to 10 −2 M * distributed with a radial surface density profile ∝ a −1 , the local disk mass at 0.5 AU is two orders of magnitude smaller than the local disk mass at 50 AU. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> indicates that resonance capture will only occur for local disk masses less than 10 −3 M * . Thus in a typical disk with total mass 10 −2 M * and an a −1 surface density profile, only planets within about 10AU would be caught into resonance. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> further suggests planets with masses between those of Earth and Neptune which orbit within 1AU have the best chances to capture smaller planets.</p><p>To a significant extent, the current situation regarding mean motion resonances among pairs of exoplanets is analogous to that which pertained to mean motion resonances in the satellite systems of Jupiter and Saturn more than half a century ago. A early paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Roy &amp; Ovenden (1954)</ref> called attention to the overabundance of orbital resonances among the satellite systems of Jupiter and Saturn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goldreich (1965)</ref> showed that slow convergent migration driven by tides raised in a planet would lead to the formation of mean motion resonances stabilized by the transfer of angular momentum from the inner to the outer satellite. Early work emphasized slow migration because it is appropriate to cases in which tidal torques drive the expansion of satellite orbits. The probability of capture into resonance for slow convergent migration was first solved by <ref type="bibr">Yoder (1979)</ref>. Subsequently, simpler derivations emphasizing the role of adiabatic invariance were provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henrard (1982)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borderies &amp; Goldreich (1984)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Evolution in Resonance in the Presence of Migration</head><p>Provided that the migration is sufficiently slow such that resonant capture occurs, the orbital eccentricity e 0 keeps growing on a timescale comparable to the migration timescale, τ n , as the planet moves deeper into resonance (e.g. Malhotra 1993; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee &amp; Peale 2002)</ref>. Once the eccentricity has grown to order unity, the system becomes unstable leading to passes through resonance, collision or ejection (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee &amp; Peale 2002)</ref>. Since the eccentricity growth in resonance occurs on a timescale comparable to τ n this implies that planets should share their time roughly equally between residing in mean motion resonances and migrating between them. Thus at any given time, about half of all planet pairs should occupy mean motion. This implies that in the presence of migration that about half of all planet pairs should occupy mean motion resonances at any given moment in time, which is not consist with the observed period rations of Kepler planet pairs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>).

This argument rests on the assumption that semi-major axes are largely frozen during and subsequent to disk dispersal.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">fig. 11)</ref> resonance. Resonant arguments for those above the solid red lines would be damped whereas those located below it would be overstable. Most of the planet pairs lie below the dashed red lines. These might have undergone temporary capture but would have escaped from resonance on timescale τ e&lt; . The fate of the pairs between the dashed and solid lines is less certain. For many, the eccentricity damping timescale, τ e&lt; , is so short that escape would be probable as found in our numerical integrations summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Given that planet pairs which ultimately escape resonance only spend a time τ e&lt; in each resonance but about a time τ n&gt; between successive resonances, the fraction temporarily captured planet pairs in or near mean motion resonances is τ e&lt; /τ n&gt; ∼ 0.01µ &gt; /µ &lt; which evaluates to 3% for the Kepler 2-planet sample. Perhaps a comparable or even slightly greater percent might have been permanently captured.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows that peaks associated with period ratios close to 2 : 1 and 3 : 2 are systematically displaced to larger values by of order 1 − 2%. The direction of displacement is almost certainly due to the asymmetry that requires convergent migration for capture in resonance. However, its magnitude is less easily accounted for. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  12</ref> which shows that to match a 1% average offset from exact 2 : 1 resonance requires a permanently captured test particle to be paired with a planet for which µ 2 ∼ 4 × 10 −4 . More generally, test particles paired in mean motion resonances with massive planets would have period ratios offset from exact resonance by ∼ j 1/3 µ 2/3 2 (cf. eqn. 19). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Petrovich et al. (2013)</ref> arrive at similar mass requirements and scalings from a model in which planets grow in mass at a prescribed rate without orbital migration or eccentricity damping. Period offsets for planets temporarily caught in resonance that might remain close to resonance after the disk dissipates would be smaller still. These considerations strongly suggest that the departure from exact resonance observed in the Kepler data occurred either during or after the protoplanetary disk disappeared.</p></div>

Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baruteau &amp; Papaloizou (2013)</ref> finds that interactions between a planet and the wake of a companion can reverse convergent migration and significantly increase the period ratio away from the resonant value. They suggest that this may help to account for the diversity of period ratios in Keplers multiple planet systems.</p><p>If a planetesimal disk contains a significant mass, interactions between the planets and the disk may lead to significant damping of orbital eccentricities. The resonant structure of the Kuiper Belt and the 'late veneer' found on Earth, Moon and Mars provide evidence for a leftover planetesimal disk in our solar system that was still present at the end of planet formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schlichting et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In some instances, interactions with a particle disk can be considered in analogy to those with a gaseous disk. If the disk were composed of small bodies, collisions might maintain the ratio of its thickness to radius at a much lower value than typical of a gaseous disk. This could lower τ e /τ n and perhaps provide sufficient eccentricity damping to match the observed offsets from exact resonance. However, this proposal is plagued by uncertainty. Gaps are easily opened in disks with small velocity dispersion and the absence of material corotating with the planet would eliminate eccentricity damping associated with coorbital Lindblad resonances. Coorbital Lindblad resonances dominate eccentricity damping during type I migration.</p><p>By virtue of their slow detuning away from exact resonance, apsidal waves launched at a secular resonance can propagate in low optical depth disks where waves associated with other Lindblad resonances cannot <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Goldreich &amp; Tremaine 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ward &amp; Hahn 1998)</ref>. That an apsidal wave transports negative angular momentum follows from the fact that it excites the eccentricities of disk particles while hardly affecting their energies. As a consequence, the excitation of the apsidal wave damps the planet's orbital eccentricity. There is no difficulty conjuring up reasonable scenarios in which the apsidal wave is responsible for damping a planet's orbital eccentricity by a few orders of magnitude within the timescale that the particle disk might survive destruction or accretion onto planets and the central star. However, just as for damping by dynamical friction, uncertainties abound. Foremost among them are the mass and lifetime of the particle disk, the particle size distribution, and the radial dependence of the apsidal precession rate. We leave these issues for a future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our investigation is predicated on the assumption that the orbits of the Kepler planets were largely determined by processes that operated within their protoplanetary disks and that they have undergone little modification since it disappeared. That τ e /τ n , which depends on temperature but is independent of disk surface density, plays a central role in the outcome of evolution in resonance is consistent with, but far from a proof that this assumption is valid. Given this starting point, we argue that the small fraction of Kepler pairs found close to mean motion resonance is compatible with standard estimates for the rates of orbital migration and eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interactions. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows that capture into first-order mean motion resonance during convergent migration must have been a common occurrence given the observed orbital parameters and estimated planet masses. However, as the result of eccentricity damping, permanent capture in resonance was rare. Most captures were only temporary with durations of order τ e which is short in comparison to the timescale τ n for migration between neighboring resonances. The temporary nature of resonance capture is due to the overstability of librations of the resonant argument about the tidal equilibrium given by equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref>.-Histogram of the period distribution for a planet pair permanently trapped in the 2:1 resonance and undergoing a large amplitude libration consistent with parameter values µ 1 = 0, µ 2 = 4 × 10 −4 , and τ e1 /τ n2 = 0.022. Period ratios exceed the precise resonance value of 2 by up to 1.5%. The intrinsic asymmetry about exact resonance is responsible for the deficit of period ratios short of 2:1. However, as seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>, only a few Kepler pairs near the 2:1 resonance have µ 2 as large as 4 × 10 −4 . Thus it appears that additional sources of eccentricity damping must have occurred during or after the disk disappeared.</p><p>of disk turbulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rein 2012</ref>).</p><p>The resonance model and our analytic solutions presented here only include the lowest order term in eccentricity. The assumption of small eccentricities seems to be justified for the majority of Kepler systems given that estimates for typical disk parameters yield equilibrium eccentricities smaller than 0.1.</p><p>The overstability criterion described in §2.4.1 is the major technical accomplishment of our paper. Permanent resonance capture is possible if tidal equilibrium occurs at large enough separation from resonance so that a separatrix is not present. As indicated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures  10 and 11</ref>, only the most massive Kepler planets are likely to be permanently captured in resonance.

The subscripts &lt; and &gt; refer to the smaller and larger of the two planets, respectively. These ratios were calculated based on the assumption that each planet has a mean density of 2 g cm −3 . Planet pairs above the dashed red lines are candidates for permanent capture in the 2 : 1 (fig. 10) and 3 : 2 (fig. 11) resonance. Resonant arguments for those above the solid red lines would be damped whereas those located below it would be overstable. Most of the planet pairs lie below the dashed red lines. These might have undergone temporary capture but would have escaped from resonance on timescale τ e&lt; . The fate of the pairs between the dashed and solid lines is less certain. For many, the eccentricity damping timescale, τ e&lt; , is so short that escape would be probable as found in our numerical integrations summarized in Figure 7. Given that planet pairs which ultimately escape resonance only spend a time τ e&lt; in each resonance but about a time τ n&gt; between successive resonances, the fraction temporarily captured planet pairs in or near mean motion resonances is τ e&lt; /τ n&gt; ∼ 0.01µ &gt; /µ &lt; which evaluates to 3% for the Kepler 2-planet sample. Perhaps a comparable or even slightly greater percent might have been permanently captured.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head>Fig. 11 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig. 10.-Planet to Star mass ratio, µ ′ , as a function of the smaller to larger planet mass ratio, m &lt; /m &gt; , for all Kepler 2-planet systems known as of June 2013 (blue points). Large green filled circles correspond to planet pairs with period ratios ranging from 1.99 to 2.075. See Figure 1 for comparison. Planet pairs above the red dashed line can be permanently captured into resonance. The solid red line marks the transition from damping to growth for a 2:1 mean motion resonance as given by equation (44) assuming τ e&lt; /τ n&lt; = τ e&gt; /τ n&gt; = 0.01. Pairs located above the solid red line would have damped resonant arguments (9%), whereas resonant arguments of those between the dashed and red lines should have undergone finite amplitude librations (20%). The vast majority of pairs might have been temporarily captured in resonances but would have subsequently escaped. Even many pairs located between the dashed and solid lines might have only been captured temporarily as we found for systems with short eccentricity damping timescales, τ e&lt; , in Figure 7.</figDesc></figure>
