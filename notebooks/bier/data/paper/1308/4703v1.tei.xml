			<abstract>
				<p>The space-borne observatories CoRoT (Convection Rotation and planetary Transits) and Kepler have provided photometric time series data of unprecedented precision for large numbers of stars. These data have revolutionized the fields of transiting exoplanets and asteroseismology. In this review some important asteroseismic results obtained using data from the CoRoT and Kepler space missions concerning stars that show solar-like oscillations are discussed. These results comprise, among others, measurements of the location of the base of the convection zone and helium second-ionization zone in main-sequence stars, the presence (or not) of core-helium burning in red-giant stars, as well as differential rotation in these stars.</p>

In this mechanism 118 a particular layer in the star gains heat during the compression part of the 119 oscillation cycle. This usually occurs in partially ionized layers of elements 120 with high opacity, such as hydrogen, helium, or iron. Inside these partially 121 ionized layers the energy, which would normally heat the zone, mostly goes 122 into increasing the ionization as the star is compressed. This increases the 123 opacity of the zone, trapping radiation more efficiently, and resulting in out- 124 ward pressure. The zone is then driven outwards, cooling as it rises, which 125 increases the opacity and outward pressure. Further cooling of the zone 126</figDesc></figure>

For a recent extensive overview of solar-like oscillators see Chaplin 148 and Miglio (2013). In addition to the oscillations the convection also pro- 149 duces a convective background on which the p-mode spectrum is seated. See 150 Mathur et al. (2011b) for a description and characterization of the convective 151 background. 152 The stochastic driving and damping of solar-like oscillations results in a 153 finite mode lifetime (few minutes to about hundred days) of the oscillation 154 modes. This finite mode lifetime is visible as a typical width in the peaks 155 representing the oscillations in the Fourier spectrum, with shorter lifetimes 156 resulting in wider peaks. Additionally, in stochastic oscillators essentially all 157 modes are excited albeit with different amplitudes. This results in a clear 158 pattern of overtones in the Fourier spectrum (see top panel of Figure 2). This 159 is of great value for identifying the oscillation modes.</figDesc></figure>

The solid lines show average observable period spacings for ASTEC (ChristensenDalsgaard, 2008) models of hydrogen-shell-burning giants on the red-giant branch as they evolve from right to left. The black stars show theoretical period spacings calculated in the same way, for four models of helium-core-burning stars that are midway through that phase (core-helium fraction 50%). The 2.4 M model was calculated with ASTEC and commenced helium-burning without passing through a helium flash. The other three models, which did undergo a helium flash, were computed using the ATON code (Ventura et al., 2008). Solar metallicity was adopted for all models, which were computed without mass loss. Figure adapted from Bedding et al. (2011).</figDesc></figure>

(2011). From these 353 mixed modes the period spacings (see Eq. 6) can be derived. Bedding et al. 354 (2011) and Mosser et al. (2011a) showed that the observed period spacings 355 of red giants in the hydrogen-shell-burning phase ascending the red-giant 356 branch is significantly different from the period spacing for red giants also 357 burning helium in the core. This provides a clear separation into these two 358 groups of stars that are superficially very similar (see Figure 3). This effect 359 was explained by Christensen-Dalsgaard (2011) as being due to convection 360 in the central regions of the core in the helium-burning stars. The buoyancy 361 frequency (N ) is nearly zero in the convective region. As the period spacing 362</figDesc></figure>

(2010) studied the internal structure 384 of the CoRoT target HR 7349 from frequencies obtained by Carrier et al. 385 (2010). Miglio et al. (2010) interpreted a periodic component in the oscil- 386 lation frequencies as caused by a local depression of the sound speed that 387 occurs in the helium second-ionization region at a relative acoustic radius 388 of ∼0.55 (in the Sun the helium second-ionization region lies at a relative 389 acoustic radius of ∼0.83 and the base of the convection zone at a relative 390 acoustic radius of ∼0.4). Subsequently, Mazumdar et al. (2012a) studied the 391 sharp internal structure changes of HD49933 and were able to find both the 392 signatures of the helium second-ionization zone and of the base of the con- 393 vective envelope. Similar studies of 19 stars observed with Kepler found that 394 the extracted locations of the layers of sharp variation in sound speed are 395 consistent with representative models of these stars (e.g. Mazumdar et al., 396 2012b).</figDesc></figure>

This number increased significantly with CoRoT and Kepler 400 data. For example, with CoRoT the number of red giants with detected 401 solar-like oscillations increased from three to hundreds. These large numbers 402 allowed for the first time to investigate an ensemble of stars as a whole, i.e., 403 to perform statistical studies of intrinsic stellar properties (such as mass and 404 radius) and to test theories of stellar evolution. Such "ensemble asteroseis- 405 mology" studies were performed by e.g. Hekker et al. (2009); Huber et al. 406 (2010); Kallinger et al. (2010); Mosser et al. (2010). These studies led, among 407 others, to observational evidence for a tight correlation between ν max and ∆ν 408 (Hekker et al., 2009; Stello et al., 2009; Mosser et al., 2010). Additionally, it 409 was found that oscillations in red giants follow a universal pattern (Mosser 410 et al., 2011b). Furthermore, investigations of properties, such as the am- 411 plitudes of the oscillations, as a function of evolution have been presented 412 (Huber et al., 2010). Miglio et al. (2009) followed this up with a comparison 413 of the observed distribution of the large frequency separation with distribu- 414 tions from different synthetic populations showing that it is not likely that a 415 recent starburst has taken place in our part of the Milky Way.</figDesc></figure>

Data from these satellites revealed, among others, the 440 possibility to distinguish between red-giant branch stars and red-clump stars, 441 to determine differential rotation between the core and the outer layers of the 442 stars, as well as the location of sharp internal structure changes in stars other 443 than the Sun. Nevertheless, there exist still open questions such as, what 444 are the ages of stars, or how do the large variety of planetary systems form. 445 To answer these questions dedicated efforts for several new instruments are 446 underway: 447 • BRITE-Constellation (BRIght Target Explorer) is a network of nano- 448 satellites with different colour filters to investigate the properties of the 449 brightest stars in the sky (Kaiser et al., 2012). The Austrian BRITE- 450 satellites have been launched successfully on February 25, 2013. 451 • On April 5, 2013, NASA announced the selection of the Transiting Ex- 452 oplanet Survey Satellite (TESS</figDesc></figure>

These efforts are necessary to fully under- 495 stand the internal structures of stars including their ages and planet forma- 496 tion scenarios. 497 498 Finally, the CoRoT and Kepler legacy is a truly incredible amount of very 499 high quality data. These data are of unprecedented quality in terms of signal- 500 to noise ratio, continuity and total length of the timeseries as well as the vast 501 number and range of different stars. The analysis and interpretation of these 502 data will continue to reveal important results. These add to the wealth of 503 results already obtained and (partly) described in this review, indicating the 504 significant impact of asteroseismic results from CoRoT and Kepler on our 505 understanding of stellar structure and evolution. 506 5.
