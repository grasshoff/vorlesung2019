				<p>We present both the technical overview and main science drivers of the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (hereafter OGLE-IV). OGLE-IV is currently one of the largest sky variability surveys worldwide, targeting the densest stellar regions of the sky. The survey covers over 3000 square degrees in the sky and monitors regularly over a billion sources. The main targets include the inner Galactic Bulge and the Magellanic System. Their photometry spans the range of 12 &lt; I &lt; 21 mag and 13 &lt; I &lt; 21.7 mag, respectively. Supplementary shallower Galaxy Variability Survey covers the extended Galactic bulge and 2/3 of the whole Galactic disk within the magnitude range of 10 &lt; I &lt; 19 mag. All OGLE-IV surveys provide photometry with milli-magnitude accuracy at the bright end. The cadence of observations varies from 19-60 minutes in the inner Galactic bulge to 1-3 days in the remaining Galactic bulge fields, Magellanic System and the Galactic disk. OGLE-IV provides the astronomical community with a number of real time services. The Early Warning System (EWS) contains information on two thousand gravitational microlensing events being discovered in real time annually, the OGLE Transient Detection System (OTDS) delivers over 200 supernovae a year. We also provide the real time photometry of unpredictable variables such as optical counterparts to the X-ray sources and R Coronae Borealis stars. Hundreds of thousands new variable stars have already been discovered and classified by the OGLE survey. The number of new detections will be at least doubled during the current OGLE-IV phase. The survey was designed and optimized primarily to conduct the second generation microlens-ing survey for exoplanets. It has already contributed significantly to the increase of the discovery rate of microlensing exoplanets and free-floating planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is a long-term largescale photometric sky survey focused on sky variability. Established at the beginning of 1990s the project has continuously been providing important discoveries in a variety of fields of modern astrophysics -already for more than 22 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>The OGLE sky survey began regular sky monitoring on April, 12, 1992 as one of the first generation microlensing sky surveys. <ref type="bibr">Followed Paczy´nskiPaczy´nski's (1986)</ref> ideas on the properties and detection rates of gravitational microlensing events in our Galaxy as well as proposed by him application of microlensing for the search for dark matter in the Galactic halo, the first generation microlensing projects (MA-CHO, EROS, OGLE) started at that time hunting for these extremely rare phenomena. These searches required a completely new strategy of conducting observations -long-term (years-long) monitoring of the densest stellar regions in the sky (Magellanic Clouds, Galactic center and disk). Fast identification of the first microlensing events <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alcock et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr">-LMC, Udalski et al. 1993</ref> -Galactic bulge) encouraged further intensive observations. Nevertheless, it took almost two decades before the final microlensing results on the dark matter content in the halo finally ruled out low mass objects as a significant component of the Galactic halo <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alcock et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Tisserand et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>The first generation microlensing surveys were in fact the first large scale variability surveys. Huge photometric databases of millions of stars observed for several years became a unique source of data for studying variability of the sky. Main microlensing targets, the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic bulge, described often as the main astrophysical laboratories, provided millions of interesting objects of all variability types for which precise photometry could be retrieved as a byproduct of these programs. For the first time astronomers could analyze not only single objects of a class but also large statistical samples of different types of stars.</p><p>The OGLE survey itself was evolving in the last two decades. The first phase, OGLE-I, was conducted in the years 1992-1995 at the Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, with the 1.0-m Swope telescope equipped with a single chip CCD camera ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Udalski et al. 1992</ref>). Due to limited telescope access only the Galactic bulge was regularly monitored. OGLE-I phase led to the discovery of the first microlensing phenomena toward the Galactic center ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Udalski et al. 1993</ref>). Many papers were published on variable objects discovered in the Galactic bulge as well as nearby dwarf galaxies and globular clusters monitored as sub-projects of the main survey (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Udalski et al. 1994b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Kaluzny et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Kaluzny et al. 1996</ref>).</p><p>The first major instrumental upgrade of the OGLE survey occurred in 1996. Thanks to the generous attitude to the OGLE project by the Director, Dr. Leonard Searle, and astronomers of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science (owner of the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile) and OGLE's encouraging initial results, it became possible to place a new 1.3-m telescope dedicated to the OGLE project at the Las Campanas site. The Las Campanas Observatory is one of the best astronomical observing sites worldwide. First ground work for the new telescope started in August 1995. The f/9.2 Ritchey-Crétien telescope with three-lens field corrector providing 1.5 degree diameter field of view was manufactured by the DFM Engineering Inc. The "first light" of the Warsaw telescope was taken on the night of February 9/10, 1996.</p><p>The OGLE-II phase began in January 1997 and lasted up to December 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Udalski, Kubiak and Szyma´nskiSzyma´nski 1997)</ref>. The new 1.3-m Warsaw telescope was equipped with a new single chip CCD camera with a very good quality CCD detector TeX-2048. To increase monitored area of the sky the CCD detector was operated using the drift-scan technique. This mode of operation increased significantly the data throughput. With a round-the-year access to the sky new targets were added to the list of OGLE regularly monitored objects, namely the Magellanic Clouds. Generally, the OGLE survey observing capabilities increased by a factor of 30 in the amount of collected data compared to the OGLE-I phase. The number of regularly monitored stars increased from two millions to a few tens of millions.</p><p>The main scientific results of the OGLE-II phase were a further increase of the number of detected microlensing phenomena in both the Galactic center and Magellanic Clouds and selection and analysis of huge samples of variable stars of many different types. Also millions of non-variable stars were cataloged and their photometry and astrometry were released in the form of the first generation OGLE maps (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Udalski et al. 1998</ref>). These data were used for many astrophysical projects -studies of the structure of Magellanic Clouds <ref type="bibr">(Subramaniam 2004</ref>) and the Galactic center ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Rattenbury et al. 2007</ref>), studies of interstellar extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Udalski 2003a</ref>) and others.</p><p>It is worth noting here that the OGLE survey, contrary to other large-scale sky surveys, has always used filters closely resembling the standard BVI bands and, thus, the transformation of the OGLE photometry to the standard system was straightforward. Thanks to that the OGLE photometric data were always very well suited to large variety of astrophysical applications.</p><p>In the end of 1990s preparatory studies began for another major instrumental upgrade of the OGLE survey. At that time a wide field multichip CCD camera was designed. The new instrument was built, assembled and tested on the Warsaw telescope in the first half of 2001. On June 12, 2001 regular observations of the OGLE-III phase began <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Udalski 2003b</ref>). The new eight detector mosaic camera with SITe ST-002A 2048 × 4096 pixel CCDs belonged to the largest imagers worldwide at that time and the OGLE survey with regular monitoring of a few hundred million stars continued to be one of the largest sky surveys operating in the first decade of the 21st century.</p><p>New observing capabilities during the OGLE-III phase enabled a significant increase of possible scientific programs and allowed undertaking new scientific challenges. Additional important factor of the OGLE-III phase was the implementation of the Difference Image Analysis technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alard 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Alard and Lupton 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Wo´zniakWo´zniak 2000</ref> in the routine OGLE-III data pipeline. The new photometric software combined with excellent weather conditions of the Las Campanas site allowed obtaining routinely milli-magnitude (mmag) accuracy photometry, almost on the photon noise level in the wide range of magnitudes in all stellar fields regularly monitored by OGLE, including the densest in the Galactic center or Magellanic A. A.</p><p>Clouds. The OGLE photometry has commonly been appreciated as the most accurate that can be obtained from the ground and very stable over long time scales.</p><p>The most important scientific contributions of the OGLE-III phase included pioneering works in the extrasolar planet field -the discovery of first exoplanets with two new photometric techniques: transits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Udalski et al. 2002)</ref> and gravitational microlensing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bond et al. 2004</ref>), the discovery of the largest samples of variable stars (currently the OGLE collection contains about half a million of periodic objects of all types -see Soszy´nski  and references therein), studies on the Galactic center and Magellanic Cloud structure and many others.</p><p>In the second half of 2000s it became clear that while the OGLE-III survey could be in operation for several years being still competitive, its observing capabilities were highly insufficient for undertaking new generation surveys and projects. Some of them should be a natural step forward after OGLE-III discoveries but with OGLE-III capabilities they were not feasible. Therefore in 2005 an idea of a new significant upgrade of instrumental capabilities emerged ultimately leading to the new phase of the OGLE survey -OGLE-IV. It was realized that much larger CCD mosaic camera filling the entire 1.5 square diameter field of view of the Warsaw telescope combined with much faster reading of very sensitive new generation CCD detectors should allow increasing the observing capabilities by almost an order of magnitude.</p><p>Financing of this project was secured by the Polish Ministry of Science grant awarded to the OGLE team in 2006. The new instrument, built in the years 2008-2009, was equipped with 32 science grade CCDs of 2048×4102 pixel size. During the ten-months-long break after finishing OGLE-III observations <ref type="bibr">(May 4, 2009</ref>) the new camera was assembled at Las Campanas Observatory and installed on the Warsaw telescope. The first images were taken on September 7/8, 2009. After some final adjustments and fixing some encountered problems regular monitoring of the sky by the OGLE survey was resumed on the night of March 4/5, 2010. On that night the current -OGLE-IV -phase began. The final tune-up of the camera parameters was done during the major engineering run at the end of June 2010.</p><p>The OGLE-IV 262.5 Megapixel mosaic camera belongs to the largest imagers worldwide and the OGLE-IV survey with over a billion regularly monitored sources belongs to the largest photometric sky surveys. While the gravitational microlensing is still very important science driver of the fourth OGLE phase many other scientific still unexplored areas are also investigated. With years of experience in the densest stellar fields in the sky and focusing on studies of changes of brightness, OGLE-IV is currently the largest sky variability survey.</p><p>In this paper we present a detailed description of the OGLE-IV sky survey. In the following Sections the OGLE-IV camera and new associated hardware are described as well as software of the OGLE-IV survey (both for driving the camera and data pipeline). Observing strategy of the OGLE-IV project is also presented with examples of a few initial scientific results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OGLE-IV Survey Design</head><p>Switching from OGLE-III hardware to new instruments designed for the OGLE-IV phase required replacement of not only the main scientific mosaic camera but also major changes in the auxiliary hardware used at the Warsaw telescope from the beginning of its operation. In the following Subsections we describe the major components of the OGLE-IV observing set-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">OGLE-IV 32 CCD Detector Mosaic Camera</head><p>The 1.3-m Warsaw telescope is a Ritchey-Crétien optical design telescope with three lens field corrector. According to the design the field of view of the telescope with high image quality has the diameter of ≈ 1.5 degree, i.e., over 300 mm (12 in) diameter in the focal plane. In the OGLE-III phase only about 20% of this large field of view <ref type="bibr">(35 × 35 ; 125 × 125 mm; 5 × 5 in)</ref> was used with the OGLE-III mosaic camera. Thus, the natural step to increase the OGLE observing capacity was to fill the entire focal plane of the Warsaw telescope with light detectors and the idea of designing a new large field CCD mosaic camera was born. It was quickly realized that to achieve the goal the new camera would have to be by a factor of four larger than the existing eight CCD OGLE-III mosaic. Construction of such a big instrument would be very challenging and the instrument would belong to the largest imagers worldwide.</p><p>After careful investigations it was decided to build the mosaic with 2048 × 4102 pixels CCDs (CCD44-82 type) manufactured by the E2V Technologies (UK) Limited -the best available CCDs at that time <ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref>. These 15 µm pixel size detectors with very high sensitivity and enhanced red sensitivity had already been used in many astronomical applications, had extensively been tested in many observatories and had commonly been thought as the best scientific CCD detectors. It was also important that these detectors could be manufactured in large series by E2V, in relatively short time scale of several months.</p><p>The physical size of the imaging area of E2V CCD44-82-type CCD is 30.7 × 61.4 mm. To fill the focal plane of the OGLE Warsaw Telescope (≈ 300 mm diameter) we decided to use 32 detectors. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> shows the schematic of the focal plane of the OGLE-IV mosaic camera.</p><p>To maximize the focal plane filling we decided to place the CCDs in four rows with the upper two being the mirror image of the bottom two. The shape of the field covered by the mosaic is not rectangular but rather resembling a cross-like shape. The first and fourth rows consist of seven detectors while the mid ones: two and three -of nine CCDs. This design optimizes filling of the focal plane of the Warsaw telescope. It should be noted that the very corner detectors are somewhat vignetted in the farthest parts from the optical axis (about 10% of the single detector surface). However, this effect can be successfully removed through flat-fielding. The E2V CCD44-82 detectors are three side buttable so the gaps between the neighboring CCDs are at those sides very small, corresponding to several arcseconds on the sky (≈ 17 the vertical North/South gap and ≈ 26 the middle horizontal gap). However, the fourth side of the CCD has larger dead area of about 5 mm (electrical connections side) so the gaps between the row 1/2 and 3/4 are larger -of ≈ 97 on the sky. The pixel scale of the E2V CCD44-82-type CCDs in the focal plane of the Warsaw telescope is 0.26 arcsec/pixel. This scale is optimal for obtaining precise photometry in dense stellar fields and excellent seeing conditions at the Las Campanas Observatory (see Section 4). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref> presents the distribution of the E2V CCD44-82 CCDs in the camera's focal plane.</p><p>In the end of 2006 the financing of the upgrade to OGLE-IV phase was granted by the Polish Ministry of Science. In the mid 2007 the contract with the E2V company for the delivery of 32 science CCD detectors and two additional CCDs for guiding purposes was signed. All the ordered detectors were delivered by the fall of 2008.</p><p>The details of the new OGLE-IV camera were designed in 2007. The main goal was to construct a relatively compact cryogenically cooled instrument. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref> shows a general picture of the OGLE-IV camera. The main element of the camera is the vacuum vessel where all the detectors are mounted. It consists of four main components -enclosure, two lids and CCD baseplate (focal plane). All mechanical elements of the camera and new telescope instrument plate (Section 2.2) were manufactured by Zakłady Mechaniczne Kazimieruk Sp. z o.o.   N-BK7 glass <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4)</ref>. The window was coated with the multi-band antireflective layer minimizing light losses due to reflection to less than 1.5% over the wide optical wavelength range (broad band anti-reflective coating BARC-11 by ZC&amp;R Coatings for Optics, Inc.) Both lids, as well as the window are sealed with viton O-rings to secure good vacuum inside the vessel when assembled.</p><p>The main enclosure contains several ports for external devices. Four of them are designed for mounting the cryocoolers, ten for the vacuum connectors to secure the transmission of electrical signals to and from the CCDs and other electrical components, one port for the vacuum gauge (979 ATV type transducer and controller by KJ Lesker Co. Ltd) and one port for the vacuum connections -to the external vacuum pump (for external prepumping) and operating non-stop ion pump (Varian Vaclon Plus 20, StarCell) for keeping very low pressure of 10 −6 mbar during the camera operation.</p><p>The E2V CCD44-82 CCDs are packaged by the manufacturer on the 31.7 × 66.6 × 14.0 mm invar element with customary PGA connector. The package is designed to facilitate convenient and precise mounting of the detector in the instrument, close packing of the detectors for mosaic imagers and to minimize the CCD damage risk when assembling multi-detector baseplates. Detailed design of the CCD package, information on the CCD mounting plate design and instruction on the CCD package handling provided by the manufacturer make proper designing of the multi-detector mosaic instrument relatively straightforward.</p><p>The OGLE-IV camera main baseplate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5)</ref> consists of two components: two plates forming a sandwich like structure -a CCD mounting plate and a parallel cold plate. The CCD mounting plate to which the CCDs are directly attached is a 10 mm thick invar plate of 370 × 320 mm size. This plate has been precisely machined to have flat (accuracy of 5 µm) mounting surface. Additionally, at each individual CCD position a set of several holes and large rectangular opening have been drilled and milled for mounting the CCD package and to provide access to the PGA socket for CCD electrical connections. The second parallel cold plate is made of copper and plated with a thin 1 µm layer of gold for lowering thermal emissivity. The cold plate is 7 mm thick and has dimensions similar to the CCD mounting plate. Both plates are connected with 46 gold-plated copper joints. Such a design ensures uniform removal of heat over the entire baseplate. High thermal conductivity copper plate acts as a cold reservoir for the CCD mounting plate. On the other hand the invar plate has very poor thermal conductivity. However, large number of well conducting elements joining both plates makes the heat transfer to the CCD mounting plate very efficient and so the mounting plate and the CCDs reach uniform temperature in a relatively short time. Flexure of the joining elements accommodates stresses related to different thermal expansion coefficients of the copper and invar plates.</p><p>The baseplate is mounted to the camera external enclosure with eight ≈ 110 mm long posts made of 1.5 mm thick titanium plate, profiled appropriately to ensure minimum of flexure and minimal heat losses. It is cooled with four cryocoolers. Well-tested in many astronomical applications IGC Polycold Systems Inc., Cryotiger coolers with PT-30 cooling gas were selected for the OGLE-IV mosaic camera. Each cryocooler is mounted in the cylindrical housing attached to the appropriate port of the main camera enclosure. The 15-m long gas lines, two for each unit, are led through the Robotrax cable carrier system (KabelSchlepp GmbH) and the telescope structure to the separate air-conditioned room at the ground level of the telescope building where the compressor units are located. A gold plated copper container of 80 mm diameter and 12 mm depth is mounted at the cold end of each cryocooler <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>). It contains charcoal getter helping to maintain low vacuum for a long period of time. The next element of the cooling system attached to the container is a gold plated copper cold finger in the form of a bar that provides cooling to the copper plate -component of the baseplate -via a few flexible copper straps. Although the cryocoolers are basically vibration free as they do not contain moving parts, such a solution of the heat distribution ensures no mechanical vibrations of the baseplate. Each cryocooler provides at least 20 Watts of cooling. They operate at the temperature of about −150 • C at the cold finger. The number of straps connecting the cold finger and the copper plate and their thickness are adjusted in such a way that the CCD equilibrium temperature is reached at about −115 • C. It can be adjusted to higher values with the heating system mounted on the baseplate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>The electrical signals to the CCDs, temperature sensors and the internal heating system are provided via hermetic connectors (PAVE Technology Co., hermetic DB connectors with 200 pins, part drawing 2766) attached to the main enclosure at appropriate ports <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>. Each of the eight connectors for the science CCDsfour on opposites walls of the enclosure -consists of two independent units. Each unit contains two sockets connected parallelly -one internal for connecting internal elements of the electric signal distribution system and one external socket for cable connection to the external hardware. Two additional connectors (PAVE Technology Co., hermetic DB connectors with 51 pins, part drawing 3142-1) for guider CCDs are single unit devices and also contain internal and external sockets.</p><p>The internal electric signal distribution system ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>) was designed to provide appropriate signals like biases, clocking voltages and to receive video signals from each CCD detector. It consists of a series of PCB boards, 100-pin PCB mounted plugs for connecting the system to the internal sockets of the above-mentioned hermetic connectors and custom designed flex cables ending with the CCD PGA plug for the connection of signals to each of the science CCDs. Similar but much simpler system is used for single chip guider CCDs. Additional electric signals for temperature sensors of the camera and for the internal heating system are also distributed along these PCBs to the appropriate connectors. Temperature sensors and heaters distributed inside the camera are connected with thin wires to these connectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Instrument Plate</head><p>The instrument plate is a 18 mm thick aluminum plate mounted 224 mm from the bottom of the telescope mirror cell with 17 aluminum and additional four titanium posts. Such a design ensures stiffness of the construction and minimizes flexure. The central part of the instrument plate contains the mosaic camera mounting port. The camera is mounted to the bottom (external plane) of the instrument plate. The room between the mirror cell and the instrument plate is used for mounting auxiliary devices necessary for the science operation of the OGLE-IV camera. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref> for general picture of this element of the OGLE-IV observing system.</p><p>The large format mechanical shutter providing 300 × 340 mm opening over the camera window is bolted to the internal bottom plane of the instrumental plate. The shutter was designed and manufactured at the Argelander Institute for Astronomy of the Bonn University, Germany (http://www.bonn-shutter.de) and this is the OGLE suited version of well-tested large field shutters manufactured for many photometric surveys. The design of the shutter ensures uniform exposures, free from the shutter error, for exposures time as short as a tenth of second. The shutter controller is also mounted to the instrument plate, however, on its external side.</p><p>The next important system mounted to the instrumental plate is the filter holder. It consists of the moving filter-holding plate and supporting hardware. Due to limited space below the telescope mirror cell only two large size filters fitting the field of view of the Warsaw telescope are supported. The filter set consists of a main filter and two additional smaller filters for the guider CCDs. V and I-band interference filters (Section 2.3) are permanently mounted in the filter holder.</p><p>The filter holder can be moved over the shutter and it is supported by two linear guideways (HIWIN HG Series) and precisely positioned with a ball screw driven by a computer controlled stepper motor and a set of position sensors.</p><p>Side walls made from 1 mm thick aluminum black painted sheet close and seal the room between the instrument plate and mirror cell protecting the internal parts from dust and other type contamination. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 8</ref> showing the entire system on the  Vol. 65</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>Warsaw telescope. Two CCD controllers of the OGLE-IV camera Data Acquisition System are also mounted to the instrumental plate -next to the OGLE-IV camera. Additional device mounted to the instrumental plate is the ion pump, operating permanently and ensuring very low pressure of 10 −6 mbar inside the camera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Filters</head><p>The V-and I-band interference filter sets for the OGLE-IV camera were designed and manufactured by Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd. The substrate on which the interference layers were coated is a 12 mm thick quartz plate. The main component of the filter set is the science detector filter. Its size is 310 × 310 mm. The set also contains two additional small filters of 70 × 35 mm size with the same parameters -for guider CCDs. They are mounted on the sides of the same socket of the filter holder as the main science filter. Gray dots mark QE curve from the manufacturer's specification; blue band shows the typical QE as measured for the actually installed CCDs; green and red curves present the laboratory-measured filter transmission curves for V-and I-band filters, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data Acquisition System</head><p>The electronic signals of all CCDs of the OGLE-IV mosaic camera are fed to the CCD module of the OGLE-IV Data Acquisition System. It is based on the Robert Leach's Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc., ARC IV generation CCD controller system. Two identical controllers are used in the OGLE-IV camera, each driving 16 CCD detectors: Northern (red marked CCDs in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>): -CCDs #01 -#16 and Southern (blue marked CCDs in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>): CCDs #17 -#32.</p><p>Each controller consists of two eight-channel CCD video boards (ARC-48) for processing the CCD signals and providing readout biases, six CCD clock driver boards (ARC-32) providing CCD clocking voltages, one timing board (ARC-22) generating CCD clocking signals, controlling the system and data transfer over the fiber optic link and one utility board (ARC-50) for additional controlling functions. All these boards are plugged to the main data bus board providing all the necessary inter-board connections. All boards are mounted in the 12-slot ARC system enclosure attached to the instrument plate. The power supplies for the controllers are placed in the telescope pedestal. Eight meter power supply cables going through the telescope structure and Robotrax cable carriers provide all the necessary DC voltages to the controllers.</p><p>The science CCDs work with the gain of approximately 1.7 e − /ADU and the typical readout noise (RN) is from 4 to 11 e − depending on the detector. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for details. The analog/digital converters of the video chain work in the 16-bit mode, i.e., ensure 65536 light levels. The reading time of the entire array is about 18 sec.</p><p>The controllers are connected via 50-m long fiber optic cables with PCI Interface boards (ARC-64) interfacing the ARC system with a dedicated mosaic camera PC computer located in the server room of the telescope control building.</p><p>The Data Acquisition System CCD software consists of a few separate modules. Low level assembler software for clocking and reading the OGLE-IV E2V CCD44-82 CCD detectors and controlling the ARC system is based on the software samples and software libraries provided with the ARC controller. It is loaded to the ARC controller when the system is restarted.</p><p>The mosaic camera data acquisition program is run on the mosaic camera PC computer. It starts and stops exposures, reads the mosaic CCDs and performs many other tasks necessary for smooth operation of the CCD array. This program can listen to commands either locally or, as during regular operation, from external computer. During regular operation the collected image from the OGLE-IV camera is immediately transferred by this PC to the OGLE-IV raw images storage server via a super-fast 10 Gb Ethernet data network <ref type="figure">(LAN-CN)</ref>. This transfer takes about 1.7 sec. for a full 0.5 GByte frame what with the pixel reading time of 18 sec makes the total reading time of the mosaic equal to about 20 sec.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>Two guider CCDs are driven by independent guider module of the Data Acquisition System. It is based on a significantly refurbished guiding system used during the past phases of the OGLE survey. The guider CCDs signal board and video processing board are somewhat modified versions of boards used for OGLE-III mosaic camera. They are controlled by a DSP-based controller board. This microcontroller is located at the telescope in the so called "red box" mounted to the instrument plate. It controls not only the guider CCDs but also the OGLE-IV camera filter movements and positioning. The OGLE-IV guider CCDs are frame-transfer mode versions of the E2V CCD44-82 CCD detectors. Storage area of the guider detector is blocked out against incoming light by a mechanical mask mounted to the invar plate. Thus, the guider CCDs do not need additional shutters. However, they see the sky only during the exposure of the OGLE-IV mosaic, when the main shutter is open.</p><p>General control of the entire guiding system (collection of guiding images, corrections of the telescope tracking) as well as the control of the filter (FLT) positioning and the dry nitrogen (N 2 ) anti-frost system is done by the guider PC computer. Commands and data exchange with the "red box" controller at the telescope is done via a PCI controller -a simplified version of the OGLE-III mosaic camera PCI controller. Guider PC software can operate locally or, as during regular operation, it can receive commands over the network from an external computer.</p><p>The anti-frost system of the OGLE-IV mosaic camera consists of a compressed nitrogen cylinder located at the ground level of the telescope dome, a set of pressure reductors, computer controlled valve and teflon tube hose to the top lid of the camera. A small, 4 mm diameter, horizontal channel drilled in the lid, ending over the window on one side and with the hose fitting on another, enables the dry nitrogen flow directly over the camera window. When the external humidity rises over 50% the valve is opened by the guider PC enabling slow flow of the dry nitrogen over the camera's glass window. This prevents forming dew or frost on the large window of the camera due to thermal emission when the camera has been cooled down.</p><p>The main Data Acquisition System computer controlling the entire process of data taking, OGLE, is located in the server room of the telescope control buildingabout 15 meters out of the telescope dome. This is a 2-CPUs (eight cores) SuperMicro Computers, Inc., storage server with a 24 TBytes RAID. It communicates over 1 Gb Ethernet computer network (LAN-TEL) with the remaining Data Acquisition System computers, namely guider PC and telescope PC. The latter computer controls operation of the 1.3-m Warsaw telescope. It was delivered by manufacturer with the appropriate Microsoft Windows based software. OGLE is also connected over the super-fast 10 Gb Ethernet data link (LAN-CN) with the mosaic camera PC and the computers of the Data Analysis System. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 10</ref>   The main Data Acquisition System software, TCS, is run on OGLE. This program is a graphical user interface operating under LINUX X-windows software, using the xForms toolkit. Parallelly, it is also a center of control -a server exchanging appropriate commands with other PC computers of the system. TCS consists of three main modules allowing user friendly, manual operation of the telescope, mosaic camera and guider as well as of several additional utilities for effectively conducting observations (image display, weather control, etc). TCS program can also operate in the batch mode. In this mode commands to the telescope, camera or guider can be uploaded to the TCS program in the form of external scripts. This allows automatic operation of the entire system. The batch mode is the main mode used during regular OGLE-IV observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>In the past, the TCS program windows were displayed on the remote OGLE monitors located in the main control room of the telescope control building where observers conduct observations. Those monitors were connected to the OGLE computer with a dedicated link and video signal extending hardware. However, this solution has been replaced with a dedicated Dell PC workstation with two large monitors running Linux X-windows server. This workstation serves currently as the basic user interface to the OGLE-IV Data Acquisition System and the TCS windows from the OGLE computer are displayed on its screens via the X-windows protocol.</p><p>The OGLE computer RAID disk serves simultaneously as a storage area for raw images coming from the mosaic camera PC computer. In spite of a huge data flow of collected science images (100-200 GB uncompressed data per night) OGLE's RAID capacity is large enough to keep the collected frames for several months. For data backup and transportation of the images to the headquarters in Warsaw, the Ultrium LTO-5 tape drive (1.5/3 TB capacity of a tape) is interfaced to the OGLE computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">OGLE-IV Data Analysis System</head><p>The huge number of frames collected during regular observations by the OGLE-IV survey makes it crucial to process and analyze images in near-real time to avoid saturation with Terabytes of data and long lags with obtaining scientific results. The OGLE-IV Data Analysis System was designed to process the images on-site, during the night and early morning hours.</p><p>OGLE-IV Data Analysis System contains a few components described below. Three data pipelines are a real time software allowing image preprocessing, main photometric reductions of collected images and fast, almost on-the-fly photometry of selected objects. The remaining packages are run typically when the night is over and all reductions are done. They are designed for the detection of gravitational microlensing events and other types of transient objects (mostly supernovae, SNe) or tracing photometric behavior of particular variable objects.</p><p>These systems operate on instrumental OGLE-IV photometry coming from the on-line reduction pipeline which has only been crudely calibrated to the standard system (accuracy of the photometry zero points is about ±0.15 mag). For scientific application the OGLE-IV photometry has to be calibrated to the standard VI system. Also astrometry of all detected objects has to be derived.</p><p>Hardware of the OGLE-IV Data Analysis System <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 10)</ref> consists of several high performance computers. A 2-CPUs (eight cores) SuperMicro Computers, Inc., storage server computer with 24 TBytes RAID, ULENS, (identical to the OGLE computer of the Data Acquisition System) has been used mainly for the image preprocessing pipeline and storage server of prereduced images. Another Ultrium LTO-5 tape drive is connected to ULENS for data backup. Additionally, the selected object photometry pipeline has been implemented and run on this computer.</p><p>In the years 2010-2014, the OGLE-IV main photometry pipeline used three computing units from SuperMicro Computer, Inc. Every unit contained two independent computers with two four-core CPUs each. Altogether 48 CPU cores were available for running photometric reduction processes. These computing capabilities ensured OGLE-IV data reductions within the 2-16 hour time frame after the end of a night, depending on the season of year. All computers of the Data Analysis System have been networked with the super-fast 10 Gb Ethernet data network <ref type="figure">(LAN-CN)</ref>.</p><p>In 2015 observing season these "first generation" computers have been replaced by newer generation units: the ULENS computer is now a SuperMicro dual CPU, 20 cores, 96 TB RAID storage server and the main photometric pipeline is realized with a SuperMicro SuperBlade server. The latter computer contains 260 CPU cores, significantly faster than the previous CPUs and additionally 9 TB of storage area. With these computing capabilities the OGLE-IV main photometric pipeline is now indeed able to operate practically in real time mode -with the photometric reductions finished within a few minutes after a collected frame has been preprocessed. Extended disk storage area of the OGLE-IV Data Analysis System ensures capacities large enough for stable work over a period of years.</p><p>The science images collected by the Data Acquisition System are stored on the OGLE computer as raw images. The photometric prereductions pipeline converts them into debiased and flat-fielded FITS format images, ready for photometric reductions and stores them on the ULENS storage server of the Data Analysis System.</p><p>The size of each full field OGLE-IV image containing all mosaic CCDs is over 0.5 GB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref> presents the reference image of the one of the most dense stellar fields on the sky observed regularly by the OGLE-IV survey -BLG505 in the Galactic bulge. It contains over six million detected stars.</p><p>To make the data handling easier, images from each CCD of the mosaic camera (hereafter sub-fields) are stored as independent FITS files with appropriate extensions in the file name: 01 -32 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> for correspondence of the numbers with appropriate CCD detectors). These sub-components of the full image are then processed independently by the OGLE-IV data reduction pipelines.</p><p>Every clear night a set of calibrating images: biases and sky flat-field images are taken and new sets of master images (Zero and Flat <ref type="bibr">[IV]</ref>) for each individual mosaic chip are obtained. These calibration images are then used for de-biasing and flat-fielding of science images collected during a night. It is worth stressing here the extremely high stability of the OGLE-IV observing system over long periods of time. Comparison of flat-field images taken on time scales of weeks shows negligible variations, usually smaller than a few mmags. Therefore preparation of new calibration images every night is not crucial for keeping the high precision of the OGLE photometry.</p><p>The preprocessing pipeline is based on the well-tested pipeline used during the previous phases of the OGLE survey. The main modification included implementa- tion of the cross-talk minimalization routines that remove practically to zero level artifacts resulting from the cross-talk noise generated in the multichannel video board when a bright saturated star has been read in one of the video channels (on one of the CCDs).</p><p>Additional very important feature implemented for the OGLE-IV prereduction pipeline is the possibility of its parallel execution what significantly shortened the lag between image acquisition and preprocessing. During the Galactic bulge season when the OGLE data flow is the highest, up to six pipelines are run simultaneously ensuring practically immediate (within 5-10 minutes) preprocessing of the collected images. The reference images for each CCD from the OGLE-IV mosaic have the size of 2200 × 4496 pixels. The first of the components of the reference image (best resolution and photometric quality images), which natural size is 2048 × 4102 pixels, is centered in this grid. It defines the photometric zero point of the reference image and the astrometric grid. The same first components are used to all sub-fields for a given field, thus the same (first) image defines the basic parameters of the reference image of a given field. Subsequent components of the reference images which are somewhat shifted compared to the first component fill gradually the area of the OGLE-IV reference image. The size of the OGLE-IV reference image is large enough to fill the gaps between the CCD detectors of the OGLE-IV mosaic camera, including two large horizontal gaps.</p><p>The photometric reductions of each individual sub-field (individual CCD) of the OGLE-IV field are performed on subframes to minimize the variation of the PSF along the field (which, actually, is small) and to simplify the data handling in dense stellar fields. The photometric reductions of individual images are done on the grid of 4 × 8, 2 × 4 and 1 × 2 subframes in the densest, moderately dense and relatively empty stellar fields observed by the OGLE-IV survey, respectively. Each subframe is reduced independently by the DIA photometry software using standard procedures <ref type="bibr">(cf. Wo´zniakWo´zniak 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Udalski 2003b</ref>) and the appropriate subframe of the reference image. When reductions of all subframes are done, the photometry of each of them is merged into final result files for a given image. They contain photometry of all stellar objects detected on the reference image, photometry of "new" objects (undetected as stellar on the reference image) and information about the stellar objects from the reference image detected on the subtracted image. The OGLE-IV real time systems are based on the latter two files.</p><p>The OGLE-IV photometry is stored in the standard OGLE databases <ref type="bibr">(Szy- ma´nskima´nski and</ref><ref type="bibr">Udalski 1993, Udalski 2003b</ref>). They are constructed for each sub-field (corresponding to a single CCD detector of the OGLE-IV camera) of a given field and each pass-band. The databases are updated after each observing night when the reductions of the collected images are finished. Before the update, poor quality images that sometimes accidentally enter into the reduction pipeline are filtered out to minimize contamination of databases by poor quality data.</p><p>There are two kinds of databases for each sub-field. The main database contains photometry of all stellar objects detected on the reference image. The zero point of this photometry is roughly calibrated with the accuracy of about 0.15 mag. The photometry from the main databases is further referred to as OGLE instrumental photometry. The auxiliary database contains photometry of "new" objects detected on the subtracted images. Because the reference flux of these objects is undefined, only the excess flux measured on the difference image of the current image is stored in this type of databases.</p><p>There are many astrophysical situations where information on the current photometric behavior of interesting objects is crucial for their optimal photometric A. A.</p><p>coverage. During the years 2010-2014 the delays of the OGLE standard reduction pipeline were in many cases unacceptably long. Therefore the independent photometric pipeline was implemented. Its primary aim was fast determination of photometry of interesting objects selected for fast monitoring. These are typically promising microlensing events, SNe or other transients. Technically, the reductions were conducted in the identical way as in the main OGLE pipeline, using standard OGLE reference images but just on the subframes containing these objects. The photometry was available and ready for inspection to the observer and Warsaw headquarters within a few minutes after pre-reductions of a new image were finished. Since 2015, the new SuperBlade data reduction server has been ensuring the real time and lag-free photometry of the entire frame. Therefore, the pipeline dedicated to these interesting transient objects has been modified to avoid doubling of the reductions.</p><p>Roughly calibrated OGLE instrumental databases are used directly for all variability studies of the OGLE targets. However, the final results require calibration to the standard VI photometric system. Photometric calibrations have been done in a few steps. First, the color term coefficients of all CCD detectors of the OGLE-IV mosaic camera have been derived based on observations of thousands non-variable stars with large spread in color -secondary photometric standards from the OGLE-III photometric maps ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Udalski et al. 2008b</ref>). As already mentioned in Section 2.3, the color term coefficients: ε V and ε I , for the V and I-bands, respectively, for all OGLE-IV camera CCDs are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The I-band filter used in OGLE-IV resembles very closely the standard I-band and the color terms of individual detectors are very small. The difference between the OGLE-IV V-band filter and the standard one is larger, nevertheless the color term coefficients are still acceptable in this case and ensure precise calibration to the standard system. On the other hand the throughput of both OGLE-IV interference filters is much larger than the throughput of the standard glass filters.</p><p>In the second step for each night considered to be photometric the zero points of the standard VI photometry were derived based on observations of the OGLE-IV calibrating fields, namely fields fully overlapping with OGLE-III photometric maps containing thousands of secondary photometric standards. For each subframe of the sub-field (the entity on which the basic DIA photometric reductions are performed) the average aperture correction was derived allowing conversion of the OGLE DIA instrumental photometry to the absolute signal scale. Then the comparison of the standard OGLE-III maps photometry with the latter, after correcting for the color term of individual standard stars, yielded the measurement of the photometric zero point of a given night. Averaging several (V-band) to hundreds (I-band) such measurements provided the mean photometric zero points for a given night. Scatter of these measurements turned out to be an useful indicator of the photometric stability of a night. The nights with large scatter exceeding 0.05 mag were assumed to be non-photometric.</p><p>Finally, all the OGLE-IV fields observed during a photometric night were calibrated to the standard VI system based on the zero point of the standard photometry derived in the previous step. For each subframe of a sub-field of a given OGLE-IV frame the aperture correction was derived between the instrumental (OGLE-IV database) photometry and the absolute signal scale. Then, the difference between the aperture correction and the zero point of the standard photometry of a given night provided, after small correction for atmospheric extinction, the measurement of the average shift between the instrumental OGLE-IV database zero point (rough calibration assumed during the database initialization) and the standard photometric scale.</p><p>Final shift of the zero points between instrumental (OGLE-IV database) and calibrated photometry is the average of many such measurements obtained during tens/hundreds of photometric nights after removing 0.05 mag and higher outliers. The calibration of the instrumental OGLE-IV databases to the standard system is given by the following set of equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(V − I) = µ · [(v DB + ∆ZP V ) − (i DB + ∆ZP I )] I = (i DB + ∆ZP I ) + ε I · (V − I)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">V = (v DB + ∆ZP V ) + ε V · (V − I)</formula><p>where ∆ZP V and ∆ZP I denote the shift between the OGLE-IV instrumental and the standard photometric scale zero points and µ = (1 − ε V + ε I ) −1 . Astrometry of the OGLE-IV fields has been derived in similar way as during the OGLE-III phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Udalski et al. 2008a</ref>). For each of the sub-fields (individual CCD detectors) of the OGLE-IV targets the bright stars from the OGLE-IV databases were matched with the list of stars from the 2MASS Point Source Catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) and then the third degree polynomial transformations between the image (X,Y ) pixel grid and RA/DEC of the 2MASS coordinate system were derived. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> shows the residuals of transformation for transformation stars. (X,Y ) coordinate system corresponds to E-W and S-N directions in the sky. Top panels present residuals for the most dense Galactic bulge field BLG505 and typical field of somewhat lower stellar density -BLG510. The lower panels show residuals of transformation for the typical dense stellar field in the Magellanic System (LMC503) and typical field of very low stellar density there (MBR103).</p><p>Generally, the accuracy of astrometric transformations is from about 0. 1 to 0. 3 in empty fields -checked additionally on the overlapping parts of OGLE-IV images.

It has been providing information on the on-going gravitational microlensing events and has been the base of the microlensing science field for 20 years, enabling, for example, formation of several microlensing follow-up groups like PLANET ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cassan et al. 2012</ref>), µFUN ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gould et al. 2010</ref>) and other. During the following OGLE phases the EWS system was re-implemented, increasing significantly the rate of microlensing detections with enhanced observing capabilities of the OGLE survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Udalski 2003b</ref>).</p><p>Implementation of the EWS for the OGLE-IV survey was one of the high priority tasks after starting the OGLE-IV phase. The first observing season (2010) was devoted to collecting good quality images, hence enabling real time reductions of the OGLE-IV targets. Starting from 2011, the OGLE-IV EWS system was back in operation. The number of the Galactic bulge fields -the main targets for microlensing research -covered by the EWS increased gradually from the most microlensing-efficient central Galactic bulge ones in 2011 to all regularly observed Galactic center microlensing fields in 2013 (100 fields in 2013, reduced to 85 from 2014 on). The number of microlensing detections reached the rate of about 2000 per year -the increase by a factor of three compared to the OGLE-III phase.</p><p>Two other real time systems implemented during the OGLE-III phase -XROM and RCOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Udalski 2008</ref>) have also been reimplemented for OGLE-IV. These systems provide real time photometric monitoring of the optical counterparts of Xray sources (XROM) and R Coronae Borealis stars (RCOM). Photometric behavior of these stars is unpredictable. OGLE-IV XROM and RCOM systems provide astronomical community with a unique possibility of tracing current photometric behavior of these very interesting variable stars. The OGLE survey also continues regular monitoring of the Einstein Cross gravitational lens (Huchra's lens). OGLE unique coverage and precise photometry of its all four images extend now for over 17 years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Udalski et al. 2006</ref>). OGLE-IV real time data system for the Einstein Cross will be reimplemented in the next months.</p><p>In 2012 a new OGLE-IV real time system was implemented -OGLE-IV Transient Detection System (OTDS, <ref type="bibr">Kozłowski et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Wyrzykowski et al. 2014</ref>). Large area of the sky of about 650 square degrees around the Magellanic System (the Magellanic Clouds and Bridge) regularly monitored by the OGLE-IV survey provides excellent observational data for the search for supernovae (SNe) or other type transient objects like, for example, novae or dwarf novae. The SN detection rate of the OGLE-IV survey reaches 200 objects per year placing the OGLE-IV SN survey among the most efficient surveys of this kind worldwide. It is worth noting that the OGLE-IV SN survey is limited to the Magellanic System visibility period from Las Campanas. Thus, it is typically active for about eight months per year.</p></div>

The distribution of seeing is clearly non-symmetric with a sharp cutoff at 0. 95 resulting from the dome seeing, telescope classical optics and a requirement of optimal focusing of the entire CCD mosaic.

A customary software based on the image subtraction technique, routinely used by the OGLE survey for data reduction, was written for the detection of moving objects. The OCKS was conducted for one season <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref>. About 5100 images in 1550 pointings were collected during this project. Altogether 14 new large Kuiper Belt objects were detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Sheppard et al. 2011</ref>). One of the best candidates, 2010 EK139 has been followed up by the Herschel satellite for albedo determination what allowed the determination of its size -equal to 470 km ( <ref type="bibr">Pál et al. 2012</ref>). 2010 EK139, being a scattered disk object, is one of the best candidates for a dwarf planet.</p><p>Another type of short-time surveys conducted from time to time by OGLE are observations of large areas of the sky for the detection of stellar streams, etc.  A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Long-Term Large-Scale Sky Surveys</head><p>Long-term OGLE-IV surveys constitute a category of surveys lasting for extended amount of time, several observing seasons. The main scientific aim of these surveys is to provide the sky variability information in the selected OGLE-IV linesof-sight. However, very precise OGLE photometry can be simultaneously used for mapping non-variable objects for many scientific projects related, for example with the structure studies of observed targets, etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Galactic Bulge</head><p>The main OGLE-IV long-term surveys conducted from the beginning of the OGLE-IV phase include the second generation microlensing survey of the Galactic bulge. It monitors regularly over 130 square degrees in the Galactic center -see the sky map in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 15</ref>. The Galactic bulge fields are observed with different cadence which is color-coded in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 15</ref>. It depends on the frequency of microlensing events observed in these fields. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 16</ref> shows the histogram of the difference of epochs between consecutive observations for typical fields of different categories based on observations collected in the years 2010-2014. Histograms of every category are color-coded as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 15</ref> and normalized to the highest peak.  The first two categories of fields (red and yellow in Figs. 15 and 16) cover 4.5 and 8.5 square degrees in the sky and are observed with the cadence of 19 and 60 minutes (their main peaks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 16</ref>), respectively. Lower peaks in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 16</ref> correspond to the typical frequency of observations during early (February-March) and late (September-October) parts of the observing season. These are the main fields of the second generation microlensing survey focused on the detection of a large number of gravitational microlensing events for studying exoplanets. The microlensing technique of exoplanet detection proved to be very important tool for exoplanet studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Poleski et al. 2014ab, Gould et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Skowron et al. 2015</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A.</head><p>The fields of the remaining categories are monitored with lower cadence, typically: green fields 1-3 times per night, blue -once per night, cyan once per two nights (during the main part of the observing season).</p><p>The total number of stars monitored during the second generation microlensing survey exceeds 400 million. Typical number of collected science images of the Galactic bulge for this survey reaches about 23 thousand per year (≈ 12.5 TBytes/season). The total number of collected epochs in the I-band during the seasons 2010-2014 varies from about 10 700 to 200 per field for the highest (red) and lowest (cyan) cadence fields, respectively. The fields centered on the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy (BLG705-BLG711) were observed over 150 times and the highly obscured fields at the Galactic plane about 65-100 times. Additionally 3670 V-band images were collected (6-128 per field). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 17</ref> shows the accuracy of the I-band photometry and completeness of the survey in one of the highest stellar density fields -BLG505 and typical Galactic bulge field of lower density -BLG510. The OGLE-IV photometry covers the range of 12 &lt; I &lt; 20.5 mag and 12 &lt; I &lt; 21 mag in the BLG505 and BLG510 fields, respectively. However, due to high stellar crowding it is complete to I ≈ 18.5 mag and I ≈ 19 mag in these fields.</p><p>Beside studies of exoplanets with microlensing, the photometric data of the second generation microlensing survey are ideal observational material for investigating all variety of variables in the Galactic bulge (e.g., RR Lyr stars, Soszy´nski <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Pietrukowicz et al. 2015</ref>). Data for non-variable stars are perfect tool for studying, for example, the Galactic structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Nataf et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Nataf et al. , 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Magellanic System</head><p>The second main long-term OGLE-IV survey conducted mostly during complementary part of the year is the monitoring of about 650 square degrees of the Magellanic System. This huge survey provides variability data for the Magellanic Cloud objects, as well as for the Magellanic Bridge <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 18)</ref>. Non-variable objects detected during this survey for the first time allowed the precise mapping of the stellar populations in the Magellanic Bridge ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Skowron et al. 2014</ref>). The Magellanic System survey also provides data for the OGLE-IV extragalactic projects -OGLE-IV SN survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Wyrzykowski et al. 2014</ref>) or The Magellanic Quasars Survey ( <ref type="bibr">Kozłowski et al. 2013</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 19</ref> shows the distribution of time difference between consecutive epochs of the selected OGLE-IV fields in the Magellanic System fields based on observations collected in the years 2010-2014. This plot -similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 16</ref> for the Galactic bulge -indicates that the typical cadence of the central fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds was about 1-3 days and 2-3 days for the main Magellanic Bridge fields. Halo fields of both Clouds (not shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 19)</ref> were observed with a somewhat lower cadence of 3-5 days. The total number of monitored stars in the Magellanic System exceeds 80 million (62, 13, 6 million in the LMC, SMC and MBR, respectively). Typically 23 thousand science images of these fields are collected every observing season (lasting approximately from June to May next year). This is ≈ 12.5 TBytes of raw data per season. The total number of I-band observations (for variability studies) per field collected during the seasons <ref type="bibr">2010/2011-2013/2014</ref> varies from 300-700, 300-500 and 270-310 epochs in the central fields of the LMC, SMC and main part of MBR, respectively, For the halo fields the number of collected observations was in the range of 82-150 epochs per field. In the V-band the number of collected science images was about 8700: 10-230 per field in the main parts of the Magellanic Clouds and Bridge and 3-10 in the halo fields.</p><p>OGLE-IV I-band photometry covers the range of about 13 &lt; I &lt; 21.7 mag in the Magellanic System fields. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 20</ref> presents the accuracy of photometry and its completeness in the central LMC field of high stellar density, LMC503, and typical empty field in the Magellanic Bridge -MBR103. Full completeness of photometry reaches I ≈ 20.5 mag in the very dense stellar fields like LMC503 and I ≈ 21.2 mag in the empty fields like MBR103. Obviously, this is a result of stellar crowding and higher background in the former fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OGLE Galaxy Variability Survey</head><p>In 2013 another long-term sky variability survey was started by OGLE-IV. This is the largest ever, long-term photometric survey of the Galaxy -OGLE Galaxy  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 20</ref>. Accuracy of the OGLE-IV I-band photometry of the typical Magellanic System fields: high stellar density field LMC503 from the center of the LMC and very empty Magellanic Bridge field MBR103. Only 33% stars from the LMC503 field were plotted, for clarity. Insets show completeness of photometry -histograms of stellar counts as a function of magnitude. MC red clump giants are responsible for the excess of stars at 18.0 &lt; I &lt; 18.5 mag.</p><p>Variability Survey. By regular monitoring (1-2 days cadence for the first ≈ 100 epochs and lower after that) of over 2000 square degrees -around the Galactic plane and extended area around the outer Galactic bulge -this survey will provide unique variability census of the Milky Way as seen from Las Campanas Observatory (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figs. 15 and 21</ref>), up to I ≈ 18.5 mag. These data will be extremely valuable for studying the Galaxy structure and variable objects properties. A complementary, much deeper survey started yet in 2010 will map all stellar objects from these lines-of-sight to I ≈ 22 mag. In the observing seasons 2010-2014 about 56 600 images in the I-band and 4400 V-band frames were collected by OGLE-IV survey for this project (34 TBytes of raw data). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Prospects</head><p>OGLE-IV survey has been successfully run for the last five years. After the initial phase of the implementation of hardware and basic software, implementation of real time reductions and real time systems, the OGLE-IV survey reached its expected performance and entered the phase of regular observing and real time data reductions. Tens of scientific projects has already been completed and their results published.</p><p>Information on the current status of the OGLE project and its discoveries can be obtained at:</p><p>http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl This is also a starting point for data-mining of the huge OGLE Internet Archive.</p><p>During the next years the OGLE-IV survey will continue monitoring of the most interesting regions of the sky focusing on the densest stellar areas, usually omitted by other wide-field sky surveys. OGLE-IV will provide new collections of variable objects and photometric databases which will be a gold mine for hundreds of new scientific projects for years to come.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
