				<p>Context. The first detection of a moon around an extrasolar planet (an &quot;exomoon&quot;) might be feasible with NASA&apos;s Kepler or ESA&apos;s upcoming PLATO space telescopes or with the future ground-based European Extremely Large Telescope. To guide observers and to use observational resources most efficiently, we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can form. Aims. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of water (H 2 O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets. We want to know how the different heating sources in those disks affect the location of the H 2 O ice lines as a function of stellar and planetary distance. Methods. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic equilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our semi-analytical framework-(1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3) accretional heating of the disk, and (4) stellar illumination-are fed by precomputed planet evolution models. We consider accreting planets with final masses between 1 and 12 Jupiter masses at distances between 1 and 20 AU to a solar type star. Results. Accretion disks around Jupiter-mass planets closer than about 4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H 2 O ice lines, whereas the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close as 3 AU to Sun-like stars. We derive an empirical formula for the total moon mass as a function of planetary mass and stellar distance and predict that super-Jovian planets forming beyond about 5 AU can host Mars-mass moons. Planetary illumination is the major heat source in the final stages of accretion around Jupiter-mass planets, whereas disks around the most massive super-Jovians are similarly heated by planetary illumination and viscous heating. This indicates a transition towards circumstellar accretion disks, where viscous heating dominates in the stellar vicinity. We also study a broad range of circumplanetary disk parameters for planets at 5.2 AU and find that the H 2 O ice lines are universally between about 15 and 30 Jupiter radii in the final stages of accretion when the last generation of moons is supposed to form. Conclusions. If the abundant population of super-Jovian planets around 1 AU formed in situ, then these planets should lack the previously predicted population of giant icy moons, because those planets&apos; disks did not host H 2 O ice in the final stages of accretion. But in the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current locations from beyond about 3 to 4.5 AU they might be orbited by large, water-rich moons. In this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable zones. Future exomoon detections and non-detections can provide powerful constraints on the formation and migration history of giant exoplanets.</p>

Moon formation theories can guide observers and data analysts in their searches to streamline efforts.

The H 2 O ice line is critical for the formation of large, possibly detectable moons, because here the surface density of solids increases sharply by a factor of 3 to 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hayashi 1981)</ref>.

The inner moons Io and Europa turned out mostly rocky and comparatively light, whereas Ganymede and Callisto formed extremely rich in water ices (about 50 %) but became substantially more massive <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Showman &amp; Malhotra 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Our main findings were that (1) super-Jovian planets at 5.2 AU around Sun-like stars have their H 2 O ice lines between about 15 and 30 Jupiter radii (R Jup ) during the late stages of accretion, when the final generation of moons form. This range is almost independent of the planetary mass (M p ). (2) With the most massive planets having the most widely extended disks, these disks host the largest reservoirs of H 2 O ices. In particular, the total instantaneous mass of solids (M sld ) in these disks scales roughly proportional with M p . <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The current orbital position of Ganymede is very close the mean radial location of the circumjovian H 2 O ice line in our simulations, suggesting a novel picture in which Ganymede formed at a circumplanetary ice line trap. (4) Heat transitions, however, transverse the accretion disks on a very short timescale (≈ 10 4 yr) once the planet opens up a gap in the circumstellar accretion disk and thereby drastically reduces the supply of material. This timescale is short compared to the satellite migration time scale (10 5 -10 7 yr) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tanaka et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sasaki et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ogihara &amp; Ida 2012)</ref> and the time that is left for the final accretion until shutdown (10 5 yr). Hence, heat transitions around super-Jovian planets cannot act as moons traps, which indicates a different behavior of planet and moon formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Menou &amp; Goodman 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kretke &amp; Lin 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We here extend the parameter space of our previous paper and consider planetary accretion between 1 and 20 AU from the star. This range is motivated by two facts. First, super-Jovians are the most abundant type of confirmed planets, that is, objects with accurate mass estimates at these distances (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr">2</ref> . And second, this range contains the stellar habitable zone around Sunlike stars, which is of particular interest given the fact that giant, water-rich moons might be frequent habitable environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heller &amp; Armstrong 2014;</ref>). Our main goal is to locate the H 2 O ice lines in the circumplanetary accretion disks at the time of moon formation shutdown. Their radial separations from the planet will correspond to the orbital radii at or beyond which we can suspect the most massive, water-rich moons to reside. In particular, stellar illumination at only a few AU from the star will prevent the accretion disks from having H 2 O ice lines and therefore from hosting large moons. We determine these critical stellar distances below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>We use the framework developed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014)</ref>, which models a 2D axisymmetric accretion disk in hydrostatic equilibrium around the planet. It considers four heating terms, or energy fluxes, of the disk, namely (1) viscous heating (F vis ), (2) planetary illumination (F p ), (3) accretional heating of the disk (F acc ), and (4) stellar illumination, all of which determine the midplane and surface temperature of the disk as a function of planetary distance (r). This model (based on earlier work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, 2014</ref> considers F vis as a distributed energy source within the disk, while F p , F acc , and stellar illumination are considered external heat sources. The model . Symbols indicate the discovery method of each planet, six solar system planets are shown for comparison. Note the cluster of red dots around 1 AU along the abscissa and between 1 and 10 M Jup along the ordinate. These super-Jovian planets might be hosts of Mars-mass moons. The shaded region denotes the solar habitable zone defined by the runaway and maximum greenhouse as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kopparapu et al. (2013).</ref> also includes an analytical treatment for the vertical radiative energy transfer, which depends on the Planck mean opacity (κ P ). In real disks, κ P will depend on the disk temperature and the composition of the solids. In particular, it will be a function of the radial distance to the planet and it will evolve in time as small particles stick together and coagulate. To reduce computational demands, we here assume a constant κ P throughout the disk, but we will test values over two orders of magnitude to explore the effects of changing opacities. The vertical gas density in the disk is approximated with an isothermal profile, which is appropriate because we are mostly interested in the very final stages of accretion when the disk midplane and the disk surface have similar temperatures. Furthermore, deviations between an isothermal and an adiabatic vertical treatment are significant only in the very dense and hot parts of the disk inside about 10 R Jup . As the H 2 O ice line will always be beyond these distances, inaccuracies in our results arising from an isothermal vertical model are negligible.</p><p>The heating terms (1)-(3) are derived based on precomputed planet evolution models (provided by courtesy of C. Mordasini, Mordasini 2013), which give us the planetary mass, planetary mass accretion rate ( ˙ M), and planetary luminosity (L p ) as a function of time (t) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. L p (t) is a key input parameter to our model as it determines F p (t), and it is sensitive to the planet's core mass. Yet, in the final stages of planetary accretion, L p differs by less than a factor of two for planetary cores between 22 to 130 Earth masses. With F p ∝ L p and temperature scaling roughly with (F p ) 1/4 , uncertainties in the midplane or surface temperatures of the disk are lower than 20 %, and uncertainties in the radial distance of the H 2 O ice line are as large as a few Jovian radii at most. For all our simulations the precomputed planetary models assume a final core mass of 33 Earth masses, which is about a factor of three larger than the mass of Jupiter's core <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Guillot et al. 1997</ref>). With higher final core masses meaning higher values for L p at any given accretion rate, we actually derive upper, or outer, limits for the special case of the H 2 O ice line around a Jupiter-like planet 5.2 AU around a Sun-like star.</p><p>We interpolate the Mordasini (2013) tracks on a linear scale with a time step of 1 000 yr and evaluate the four heating terms as a function of r, which extends from Jupiter's co-rotation radius (2.25 R Jup in our simulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sasaki et al. 2010</ref>) out to the disk's centrifugal radius (r cf ). At that distance, the centrifugal force acting on a gas parcel equals the gravitational pull of the planet. We compute r cf using the analytical expression of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Machida et al. (2008)</ref>, which they derived by fitting a power law expression to their 3D hydrodynamical simulations of circumplanetary accretion disks. In this model, r cf ∝ M 1/3 Jup for super-Jovian planets at a given stellar distance. Viscous heating is governed by the α viscosity parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shakura &amp; Sunyaev 1973)</ref>, which we fix to a value of 10 −3 in our simulations (for a discussion see <ref type="bibr">Sect. 4 in Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. Note that even variations of α by an order of magnitude would only change our results for the circumplanetary H 2 O ice line location during the final stages of planetary accretion by a few planetary radii at most, because then the disk is mostly heated by planetary illumination.</p><p>The sound velocity (c s ) in the disk midplane is evaluated as c s = 1.9 km s −1 √ T m (r)/1 000 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Keith &amp; Wardle 2014)</ref>, which is an adequate approximation since ionization can be neglected in the late stages of moon formation when disk temperatures are usually below 1 000 K. At each time step, we assume a steady-state gas surface density (Σ g ) that is derived analytically by solving the continuity equation of the mass inflow onto a centrifugally supported, viscous disk with a uniform flux per area <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canup &amp; Ward 2002)</ref>. The equations of energy transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva 2014</ref>) then allow us to derive the temperature profile both at the disk surface, where the optical depth τ = 2/3, and in the disk midplane. This model invokes absorption of planetary illumination in the disk photosphere at a height z s (r) above the midplane, modeled by an absorption coefficient (k s ), as well as the transport of energy through an optically thick disk to the surface, modeled by κ P . For the dust-to-gas Article number, page 3 of 11 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. ms  Once the planetary accretion rate has dropped to 10 M Gan Myr −1 at 1.43 Myr, the H 2 O ice line is at a similar location as in the Jupiter-like scenario, that is, between the orbits of Europa and Ganymede. ratio (X d ) we take a fiducial value of 0.006 <ref type="bibr">(Lunine &amp; Steven- son 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz 2013</ref>) in the inner dry regions of the disk, and we assume that it jumps by a factor of three at the H 2 O ice line. The resulting mathematical framework contains several implicit functions, which we solve in an iterative, numerical scheme. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> gives a complete overview of the parameters involved in the model. Our model neglects the effects of planetary migration, which is an adequate approximation because the planets don't migrate substantially within the ≈ 10 5 yr required for moon formation. We also do not actually simulate the accretion and buildup of moons <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ogihara &amp; Ida 2012)</ref>.</p><p>As an extension of our previous study, where all planets were considered at 5.2 AU around a Sun-like star, we here place hypothetical super-Jovian planets at stellar distances between 1 and 20 AU to a solar type host. Although the precomputed planet formation tracks were calculated at 5.2 AU around a Sun-like star, we may still consider different stellar distances because the accretion rates through any annulus in the circumstellar disk are roughly constant at any time (and thereby similar to the instantaneous stellar accretion rate). The surface densities of gas and solids are naturally lower at larger stellar separations. Hence, the accretion rates provided by the tracks will actually overestimate ˙ M and L p in wider orbits at any given time. However, this will not affect our procedure as we are not primarily interested in the evolution as a function of absolute times but rather as a function of accretion rates. In particular, we introduced the shutdown accretion ( ˙ M shut ) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014)</ref>, which we use as a measure to consider as the final stages of moon formation around accreting giant planets. ˙ M shut is a more convenient quantity (or independent variable) than time to refer to, because, first, the initial conditions of planet formation as well as the age of the system are often poorly constrained. And, second, accretion rates can be inferred more easily from observations than age. Hence, planetary accretion rates allow us to consider planet (and moon) formation at comparable stages, independent of the initial conditions.</p><p>Variations of the stellar distance will affect both the size of the circumplanetary accretion disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Machida et al. 2008</ref>) and the stellar heating term in our model <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva 2014</ref>). Disks around close-in planets are usually smaller (though not necessarily less massive) than disks around planets in wide stellar orbits owing to their smaller Hill spheres and their lower average specific angular momentum. Moreover, substantial stellar illumination will prevent these disks from having H 2 O ice lines in the vicinity of the star. The temperature of the circumstellar accretion disk, in which the planet is embedded, is calculated under the assumption that the disk is transparent to stellar irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hayashi 1981)</ref> and that the stellar luminosity equals that of the contemporary Sun. In this model, the circumstellar H 2 O ice line is located at 2.7 AU from the star. We will revisit the faint young Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sagan &amp; Mullen 1972)</ref> as well as other parameterizations of the circumstellar disk in an upcoming paper <ref type="bibr">(Heller et al. 2015, in prep.</ref>).</p><p>In Figs. 2 and 3 we show an application of our disk model to a Jupiter-mass and a 12 M Jup planet at 5.2 AU around a Sunlike star, respectively. All panels present the disk surface temperatures (T s , solid gray lines) and disk midplane temperatures (T m , solid black lines) as well as the contributions to T s from viscous heating (T v , black crosses), planetary illumination (T p , solid black lines), accretion onto the disk (T a , gray dashed lines), and heating from the circumstellar accretion disk, or "nebula" (T n , gray dotted lines). Any of these contributions to the disk surface temperature is computed assuming that all other contributions are zero. In other words, T v , T p , T a , and T n depict the temperature of the disk photosphere in the hypothetical case that viscous heating, planetary illumination, accretional heating onto the disk, or the stellar illumination were the single energy source, respectively. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The different slopes of these curves, in particular of T v and T p , lead to the appearance of heat transitions (not shown), which traverse the disk on relatively short time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. Also note that in all the simulations shown, the disk midplane is warmer than the disk surface. Only when accretion drops to about 10 M Gan Myr −1 in panels (b) do T s and T m become comparable throughout the disk, both around the Jupiter-and the super-Jupiter-mass planet.</p><p>Panels (a) in Figs. 2 and 3 are chosen at the time at which the H 2 O ice line first appears at the outer edge of the disk, while panels (b) illustrate the temperature distribution at the time when ˙ M = 10 M Gan , with M Gan as Ganymede's mass. During this epoch, the H 2 O ice line around the Jupiter-mass planet is safely between the orbital radii of Europa and Ganymede (see labeled arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b)</ref>, which suggests that this corresponds to the shutdown phase of moon formation. The colored symbols in each panel depict the rocky (orange) or icy (blue) composition of the Galilean moons. Symbol sizes scale with the actual moon radii. In these simulations, the Planck mean opacity (κ P ) has been fixed at a fiducial value of 10 −2 m 2 kg −1 throughout the disk and the disk absorptivity is assumed to be k s = 0.2.</p><p>A comparison of Figs. 2(a) and 3(a) shows that the centrifugal radius of the accretion disk around the Jovian planet (r c ≈ 27 R Jup ) is substantially smaller than the disk radius around the super-Jovian test planet (r c ≈ 80 R Jup ) -note the different distance ranges shown in the figures! Moreover, the midplanes and surfaces in the inner regions of the super-Jovian accretion disks are substantially hotter at any given distance around the super-Jupiter. Note also that planetary illumination is the main energy source around the Jupiter-mass planet in Figs. 2(a) and (b), while viscous heating plays an important role during the appearance of the H 2 O ice line around the super-Jovian planet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(a)</ref>. In the final stages of accretion onto the 12 M Jup planet, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3(b)</ref>, viscous heating and planetary illumination are comparable throughout the disk.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> we present the radial distributions of the gas surface densities around our Jovian and super-Jovian test planets. While solid lines refer to panels (a) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 2 and 3</ref>, dashed lines refer to panels (b), respectively. In particular, solid lines refer to that instant in time when the H 2 O ice lines first appear at the outer edges of the accretion disks around those two planets, whereas the dashed lines depict the accretion phase when ˙ M = 10 M Gan Myr −1 , which is the phase when the H 2 O ice line around our Jupiter-mass test planet is in good agreement with the compositional gradient observed in the Galilean system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. At any given planetary distance in these particular states, the super-Jovian planet has a gas surface density that is higher by about a factor of five compared to the Jupiter-mass planet. Moreover, we find that the H 2 O ice lines in both cases need about 10 5 yr to move radially from the outer disk edges to their final positions (see labels). Our values for Σ g are similar to those presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva (2014)</ref> in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. Similar to the procedure applied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014)</ref>, we performed a suite of simulations for planets with masses between 1 and 12 M Jup at 5.2 AU from a Sun-like star, where ˙ M shut and κ P were randomly drawn from a Gaussian probability distribution. For log 10 (κ P /[m 2 kg −1 ]) we took a mean value of −2 with a standard variation of 1 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bell et al. 1997</ref>, and references therein), and for log 10 ( ˙ M shut /[M Gan Myr −1 ]) we assumed a mean value of 1 with a standard variation of 1, which nicely reproduced the compositional H 2 O gradient in the Galilean moons <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>. As an extension of our previous simulations, we here consider various disk absorptivities (k s = 0.2 and 0.4) and examine the total mass of solids in the accretion disks, both as a function of time and as a function of stellar distance. Above all, we study the disappearance of the circumplanetary H 2 O ice line in the vicinity of the star.</p><p>Article number, page 5 of 11     In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>, we therefore analyze the evolution of M sld (in units of M Gan ) around these planets as a function of time. Indicated values for ˙ M along these tracks help to visualize M sld as a function of accretion rates (see crosses, squares, and circles), because time on the abscissa delivers an incomplete picture of the mass evolution due to the different timescales of these disks. We find that disks around lower-mass super-Jovians contain less solid mass at any given accretion rate than disks around higher-mass super-Jovians. Solids also occur earlier in time as the appearance of the disk itself is regulated by the shrinking of the initially very large planet in our models: lower-mass giant planets contract earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mordasini 2013)</ref>. Assuming that moon formation shuts down at similar accretion rates around any of the simulated planets, the example accretion rates (100, 10, 1 M Gan Myr −1 ) indicate an increase of the mass of solids as a function of M p . For a given ˙ M shut , this scaling is M sld ∝ M p (see also <ref type="bibr">Fig. 5 in Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014)</ref>, which is in agreement with the scaling relation for the total moon mass around giant planets found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Canup &amp; Ward (2006)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">H 2 O ice lines and total mass of solids around planets at various stellar distances</head><p>Having examined the sensitivity of our results to M p and to the disk's radiative properties, we now turn to the question of what exomoon systems are like around super-Jovian exoplanets at very different locations in their disks than our own Jupiter at 5.2 AU. Here, we shall encounter some significant surprises. <ref type="figure">Figure 8(a)</ref> shows the final circumplanetary distance of the H 2 O ice line around a Jupiter-mass planet between 2 and 20 AU from the star, 4 assuming a shutdown accretion rate of 100 M Gan Myr −1 . Different styles of the blue lines correspond to different disk opacities (see legend), while the solid black line indicates the radius of the circumplanetary accretion disk, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Machida et al. (2008)</ref>. Circles indicate the radial distances of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, at 5.2 AU from the star. In this set of simulations, the H 2 O ice lines always ends up between the orbits of Ganymede and Callisto, which is not in agreement with the observed H 2 O compositional gradient in the Galilean system. As stellar illumination decreases at larger distances while all other heating terms are constant for the given accretion rate, the ice lines move towards the planet at greater distances.</p><p>Most importantly, however, we find that Jovian planets closer than about 4.8 AU do not have an H 2 O ice line in the first place. Hence, if the large population of Jupiter-mass planets around 1 AU (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) formed in situ and without substantial inward migration from the outer regions, then these giant planets should not have had the capacity to form giant, icy moons, that is, scaled-up versions of Ganymede or Callisto. These giant moons with masses up to that of Mars (suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Canup &amp; Ward 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014</ref>), may only be present if they have completed their own water-rich formation beyond about 4.8 AU from their star, before they migrated to their current circumstellar orbits together with their host planets.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 8(b)</ref>, the planetary accretion rate has dropped by a factor of ten, and the ice lines have shifted. For κ P = 10 −2 m 2 kg −1 and κ P = 10 −1 m 2 kg −1 they moved towards the planet. But for κ P = 10 −3 m 2 kg −1 they moved outward. The former two rates actually place the H 2 O ice line around Jupiter at almost exactly the orbit of Ganymede, which is in better agreement with observations. In these simulations, Jovian planets closer than about 4.5 AU do not have a circumplanetary H 2 O ice line.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> we vary the stellar distance of a 12 M Jup planet. First, note that the disk (black solid line) is larger at any given stellar separation than in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Second, note that the H 2 O ice line for a given ˙ M shut in Figs. 9(a) and (b), respectively, is further out than in the former case of a Jupiter-mass planet. This is due to both increased viscous heating and illumination from the planet for the super-Jovian object. Nevertheless, the much larger disk radius overcompensates for this effect and, hence, all these simulations suggests that accretion disks around the most massive planets can have H 2 O ice lines if the planet is not closer than about 3.8 AU (panel a) to 3.1 AU (panel b) to a Sun-like star. The latter value refers to a shutdown accretion rate of 10 M Gan Myr −1 , which is in good agreement with the water ice distribution in the Galilean moon system. Assuming that moon formation stops at comparable accretion rates around super-Jovian planets, we consider a critical stellar distance of about 3 AU a plausible estimate for the critical stellar distance of a 12 M Jup accreting planet to show a circumplanetary H 2 O ice line. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> presents the total instantaneous mass of solids in circumplanetary accretion disk as a function of stellar distance for two different shutdown accretion rates and three different disk Planck opacities. The calculation of M sld follows Eq. <ref type="formula">(17)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014)</ref>, that is, we integrate the surface density of solids between the inner disk truncation radius and the outer centrifugal radius. Panel (a) for a Jupiter-mass planet demonstrates that indeed the amount of solids in its late accretion disk is negligible within about 4.5 AU from a Sun-like star. This gives us crucial insights into Jupiter's migration history within the Grand Tack framework ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Walsh et al. 2011</ref>), which we will present in a forthcoming paper ( <ref type="bibr">Heller et al. 2015, in prep.)</ref>. Moreover, both panels show that the effect of different disk opacities on M sld is small for a given M p and ˙ M shut . First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref> only considered viscous heating and planetary illumination. Our additional heating terms (accretion onto the disk and stellar illumination) contribute additional heat, which imply smaller accretion rates to let the H 2 O ice lines move close enough to the Jupiter-like planet. Second, the parameterization of planetary illumination in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref> model is different from ours. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref> assume an r −3/4 dependence of the midplane temperature from the planet (r being the planetary radial distance), we do not apply any predescribed r-dependence. In particular, T m (r) cannot be described properly by a simple polynomial due to the different slopes of the various heat sources as a function of planetary distance (see the black solid lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figs. 2 and 3)</ref>.</p><p>While our estimates of ˙ M shut are about three orders of magnitude lower than the values proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref>, they are also one to two orders of magnitude lower than the values suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alibert et al. (2005)</ref>. Their moon formation model is similar to the so-called "gas-starved" disk model applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref>. Accretion rates in their model were not derived from planet formation simulations (as in our case) but calculated using an analytical fit to previous simulations. Again, the additional energy terms in our model are one reason for the lower final accretion rates that we require in order to have the H 2 O ice line interior to the orbit of Ganymede.</p><p>Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva (2014) also studied Jupiter's accretion rates and their compatibility with the Galilean moon system. They found that values between 10 −9 M Jup yr −1 and 10 −6 M Jup yr −1 (about 10 M Gan Myr −1 to 10 4 M Gan Myr −1 ) satisfy these constraints. Obviously, our results are at the lower end of this range, while accretion rates up to three orders of magnitude higher should be reasonable according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Makalkin &amp; Dorofeeva (2014)</ref>. Yet, these authors also claimed that planetary illumination be negligible in the final states of accretion, which is not supported by our findings (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). We ascribe this discrepancy to the fact that they estimated the planetary luminosity (L p ) analytically, while in our model L p , R p , M p , and ˙ M are coupled in a sophisticated planet evolution model <ref type="bibr">(Mor- dasini 2013</ref> rapidly due to the planet's gap opening in the circumsolar disk (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014</ref>).</p><p>We also calculate the type I migration time scales (τ I ) of potential moons that form in our circumplanetary disks. Using Eq. <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Canup &amp; Ward (2006)</ref> and assuming a Ganymedemass moon, we find that 0.1 Myr τ I 100 Myr in the final stages of accretion, with the shortest time scales referring to close-in moons and early stages of accretion when the gas surface density is still high. Hence, since the remaining disk lifetime (≈ 10 6 yr) is comparable or smaller than the type I migration time scale, migration traps might be needed to stop the moons from falling into the planet. As the gas surface density is decreasing by about an order of magnitude per 10 5 yr (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1(c)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Heller &amp; Pudritz 2014</ref>) and since τ I is inversely proportional to Σ g , type I migration slows down substantially even if the protosatellites still grow. On the other hand, if a moon grows large enough to open up a gap in the circumplanetary accretion disk, then type II (inwards) migration might kick in, reinforcing the need for moon migration traps. All these issues call for a detailed study of moon migration under the effects of ice lines and other traps.</p><p>Another issue that could cause moon loss is given by their possible tidal migration. If a planet rotates very slowly, its corotation radius will be very wide and any moons would be forced to tidally migrate inwards (ignoring mean motion resonances for the time being). But if the planet rotates quickly and is not subject to tides raised by the star, such as Jupiter, then moons usually migrate outwards due to the planetary tides and at some point they might become gravitationally unbound. <ref type="bibr">Barnes &amp; O'Brien (2002, see their</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref> showed that Mars-mass moons around giant planets do not fall into the planet and also remain bound for at least 4.6 Gyr if the planet is at least 0.17 AU away from a Sunlike star. Of course, details depend on the exact initial orbit of the moon and on the tidal parameterization of the system, but as we consider planets at several AU from the star, we conclude that loss of moons due to tidal inward or outward migration is not an issue. Yet, it might have an effect on the orbital distances where we can expect those giant moons to be found, so additional tidal studies will be helpful.</p><p>Article number, page 9 of 11 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. ms</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>If the abundant population of super-Jovian planets at about 1 AU and closer to Sun-like stars formed in situ, then our results suggest that these planets could not form massive, super-Ganymedestyle moons in their accretion disks. These disks would have been too small to feature H 2 O ice lines and therefore the growth of icy satellites. The accretion disks around these planets might still have formed massive, rocky moons, similar in composition to Io or Europa, which would likely be in close orbits (thereby raising the issue of tidal evolution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes &amp; O'Brien 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cas- sidy et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Porter &amp; Grundy 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller &amp; Barnes 2013;</ref>), since circumplanetary accretion disks at 1 AU are relatively small. If these large, close-orbit rocky moons exist, they also might be subject to substantial tidal heating. Alternatively, super-Jovians might have captured moons, e.g. via tidal disruption of binary systems during close encounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Williams 2013)</ref>, so there might exist independent formation channels for giant, possibly water-rich moons at 1 AU.</p><p>If, however, these super-Jovian planets formed beyond 3 to 4.5 AU and then migrated to their current locations, then they could be commonly orbited by Mars-mass moons with up to 50 % of water, similar in composition to Ganymede and Callisto. Hence, the future detection or non-detection of such moons will help to constrain rather strongly the migration history of their host planets. What is more, Mars-mass ocean moons at about 1 AU from Sun-like stars might be abundant extrasolar habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Williams et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller &amp; Barnes 2013;</ref>),</p><p>Our results raise interesting questions about the formation of giant planets with satellite systems in the solar system and beyond. The field of moon formation around super-Jovian exoplanets is a new research area, and so many basic questions still need to be answered.</p><p>(1) The "Grand Tack". In the "Grand Tack" scenario ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Walsh et al. 2011</ref>), the fully accreted Jupiter migrated as close as 1.5 AU to the Sun during the first few million years of the solar system, then got caught in a mean-motion orbital resonance with Saturn and then moved outward to about 5 AU. Our results suggest that the icy moons Ganymede and Callisto can hardly have formed during the several 10 5 yr Jupiter spent inside 4.5 AU to the Sun. If they formed before Jupiter's tack, could their motion through the inner solar system be recorded in these moons today? Alternatively, if Callisto required 10 5 -10 6 yr to form <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canup &amp; Ward 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mosqueira &amp; Estrada 2003)</ref> and assuming that Jupiter's accretion disk was intact until after the tack, one might suppose that Ganymede and Callisto might have formed thereafter. But then how did Jupiter's accretion disk reacquire the large amounts of H 2 O that would then be incorporated into Callisto after all water had been sublimated during the tack? We will address these issues in a companion paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heller et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>(2) Migrating planets. Future work will need to include the actual migration of the host planets, which we neglected in this paper. Namouni (2010) studied the orbital stability of hypothetical moons about migrating giant planets, but the formation of these moons was not considered. Yet, the timing of the accretion evolution, the gap opening, the movement within the circumstellar disk (and thereby the varying effect of stellar heating), and the shutdown of moon formation will be crucial to fully assess the possibility of large exomoons at about 1 AU. These simulations should be feasible within the framework of our model, but the precomputed planet evolution tracks would need to consider planet migration. Ultimately, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary accretion disks around migrating super-Jovian planets might draw a full picture.</p><p>(3) Directly imaged planets. Upcoming ground-based extremely large telescopes such as the E-ELT and the Thirty Meter Telescope, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope have the potential to discover large moons transiting directly imaged planets in the infrared <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Peters &amp; Turner 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Heller &amp; Albrecht 2014)</ref>. Exomoon hunters aiming at these young giant planets beyond typically 10 AU from the star will need to know how moon formation takes place in these possibly very extended circumplanetary accretion disks, under negligible stellar heating, and in the low-density regions of the circumstellar accretion disk.</p><p>(4) Ice line traps. If circumplanetary H 2 O ice lines can act as moon migration traps and if solids make up a substantial part of the final masses accreted by the planet, then the accretion rates onto giant planets computed under the neglect of moons might be incorrect in the final stages of accretion. The potential of the H 2 O ice line to act as a moon migration trap is new <ref type="bibr">(Heller &amp; Pu- dritz 2014</ref>) and needs to be tested. It will therefore be necessary to compute the torques acting on the accreting moons within the circumplanetary accretion disk as well as the possible gap opening in the circumplanetary disk by large moons, which might trigger type II migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canup &amp; Ward 2002</ref>).</p></div>

This distance range is almost independent of the final planetary mass and weakly dependent on the disk's absorption properties <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5)</ref>. With more massive planets having more extended accretion disks, this means that more massive planets have larger fractions (up to 70 %) of their disks beyond the circumplanetary H 2 O ice line (compared to about 25 % around Jupiter, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>).</p><p>Jupiter-mass planets forming closer than about 4.5 AU to a Sun-like star do not have a circumplanetary H 2 O ice line <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8)</ref>, depending on the opacity details of the circumstellar disk. A detailed application of this aspect to the formation of the Galilean satellites might help constraining the initial conditions of the Grand Tack paradigm. Due to their larger disks, the most massive super-Jovian planets can host an H 2 O ice line as close as about 3 AU to Sun-like stars <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9</ref>). With the circumstellar H 2 O ice line at about 2.7 AU in our model of an optically thin circumstellar disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hayashi 1981)</ref>, the relatively small accretion disks around Jupiter-mass planets at several AU from Sun-like stars thus substantially constrain the formation of icy moons. The extended disks around super-Jovian planets, on the other hand, might still form icy moons even if the planet is close to the circumstellar H 2 O ice line.</p><p>We find an approximation for the total mass available for moon formation (M T ), which is a function of both M p and r ⋆ (see Eq. 2). The linear dependence of M T ∝ M p has been known before, but the dependence on stellar distance (M T ∝ r 1.16 ⋆ , for r ⋆ ≥ 5.2 AU) is new. It is based on our finding that an accretion rate M shut ≈ 10 M Gan /10 6 yr <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref> yields the best results for the position of the circumjovian H 2 O ice line at the shutdown of the formation of the Galilean moons <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>; and Article number, page 10 of 11 R.

As a result, future detections or non-detections of exomoons around giant planets can help to distinguish between the two scenarios because they are tracers of their host planets' migration histories.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Figures 2 (</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figures 2(a) and (b) show that the temperature distribution in the late accretion disks around Jupiter-mass planets is determined mostly by the planetary illumination rather than viscous heating. This indicates a key difference between moon formation in circumplanetary accretion disks and planet formation in circumstellar disks, where the positions of ice lines have been shown to depend mostly on viscous heating rather than stellar illumination (Min et al. 2011; Hasegawa &amp; Pudritz 2011). In this context, Figs. 3(a) and (b) depict an interesting intermediate case in terms of the mass of the central object, where both viscous heating and illumination around a 12 M Jup planet show comparable contributions towards the final stages of accretion in panel (b). Also note that in Fig. 3(b) the temperature distribution in the disk outskirts is determined by the background temperature provided by stellar illumination. This suggests that the extended disks around super-Jovian exoplanets in wide circumstellar orbits (beyond about 10 AU) might also feature CO and other ice lines due to the even weaker stellar illumination. Figures 5(a) and (b) display the radial positions of the circumplanetary H 2 O ice lines around a range of planets with masses between 1 and 12 M Jup in the final stages of accretion, where we randomized κ P and ˙ M shut as described above, and the stellar distance is 5.2 AU for all planets considered. Panel (a) shows the same data as Fig. 4 in Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014), while panel (b) assumes k s = 0.4. The larger absorptivity in panel (b) pushes the H 2 O ice lines slightly away from the accreting planets compared to panel (a) for all planets except for the 12 M Jup planet, which we ascribe to an insignificant statistical fluctuation. As a key result of our new simulations for k s = 0.4, and in agreement with our previous study, the H 2 O ice line is between about 15 and 30 R Jup for all super-Jovian planets and almost independent of M p . The effect of changing k s by a factor of two is moderate, pushing the H 2 O ice line outward by only a few R Jup on average.</figDesc></figure>

Now the ordinate gives the circumplanetary distance in units of the fractional disk radius, and so the H 2 O ice lines are located closer to the planet with increasing M p . This is a consequence of the larger disk sizes of the more massive planets. In other words, larger giant planets have larger fractions of the accretion disks beyond the H 2 O ice lines. Naturally, this means that these super-Jovians should form the most massive, icy moons.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Throughout the paper, our reference to &quot;super-Jovian&quot; planets includes planets with masses between that of Jupiter (M Jup ) and 12 M Jup , where the latter demarcates the transition into the brown dwarf regime. Article number, page 1 of 11</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> Data from the Kepler space telescope suggests, however, that terrestrial planets are more abundant at about 1 AU around Sun-like stars than gas giant planets (Dong &amp; Zhu 2013; Mulders et al. 2015).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> As an example, T v is calculated setting F acc = F p = T neb = 0 in Eq. (13) of Heller &amp; Pudritz (2014).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We also simulated planets as close as 0.2 AU to the star, but their accretion disks are nominally smaller than the planetary radius, indicating a departure of our model from reality. Anyways, since the hypothetical disks around these planets do not harbor H 2 O ice lines and moon formation in the stellar vicinity is hard in the first place (Barnes &amp; O&apos;Brien 2002; Namouni 2010), we limit Fig. 10 to 2 AU.</note>

			<note place="foot">Canup &amp; Ward (2002) argued that accretion rates of 2 × 10 −7 M Jup yr −1 (or about 2.6 × 10 4 M Gan Myr −1 ) best reproduce the disk conditions in which the Galilean system formed. Based on the condition that the H 2 O ice line needs to be between the orbits of Europa and Ganymede at the final stages of accretion, our calculations predict a shutdown accretion rate that is considerably lower, closer to 10 M Gan Myr −1 (see Fig. 8). The difference in these results is mainly owed to two facts.</note>
