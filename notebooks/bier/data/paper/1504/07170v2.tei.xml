			<abstract>
				<p>We have investigated the evaporation of close-in exoplanets irradiated by ionizing photons. We find that the properties of the flow are controlled by the ratio of the recombination time to the flow timescale. When the recombination timescale is short compared to the flow timescale the the flow is in approximate local ionization equilibrium with a thin ionization front, where the photon mean free path is short compared to flow scale. In this &quot;recombination limited&quot; flow the mass-loss scales roughly with the square root of the incident flux. When the recombination time is long compared to the flow timescale the ionization front becomes thick and encompasses the entire flow, with the mass-loss rate scaling linearly with flux. If the planet&apos;s potential is deep the flow is approximately &quot;energy-limited&quot;; however, if the planet&apos;s potential is shallow we identify a new limiting mass-loss regime, which we term &quot;photon-limited&quot;. In this scenario the mass-loss rate is purely limited by the incoming flux of ionizing photons. We have developed a new numerical approach that takes into account the frequency dependence of the incoming ionizing spectrum and performed a large suite of 1D simulations to characterise UV driven mass-loss around low mass planets. We find the flow is &quot;recombination-limited&quot; at high fluxes but becomes &quot;energy-limited&quot; at low fluxes; however, the transition is broad occurring over several order of magnitude in flux. Finally, we point out the transitions between the different flow types does not occur at a single flux value, but depends on the planet&apos;s properties, with higher mass planets becoming &quot;energy-limited&quot; at lower fluxes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Observational campaigns to detect exoplanets have been incredibly successful, having found thousands of possible exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). However, what's surprising is that many of the exoplanets are found to be incredibly close to their parent stars with separations &lt; 0.1 AU being common. Furthermore, while the original detected planets at small separations were massive (of order a Jupiter mass and higher) -so called "hot jupiters" -these are relatively rare ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). With the advent of the Kepler mission the majority of planets found close to their parent star are small radius, low mass objects, with the majority of stars containing at least one small ( 4 R ⊕ ) planet with a period shorter than Mercury's ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>). This indicates that the formation of close-in small planets is a dominant mode of planet formation.</p><p>At such close separations, the environment is very different to planets in our own solar system and irradiation from the central star can play a very important role, particularly when the star is young (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Owen &amp; Wu, 2013)</ref> or during the late stages of stellar evolution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bear &amp; Soker, 2011;</ref>. The star's bolometric luminosity can heat-up the planet's atmosphere leading to an increased scale height, as well as preventing the planet from cooling ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Guillot et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Burrows et al. 2000</ref>, Baraffe jowen@ias.edu <ref type="bibr">1 Hubble Fellow et al. 2003</ref>). Furthermore, the high energy ionizing luminosity from the star can heat-up the upper layers to temperatures of order the escape temperature, leading to mass-loss (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lammer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Owen &amp; Jackson, 2012</ref>. When the star is relatively young (&lt; several 100 Myr old) the ionizing luminosity can represent a significant fraction of the total output of the star ∼ 10 −3 L * <ref type="bibr">(Jack- son et al. 2012</ref>). Integrating the total received ionizing luminosity over Gyr time-scales and comparing it to the binding energy of close in planets it was realised that planetary evaporation could play a significant evolutionary role and actually remove a large fraction of the planet's atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lammer et al. 2003</ref>), especially at low planet masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Owen &amp; Jackson 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, Lopez et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Owen &amp; Wu 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013</ref>.</p><p>Due to the importance of the evolutionary effects of planetary evaporation one requires accurate mass-loss rates. Commonly the approach is to turn a certain fraction of the received ionizing luminosity into work/heating and associated mass-loss, either globally ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lammer et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Erkaev et al. 2007</ref>) and obtain the well known "energy-limited" mass-loss rate; or locally in simplified simulations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Yelle et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Tian et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, Lam- mer et al. 2013</ref>). Such an approach implicitly assumes that P dV work dominates the energy loss and radiative cooling or ionization physics are unimportant.</p><p>More detailed studies have since been performed that take into consideration some of the details of radiative transfer and ionization chemistry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koskinen et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Koskinen et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koskinen et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chadney et al. 2014</ref>); however, these models typically concentrate on a handful of observed hot jupiters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> considered the role Xrays play and showed heating from secondary ionization and line cooling were important when the sonic point occurred in an area of the flow dominated by X-ray heating and argued that in this case the flow was never "energy-limited". <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> also presented a schematic picture of when UV or X-ray heating dominates and argued that X-rays would dominant for the highest fluxes around low-mass planets. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref> considered the evaporation for a hot jupiter with mass 0.7 M J and radius 1.4 R J with a pure UV radiation field at various fluxes. At high fluxes 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 , they found the flow to be in approximate radiation-recombination equilibrium, in this case the flow behaved like a HII region, was fully ionized and approximately isothermal with a temperature of 10 4 K and the cooling was dominated by Lyman-α radiation. As the density in any HII region scales with as J</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1/2 0</head><p>(where J 0 is the ionizing flux in photons per unit time), then the mass-loss rate in this regime scale approximately as J 1/2 0 . At fluxes 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 the density in the flow was so low that recombination were too slow compared to the flow time and the mass loss rate then scaled linearly with flux. In this case ionizations were balanced approximately by advection, which Murray-Clay et al. 2009 identified as an "energy-limited" flow.</p><p>The physical understanding of the transition for "recombination-limited" to an "energy-limited" flow being that once the density drops in the flow such that the recombination time is long compared to the flow time then it can no-longer be in radiative-recombination equilibrium (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Soker, 1999</ref>). This obviously depends on planet properties, through the flow time (e.g. planet radius and mass); and as such the transition flux below which the flow cannot be in radiative-recombination equilibrium is not going to be a unique value. However, several studies of exoplanet evolution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jin et al. 2014</ref>) take the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref> for their single planet study and apply it to all planets which is likely to lead to widely inaccurate adopted mass-loss rates.</p><p>In this paper we aim to study the properties of UV driven evaporation across the range of observed exoplanets, particularity at low masses which has as yet been unexplored. We aim to put forward a simple physical understanding of the various evaporation regimes and identify three: "recombination-limited", "energy-limited" and a new regime "photon-limited". We present an analytic picture in Section 2, perform a numerical study with a new radiation-hydrodynamic scheme in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss our results and summarise in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ANALYTIC OVERVIEW</head><p>The evaporative flow problem is complicated by the fact that in general the flow may not be in local thermodynamic or ionization equilibrium, particularly at low fluxes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>). However, in the case of irradiation by a spectrum dominated by Hydrogen ionizing photons (EUV) we can make progress by considering ionization balance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bertoldi &amp; Mckee, 1990)</ref>. We consider a planet with mass M p and radius R p close to its central star at a separation a. Noting that R p /a 1, then the EUV flux is constant on all scales of interest. We consider a flow that is dived into three distinct regions: (i) bolometrically heated planet's atmosphere; where the temperature is set by the flux of optical photons and the optical depth to EUV photons is large such that the ionization fraction (X) is very low.</p><p>(ii) an "ionization front" where the photo-ionization rate greatly exceeds the recombination rate and the ionization fraction increases as one moves away from the planet. (iii) a fully ionized region where photo-ionization is balanced by recombinations and the ionization fraction is unity 2 .</p><p>Since the scale height of the planet's bolometrically heated atmosphere must be R for a bound planet then the transition from the bolometrically heated atmosphere (region i) to the ionization front (region ii) is by construction sharp. In the picture we develop below we take it to occur at an optical depth τ EUV = 1 to the EUV photons and call this radius the planet's radius. However, unlike many problems in astrophysics involving EUV radiation, as we shall see we cannot in general assume that the ionization front is thin compared to the flow scale (or even the planet's scale) and in many cases we find a transition from region ii to region iii occurs at a very large radius. In particular, if it occurs at a radius larger than the sonic radius then it is irrelevant in determining the mass-loss and we assume the flow to only contain regions i and ii.</p><p>We choose to work in one-dimensional spherically symmetric picture along a streamline connecting the star and planet (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Stone &amp; Proga, 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Owen &amp; Adams, 2014</ref> for the role of multi-dimensional flows). For the sake of clarity we neglect the contribution from the tidal gravity due to the star. For a steady-state, spherically symmetric flow the governing equations of hydrodynamics are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∂ ∂r µr 2 nu = 0 (1) u ∂u ∂r + 1 ρ ∂P ∂r + GM p r 2 = 0 (2) 1 r 2 ∂ ∂r ur 2 ρE + P − GM p ρ r = q (3)</formula><p>where µ is the mean-molecular weight given by µ = m H /(1 + X), with X the ionization fraction; G is the gravitational constant; n is the number density of Hydrogen nuclei; ρ = nµ the mass density; u the gas velocity; P = k b nT the gas pressure, where T is the temperature; E is the total specific energy density and q is the net volumetric heating rate, which is detailed in Section 3.1. Furthermore steady state ionization balance requires (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bertoldi &amp; McKee 1990</ref>, their Equation 2.1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J 0 = F IF − Rp ∞ dR α R X 2 n 2 (4)</formula><p>where α R is the recombination rate and F IF is the flux of ionizing photons into the ionization front. Since recombination are negligible inside the ionization front then F IF must balance the flux of neutral particles into the ionization front ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Churchwell et al. 1987</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Bertoldi &amp; McKee 1990</ref>. Namely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F IF = n(R p )u(R p )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Note since the radiation field is plane parallel, Equation 4 is written in plane parallel form. Since the flow is approximately spherical we must be careful combining Equation 4 with the hydrodynamic terms, something we discuss further in Section 2.1.1. Specifically, we cannot trivially integrate Equation 5 over the surface of the planet by multiplying by 4πR 2 p to find the mass-loss rate, since the total number of ionizing photons entering the ionizing front does not necessarily equal the total number reaching the base of the atmosphere, as some may pass through the flow without interacting with the it. Equation 3 can be recast into a limiting mass-loss, the "energy-limited" mass-loss rate where uncertainties in heating and cooling are encapsulated into an efficiency parameter η which can only be determined through numerical calculations with values typically in the range 0.01-0.3 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson, 2012)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">˙ M ≤ η πR 3 p J 0 h¯ ν h 4GM p (6)</formula><p>where h¯ ν h is the mean photon energy that goes into heating (rather than ionization). The origin of the factor 4 in the denominator comes from averaging the received flux by a πR 2 p disc over the 4πR 2 p surface area of the planet. We choose to this form as it is the commonly used form in the exoplanet literature and allows comparisons of the efficiency (η) values, although we note some authors do not perform such an averaging (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray- Clay et al. 2009</ref>). For a flow that can be considered close to being energy-limited requires that q is predominately controlled by heating and radiative cooling is a small contribution. Therefore, energy losses are dominated by P dV work or advection. The main contribution to the radiative cooling rate Λ is Lyα radiation with cooling rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Black 1981)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Λ = 7.5 × 10 −19 erg cm −3 s −1 n e n 0 exp −118348 K T (7)</formula><p>The ionization state of the gas is controlled by the recombination rate; adopting the on-the-spot approximation such that α R = α B where α B is the case-B recombination coefficient given by α B = 2.6 × 10 −13 cm 3 s −1 (T /10 4 K) −0.7 so that the recombination rate Λ ion is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Λ ion = α B n 2 e (8)</formula><p>where n e is the electron density. Noting the ratio of the cooling time-scale (t c ) to the recombination time-scale (t r ) is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">t c t r = k b T Λ ion Λ (9)</formula><p>and is purely a function of temperature and ionization fraction. When the gas is close to ∼ 10 4 K and roughly in ionization-recombination equilibrium then t c /t r ≈ 0.05. However, if the flow were no longer in local ionization equilibrium and the temperature falls below 10 4 K. The temperature falls because the heating rate and ionization rate scale identically with the ionizing flux; therefore, since the ionizing photons are unable to obtain ionization equilibrium they are unable to heat the gas to 10 4 K temperature (i.e. the ratio of the heating to ionization time-scale is a constant). Thus, P dV cooling becomes the dominant cooling mechanism (e.g. Murray-Clay et al. 2009), so we find t c /t r ∼ exp(−10 5 K/T ). Thus, t c quickly becomes longer than the recombination time when the flow is no longer in local ionization equilibrium. Since local ionization balance breaks down when when the recombination time becomes longer than the flow time-scale t flow , then one would expect that in the majority of the cases t c &gt; t flow when T &lt; 10 4 K and the flow will be close to "energy-limited" (c.f. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Soker 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Bear &amp; Soker 2011</ref>). This does not mean that Equation 6 will provide an accurate description of the mass-loss rate over the range of parameters of interest as η may still vary considerably due to hydrodynamic effects.</p><p>2.1. Limiting cases Inspection of Equation 4 &amp; 6 indicate that three physical processes may limit the mass-loss. Either the number of incoming photons, recombinations or energy considerations. Equating J 0 with the advection term in Equation 4 indicates that the flow will be limited by the number of incoming ionization photons -a processes we term "photon-limited". Equating J 0 with the recombination term in Equation 4 results in a density in the ionization front that is determined only by radiation-recombination balance -a processes we will term "recombination-limited". Finally, insisting that the flow satisfies Equation 6 will result in a flow that is limited by the available energy, this has become known commonly as "energy-limited" evaporation. In this case the mass-loss rate is described by taking Equation 6 as an equality where η is yet to be determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Photon limited flows</head><p>This corresponds to the case where the ionization front encompasses the entire flow (including the sonic point) and as such recombinations are completely negligible in the flow so that F IF = J 0 = n(R p )u(R p ). Additionally the pull of gravity is weak and the inequality in Equation 6 is easily satisfied. Note we are implicitly assuming that the gas temperature is high enough that the gas is able to escape freely. . Therefore, we are limited by the number of incoming ionizing photons: namely we can only loose one atom per incoming photon. Note we are implicitly assuming that the gas temperature reached in the ionization front is high enough that escape from the planet's potential is possible; if not the flow becomes "energy-limited" as we will discuss in Section 2. However, here we are complicated by geometric effects. For uniform spherical irradiation then the total number of absorbed photons is the area out to the ionization front, not the planet's radius itself. However, planet evaporation does not occur with spherical irradiation, but rather plane parallel. Furthermore, since the ionization front is marginally optically thin ionizing photons, then any photons with an impact parameter much larger than the planets radius, but smaller than the ionization front radius are likely to pass straight through the flow. Therefore, we can approximate the effective absorbing area of the planet as ∼ πR 2 p . Therefore, in order to obtain the photon limited mass-loss rate we drop the recombination integral in Equation 4 and equating J 0 and the advection allows us to calculate the mass-loss rate approximately as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">˙ M PL ≈ πR 2 p m H J 0<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We note that we do not need to make assumptions about the energy considerations here as we do not need to know the gas temperature to find the mass-loss rates. Such a mass-loss limit has not previously been discussed in the context of planet evaporation. Thus, it will corresponds to cases where planetary gravity is not strong and the flux is low, so namely low-mass planets at large separations and early times. Unfortunately, due to the fact any 1D model essentially assumes spherically symmetric irradiation any photon limited mass-loss rate is likely to be much higher than this value (since the effective absorbing area in such a calculation is πR 2 IF and R IF &gt; R p often with R IF R p ). Therefore, in our numerical calculations presented in Section 3 we will not be able to study this limit of planet evaporation. Any numerical constraints on "photon-limited" evaporation must be obtained with 2/3D numerical calculations. Although, Equation 10 should roughly represent an appropriate estimate for the mass-loss rate, and is similar to the 1+1D numerical calculations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bertoldi &amp; McKee (1990)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Recombination limited flows</head><p>"Recombination-limited" flows are perhaps the easiest to understand as in this case the radiative transfer and hydrodynamics problems are essentially de-coupled and the basics in the context of planetary evaporation were discussed in Murray- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Clay et al. (2009)</ref>. When the recombination time is short compared to the flow time-scale the ionization front becomes thin compared to the flow scale and essentially the transition from region i to region iii can be considered infinitesimally thin. Furthermore, the gas is thermostated to approximately 10 4 K and approximately isothermal. For cases when the planet's gravity is strong enough that the scale height in 10 4 K is small compared to the planet's radius then one can approximate the density structure close to the planet as hydrostatic and the integral in Equation 4 becomes (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Rp ∞ dR α R X 2 n 2 ≈ α B n 2 b c 2 s R 2 p 2GM p (11)</formula><p>where n b is the density at the ionization front. However, in the case that the planet's gravity is weak then the density profile will be roughly that of a constant velocity outflow and will fall of as r −2 . Therefore, in this case the integral in Equation 4 becomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnstone et al. 1998</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Rp ∞ dR α R X 2 n 2 ≈ α B n 2 b R p 3<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Writing the term in parenthesis in Equations 11 and 12 as a scale height H then we crudely set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H = min R p 3 , c 2 s R 2 p 2GM p<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Therefore, we can write the base density as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">n b = J 0 α B H<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Now we can write the recombination-limited mass-loss rate, noting in fully ionized flow µ = m H /2 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">˙ M RL = 2πR 2 p m H n b c s M b (15)</formula><p>where M b is the Mach velocity at the base of the flow.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Picture of Evaporation across parameter space</head><p>For fixed mass, since ˙ M EL ∝ ηR p 3 and ˙ M PL ∝ R 2 p , (i.e. they intercept once) then we note that there are two possible cases. Either the flow is "recombinationlimited" at all possible radii (high masses and high fluxes) or the flow is "recombination-limited" at both large radii (where ˙ M RL ∝ R 3/2 p ) and at small radii where it has an steep dependence on radius. Furthermore, since "photon-limited" mass-loss has a shallower dependence on radius than "energy-limited" then photon limited flows will dominate at larger planetary radii and lower masses than "energy-limited". The transition between "photon-limited" and "energy-limited" flows can be found by taking Equation 6 as an equality and equating it with Equation 10 to find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">M p = η h¯ ν h 4Gm h R p<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Note this expression indicates that when the photon energy is much larger that the depth of the gravitational potential, then the photon limit is the relevant one at low fluxes (i.e. we can assume heating is sufficient to allow the atmosphere to escape as we adopt in Section 2.1.1). Whereas, when the photon energy is much less than the depth of gravitational potential, the energy limit is the relevant one at low fluxes as one cannot assume the gas can escape freely.</p><p>One can find the transition between "recombinationlimited" and both "photon-limited" and "energylimited" by equating Equation 15 with Equations 10 &amp; 6 respectively to find:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">W 0 − R p R s −4 exp 3 − 4R s R p = − J 0 α B H 4c 2 s<label>(19)</label></formula><p>for the transition between "recombination-limited" and "photon-limited" and</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">W 0 − R p R s −4 exp 3 − 4R s R p = −η J 0 α B H 4c 2 s × R p h¯ ν h GM p m h<label>(20)</label></formula><p>for the the transition between "recombination-limited" and "energy-limited" where we note the last term in brackets is the ratio of the photon energy to binding energy. <ref type="bibr">Equations 19 &amp; 20</ref> posses either two solution or no solutions and cannot be presented in closed form. Therefore, we proceed graphically.</p><p>In computing the various mass-loss regimes we assume that the mass-loss efficiency is constant with planet radius and mass. As lowering the efficiency reduces the energy limited mass-loss rate this makes this limit more restrictive and increases the range of parameters over which the flow can be characterised by energy-limited evaporation. For our fiducial case we take h¯ ν h = 6.4 eV, η = 0.1 and use an EUV flux of 3 × 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 and the various mass-loss regimes are shown in top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In our panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we also show a recent census of the exoplanet population as points.</p><p>This moderate flux corresponds roughly to a separation of 0.2 AU around a young star and 0.04 AU for a 1 Gyr old star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jackson et al. 2012</ref>). In this example we see that jupiter mass and above planets are evaporating in the recombination limit, whereas most sub-jupiter mass planets are losing mass in an energy limited fashion. For very low mass planets (∼M ⊕ ) we find that evaporation is photon limited. We note that while most planets evolve to the left in the diagram as they shrink this is only a minor adjustment for massive planets. However, planets with envelope mass-fractions of order 10s of percent can be much larger at early times, and can often have radii 5-10 times large than at Gyr ages when they are observed today <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In the bottom left and top right panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we explore the role incident flux plays, with fluxes of 3 × 10 3 and 3 × 10 5 erg s −1 cm −2 respectively. As one expects at lower fluxes the parameter space dominated by energylimited and photon-limited flows, with the majority of planets loosing mass in an energy limited fashion and a small minority in a photon limited picture. While massive (&gt; M J ) planets still remain in the recombination limit.</p><p>Alternatively at high fluxes no planets are in the photon-limited picture and the energy limited flow occupies a small fraction of parameter space and most planets are evaporating in the recombination limited scenario. Since at this flux the majority of planets that sit in the energy limited-region are low mass. In order to experience fluxes of this magnitude requires the planets to been irradiated at early time (&lt; 100 Myr -Jackson et al. 2012,</p><p>Owen &amp; Wu 2013) and as such the planets plotted here would have been considerably larger and most would sit to the right of the energy-limited region.</p><p>Finally, we investigate how the mass-loss efficiency parameter in the energy-limited flows affects the parameter space. In the bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we show our fiducial model, but with an efficiency parameter of η = 0.3 corresponding to the upper range found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref>. As expected increasing the efficiency parameter reduces the importance of the energylimit and the majority of low mass planets are now in the photon-limit. Whereas energy-limited evaporation is constrained to intermediate mass-planets.</p><p>The picture described here is consistent with the study of Murray-Clay et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_17">(2009)</ref> who studied a 0.7 M J planet with a radius of 10 10 cm as a range of fluxes and found that the flow transitions from recombination limited at high fluxes to energy limited at low fluxes around ∼ 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 , consistent with our calculations that predict a transition flux of ∼ 2 × 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 . Now we can build up a picture for the mass-loss histories of both low mass planets ( 20M ⊕ ) and high mass planets (∼M J ). Close-in high mass planets begin evaporating in the recombination limited regime, as they evolve and the EUV flux falls with time they may transition to energy limited at some low flux, for typical parameters this is about 10 4 erg s −1 cm −2 ; however, we note that this is a strong function of planet mass and radius (as the transition occurs when R p /R s 1). Similarly, close-in low mass planets will begin evaporating in the recombination limit as they contract significantly due to cooling and the flux drops they may make a transition to photon-limited evaporation; however as the flux drops further and they contract even more they will eventually transition to energy limited evaporation. Whether or not low-mass planets experience photon-limited evaporation and when they make the transition from recombination to photon to energy limited is non-trivial. What is certain is there is not a unique value of the flux that one transitions from one regime to the other as assumed in previous evolutionary studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jin et al. 2014</ref>). Furthermore, our analysis presented here makes no effort to quantify what the efficiency of energy limited flow is and that can only be answered by numerical calculations such as those we preform in the next Section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS</head><p>In the previous section we have put forward the basic physical picture of planetary evaporation driven by EUV radiation, and their scalings. However, the actual massloss rates are still unknown as the details of the picture remain unquantified. In particular, the efficiency of any energy limited flow, or the exact temperature profile of any radiation recombination limited flow is sensitive to the exact details of the heating and cooling.</p><p>Furthermore, since we only expect the ionization front to be thin in the case of a flow which is recombination limited, and as we shall see it often the scale of the planet, one cannot assume a monochromatic irradiation field (as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>) and radiation hardening will need to be taken into account. Thus, the only way to obtain an accurate picture of planetary evaporation we must proceed and perform numerical calculations.  We follow many other previous approaches and consider 1D spherically symmetric outflow, where we solve the problem along a streamline connecting the star and planet, neglecting the Coriolis force. Along this streamline we solve the radiation-hydrodynamic problem including EUV irradiation, and non-equilibrium heating/cooling and Hydrogen ionization chemistry. We use the zeus-MP hydrodynamics code <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Stone &amp; Norman, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Hayes et al. 2006</ref>), which has been previously used for planetary evaporation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Owen &amp; Adams, 2014)</ref> and add to it a new module to perform the radiativetransfer, ionization structure and heating and cooling update.</p><p>As discussed in Section 2.1.1, our numerical setup will result in a "photon-limited" mass-loss rate that is too high compared to reality. In fact in all simulations we perform we find that the photon limited rate of our spherically symmetric setup is much higher than any measured mass-loss rates. As such in our numerical study here we only investigate the transition between energy and recombination limited and we must leave an investigation of the transition to photon limited flows to future multidimensional calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Ionizing radiative transfer</head><p>Ionizing radiative transfer can be solved most efficiently in a causal manner where one performs the ray tracing calculation proceeding away from the source (towards the planet in our case) in a step-wise manner. We operator split our radiative transfer calculation from the hydrodynamics and perform it between the "source" and "transport" steps of the standard zeus scheme. We consider only pure Hydrogen and the equations for ionization and energy due to this update are given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">dX dt = (1 − X)(Γ i + n e C H ) − Xn e α B<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_19">∂e ∂t = −P · u + Γ h − Λ<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where Γ i is the photoionization rate, C H is the collisional ionization rate, e is the internal energy of the gas, Γ h is the heating rate and Λ is the cooling rate. We include heating from photo-ionizations and cooling from recombination, collisional excitation, collisional ionization and free-free emission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Katz et al. 1996</ref>). However, we neglect heat transport due to conduction as it known to be sub-dominant by many orders of magnitude (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>). We follow ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mellema et al. 2006</ref>) and pre-tabulate the heating and ionization rates as a function of neutral hydrogen column density for our input spectrum, thereby capturing the nonmonochromatic nature of our problem. <ref type="bibr">Equations 21 &amp; 22</ref> are then solved explicitly by sub-cycling then on timescales which can be shorter than the hydrodynamic timestep. We note that our scheme requires that we resolve the ionization front, something we have enough resolution to do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Numerical setup</head><p>We perform a series of simulations in order to better understand the regimes which planetary evaporation exists in. Since a full exploration of the entire parameter space numerically is beyond the scope of this work, we instead choose to focus on low-mass planets (where evaporation is more evolutionary important -see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013)</ref>. In all simulations we use an underlying bolometrically heated atmosphere of 1000 K, which is forced to be isothermal by means of a temperature floor. We adopt a grid with 192 nonuniformly spaced cells with a resolution of ∼20 km at the base of the grid, and a radial extent from R p to 30 R p . The simulation is initiated with a neutral hydrostatic density structure for a 1000 K atmosphere. At the lower boundary the ghost cells are reset to the neutral, hydrostatic density and temperature structure every time-step. At the upper boundary we use standard outflow boundary conditions, which are perfect in 1D super-sonic outflow (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Stone &amp; Norman 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hayes et al. 2006</ref>, for their implementation in the zeus code). In order to choose the density at the inner boundary we set the density, such that the initial neutral hydrostatic atmosphere has an optical depth of τ = 100 to 13.6eV photons, which typically results in densities of order ∼ 10 −11 −10 −12 g cm −3 . We find that such a choice is sufficient to keep the inner regions of the active domain part of the bolometrically heated atmosphere rather than UV heated atmosphere. The domain is then irradiated by the UV and a transonic thermal wind is launched. In all cases the flow approaches steady-state and no variability is found. All results are analysed after ∼ 100 sound crossing times after steady-state is firmly established, with the mass-flux constant at the ∼ 10 −3 level (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>We perform two series of simulations: one at constant planet mass with a mass of 10 M ⊕ where we vary the planet radius and one set at constant radius of 3.14 R ⊕ where we vary the planet's mass. In both cases the radius/mass are varied such that the smallest/most massive planets have a density of 10 g cm −3 and the largest/least massive have at ratio of planet radius to the "Parker" radius 3 of 0.2. For each set we perform 24 for individual simulations at 12 different fluxes varying <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The "Parker" radius is the sonic radius of an isothermal flow, where we take the temperature of the underlying bolometrically between ∼ 10 and ∼ 10 6 erg s −1 cm −2 (where we take the EUV luminosity contained between 13.6 and 30eV). Our input spectrum was calculated by <ref type="bibr">Ercolano et al. (2009)</ref> and has been used in previous exoplanet evaporation studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> and extends out to several 100eV (although photons with high energies have an incredibly small photo-ionization cross-section with Hydrogen, σ ∝ E −3 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Results</head><p>As expected we identify two limiting flow types: recombination limited at high fluxes and energy limited at low fluxes. Note as discussed above "photon-limited" flow cannot be found for realistic parameters in 1D spherically symmetric simulations. We show the different flow topologies for recombination limited (top panels) and energy limited flow (bottom panels) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Both simulations are for a planet with a radius of 3.14 R ⊕ and mass of 6.25 M ⊕ . The recombination limited flow has a flux of 10 6 erg s −1 cm −2 and the energy limited flow has a flux of 10 3 erg s −1 cm −2 .</p><p>In the "recombination-limited" case (top panels), we see that the size of the ionization front is small compared to the planet's radius and the flow is fully ionized at large radius indicating recombination-ionization equilibrium. The temperature quickly reaches 10 4 K at the ionization front and the sonic point is very close to the planet's surface. Furthermore, we note that most of the heating is concentrated close to the planet's surface, as indicated by the heating rate profile (qr 3 -multiplied by r 3 to indicate the radius where the majority of heating takes place) shown in the bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>. We find that at these low masses the flow does adiabatically cool slightly at large radius although this is in the supersonic regime of the flow it doesn't affect the mass-loss rate when compared to the simple estimates presented above.</p><p>In the energy limited case (bottom panels), we find that the ionization front essentially encompasses the entire flow and the flow is still partly neutral at 10 planetary radii. This results in a much colder flow only reaching ∼ 5000 K at 2 planetary radii, before adiabatically cooling at large radii. This results in the sonic point being pushed to a larger radius. This flow topology is emphasised by the fact the heating rate peaks at larger radii than in the recombination limited case and is more spatially extended, as shown in the bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>.</p><p>We can investigate the transition between energylimited and recombination limited in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> where we plot the normalised mass-loss rate (where the mass-loss rate for all models is normalised such the mass-loss rate is unity at the lowest flux of ∼ 10 erg s −1 cm −2 ) against flux (top panel) and mass-loss rate divided by flux (bottom panel) for a planet with several different masses: 5.12, 6.25, 10.31, 13.92 M ⊕ (with a radius of 3.14 R ⊕ ). In the insert we show the logarithmic derivative of mass-loss rate with flux. At low fluxes the mass-loss rate scales linearly with flux following the dashed line as expected for energy limited flow; however, at large fluxes the mass-loss heated atmosphere and is given by: GMp/2c 2 s ; planets larger than this radius are not hydrostatically bound over evolutionary timescales.  rate scales approximately as the square root of flux (following the dotted lines), indicating recombination limited flow. We find that the transition point varies with mass and perhaps more interestingly the transition is slow, taking a large range in flux.The predicted transition fluxes from Section 2 -as indicated by the vertical lines in the insert of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> -pick out the end of the transition. As expected planets with higher masses become recombination limited at lower fluxes due to there increased flow-time scales.</p><p>We can see this transition in more detail if we plot the mass-loss rate as a function of flux for various planet masses, for the full simulated range of incident flux. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> with the 1/M p scaling for energy-limited flows shown as dotted lines. We find at low fluxes the simulation is well matched by an energy limited scaling; however, at higher fluxes the trend becomes much flatter indicating recombination limited flows (Noting that in this parameter range the planet's escape temperature is &lt; 10 4 K so mass plays a limited role as discussed above). The dashed line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the predicted analytic transition from recombination to energy limited flows. Above the line is predicted to be recombination limited and below is predicted to be energy limited. We see this prediction agrees well with  the numerical results.</p><p>Finally, in order to measure the efficiency of the flow we measure the mass-loss rate as a function of planet radius (due to its steep dependence this should provide a good range of mass-loss rates over which to tune this parameter). The discussion in Section 2 indicates that at low fluxes and low masses the flow should be strongly energy limited, which is indeed what we find. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> we show the mass-loss rate as a function of radius for a planet of mass 10 M ⊕ and fluxes of ∼ 10-100 (points). We find that an mass-loss rate with an energy efficiency of 20% agrees well with the simulations 4 and as such represents a suitable measure of the mass-loss efficiency in the region of parameter space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have argued that evaporation due to UV radiation can exist in three limiting cases: "recombination-limited" -where the flow is in radiative-recombination equilibrium and approximately isothermal at 10 4 K; "energy-limited" where incoming radiation is balanced by mechanical luminosity; and a new regime:"photon-limited" -where the mass-loss is limited by the fact that each ionizing photon can allow one hydrogen atom to escape. Each distinctive limit has a different scaling with planet mass, radius as well as the incident flux. We have shown that there is no unique transition flux from one regime to the other and such a limit depends on the planetary parameters.</p><p>Schematically if the flux is high enough such the the density in the flow is large (and correspondingly the recombination time is short) or the planet is so big or massive that the flow time-scale is long then the problem is in the radiative-recombination limited, where the recombination time is much faster than the flow-time-scale. As argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> in such a scenario it behaves as a HII region that is approximately isothermal and the density at the ionization front scales as J 1/2 0 , in this region the mass-loss rate (in a 1D calculation) is analytically tractable and we present such a calculation in Section 2.1.2.</p><p>If one decreases the flux, the density in the ionization front will drop and the recombination time will increase. Once it reaches the point where the recombination time is longer than the flow time-scale then recombinations can be ignored. When the recombination time is much longer than the flow time then we also find the cooling time is longer than the recombination time and subsequently the flow time-scale. In this case radiative cooling can be ignored. This is what one thinks off as standard "energy-limited" flow. However, we note that when the recombination time is of order the flow-time scale then the cooling time is shorter than the recombination time and thus shorter than the flow time-scale. Thus, one expects the transition from recombination to energy limited to happen smoothly and broadly over a large range of fluxes. This is indeed what our numerical calculations indicate, that the transition occurs over several orders of magnitude in flux. This is different to the case of X-ray heating discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref>, where since the heating and cooling times scaled identically with flux then the cooling time was always comparable or shorter than the flow time-scale. Thus, in the case of X-ray heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> argued that the flow was never "energy-limited".</p><p>If when one reaches the point where the recombination time is becoming longer than the flow time-scale and the planet is not tightly bound (such that the energy limit is not restrictive) then the mass-loss rate will be limited by the number of ionizing photons. Such that one can only lose one hydrogen atom per ionizing photon. Obviously, in this limit planet mass is completely irrelevant and the mass-loss rate just scales as the flux × area. Such a case is similar to the evaporation of low-mass neutral clumps by nearby young massive stars discussed which does not occur in spherically symmetric simulations.</p><p>by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bertoldi &amp; Mckee (1990)</ref>. However, this regime will only be restricted to a small (but perhaps important) regime of parameter space for low-mass large radii planets, similar to the masses and radii of the Kepler planets at young 10s Myr ages (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">, Owen &amp; Wu, 2013</ref>. Unfortunately, such a problem could not be investigated with realistic planet parameters in 1D spherically symmetric simulations. This is because such simulations assume spherical irradiation, in this case the absorbing area would be 4πR 2 IF . However, in the reality of planet-parallel irradiation and the fact the ionization front is marginally optically thin then we suspect the absorbing area is more likely ∼ πR 2 p . In this regime the ionization front is thick and by construction has a radius R IF R p and as such the "photon-limited" mass-loss rate from the simulations is much higher than reality and any other limit. One needs to perform 2/3D simulations to investigate the role of "photon-limited" mass-loss in planetary mass-loss.</p><p>Our numerical calculations indicate that the hydrodynamic efficiency if fairly low for low-mass planets ∼ 10 − 20 %, comparable to the values used in planetary evolution studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lopez et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013</ref> indicating that much of the absorbed energy remains as kinetic/thermal energy in the flow rather than being converted to mass-loss. When the flow transitions to energy or photon limited the ionization front is thick; essentially encompassing the entire the flow. Furthermore, we note that not all the heating is concentrated at the planet's surface as can be seen in the bottom panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, where the maximum temperature is reached at ∼ 2 planetary radii. The ionization fraction increases monotonically with radius but still contains a significant neutral fraction out to many planetary radii. Therefore simplified calculations assuming infinitesimally thin ionization fronts are not appropriate in this limit. This means photon hardening can play an important role in pre-heating material; this occurs when harder photons penetrate deeper than the standard ionizing (∼ 13.6 eV) photons resulting in an average photon energy that is harder than the total spectrum, these photons 'pre-heat' the underlying gas. Thus, one requires a non-monchromatic numerical method to take this into account (unlike Murray- <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Clay et al. 2009</ref>, who assume a spectrum with just 20 eV photons).</p><p>Finally, we note we have presented a new numerical algorithm for the inclusion of UV heating in planetary evaporation simulations. We have included the frequency dependence of the ionizing spectrum for pure Hydrogen atmospheres and note this can easily be extended to include more species ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Friedrich et al. 2012</ref>). Such an algorithm can be incorporated into multi-dimensional calculations that include ray-tracing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Owen &amp; Adams, 2014</ref>) to investigate planetary evaporation in 2/3D. Such a further step is important, not only to investigate the flow properties, in particular "photon-limited" evaporation identified here; but, also to produce realistic calculations that can be compared to observational indicators of planetary evaporation. This includes measured transits in Lyman-α ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Ben-Jaffel et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010</ref>) and other metal lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Ballester &amp; Ben-Jaffel 2015</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY</head><p>We have investigate planetary evaporation under the influence of irradiation by ionizing UV photons at close enough separations such that evaporation takes place in the hydrodynamic limit. We argue that there are three main evaporation limits. The first two were demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. (2009)</ref>, at high fluxes the flow is in radiative-recombination equilibrium and the mass-loss rate scales as the square-root of the ionizing flux; the second where recombinations are negligible and the mass-loss rate is limited by the amount of incoming energy and as such scales linearly with the ionizing flux. Finally, we argue that there is a third limiting factor that must be taken into account, which we term "photonlimited" mass-loss. In photon-limited mass-loss one can only lose a single hydrogen atom per incoming ionizing photon and is important when the planets gravity is weak (low density, low mass planets).</p><p>We present a basic physical picture of the three different evaporation regimes and show that transitions from one regime to another does not happen a specific UV flux, as assumed in some recent evolutionary studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jin et al. 2014</ref>). The different evaporation regimes dominate different planetary parameters and different flux and we present a framework that can be incorporated in to planet evolution studies, provided a mass-loss efficiency is chosen for the energy-limited flows.</p><p>We have presented a new numerical algorithm for performing radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that takes into account the frequency dependence of the irradiation spectrum. It does not require the ionization front to be thin, or approximately isothermal and self consistently finds the correct ionization and thermodynamic structure of the flow. This radiative transfer scheme has been incorporated into the zeus hydrodynamic code.</p><p>Using 1D spherically symmetric numerical simulations we have investigated the transition between "energylimited" flows and "recombination-limited" flows. We take into account the non-monochromatic nature of the ionizing photons unlike previous works (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray- Clay et al. 2009</ref>). The transition from recombination limited to energy limited occurs when the recombination time becomes longer than the flow time-scale and the ionization front encompasses the entire flow scale. In this case radiation hardening from the full spectrum is an important contribution to the thermodynamics.</p><p>We find that the transition from recombination limited to energy limited is broad and takes several orders of magnitude in flux. Planets with deeper potentials transition to energy-limited flows at higher fluxes consistent with our analytically expectations. Furthermore, we find that in the'energy-limited case efficiencies around 10-20% provide a good fit to mass-loss rates.</p><p>Finally, we could not use our 1D spherically symmetric simulations to investigate "photon-limited" flows and future mutli-dimensional calculations are required to investigate the importance of this type of flow. Something that is possible with our presented algorithm and we plan to incorporate this into the multi-dimensional ray-tracing scheme for planetary evaporation presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Owen &amp; Adams, (2014)</ref>.</p><p>We thank the two anonymous referees for constructive reports that improved the article.

The dashed line shows the scaling expected for a pure "energy" limited flow. The dotted line show lines propotional to the square root of flux, the scaling expected from recombination limited flows. The bottom panel shows the same mass-loss rates divided by flux (again scaled so that the ratio of mass-loss rate and flux is one at the lowest flux of ∼10 erg s −1 cm −2 . The insert shows the logarthmic derivative of mass-loss rate by flux at the different masses 5.12 (solid), 6.25 (dashed), 10.31 (dotted), 13.92 (dashed) M ⊕ , the vertical lines show the analytical parscription would predict the flow transitions from energy limited to recombination limited.</figDesc></figure>
