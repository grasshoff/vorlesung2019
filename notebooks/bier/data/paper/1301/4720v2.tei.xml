				<p>Using a new approach, we have obtained a formula for calculating the rotation period and radius of planets. In the ordinary gravitomagnetism the gravitational spin (S) orbit (L) coupling, L · S ∝ L 2 , while our model predicts that L · S ∝ m M L 2 , where M and m are the central and orbiting masses, respectively. Hence, planets during their evolution exchange L and S until they reach a final stability at which MS ∝ mL, or S ∝ m 2 v , where v is the orbital velocity of the planet. Rotational properties of our planetary system and exoplanets are in agreement with our predictions. The radius (R) and rotational period (D) of tidally locked planet at a distance a from its star, are related by, D 2 ∝ M m 3 R 3 and that R ∝ m M a.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Kepler's laws best describe the dynamics of our planetary system as regards to the orbital motion. However, Newton's law of gravitation provided the theoretical framework of these laws. In central potential the orbital angular momentum is conserved. In polar coordinates, the gravitational force consists of the ordinary attraction gravitational force and a repulsive centripetal force. The Newton's law of gravitation has been successful in many respect. However, this law fails to account for very minute gravitational effect like deflection of light by an intervening star, precession of the perihelion of the planetary orbit and the gravitational red-shift of light passing a differential gravitational potential.</p><p>Einstein's general theory of gravitation generalizes Newton's theory of gravitational to give a full account for all these observed gravitational phenomena. Einstein treats these phenomena as arising from the curvature of space. Hence, Einstein's theory has become now the only accepted theory of gravitation. The inclusion of energy and momentum of matter (mass) in question leads to the curvature of space, while the inclusion of spin leads to torsion in space. Einstein's theory deals with matter of the former case, while Einstein-Cartan deals with the latter case. Thus, Einstein space if torsion free. In classical electrodynamics the spin of a particle is a quantum effect with no classical analogue. However, the spin of a gravitating object (e.g., planets) is defined as a rotation of an object relative to its center of mass. This is expressed as S = Iω, where I and ω are the moment of inertia and angular velocity of the rotating object, respectively. The spin is generally a conserved quantity in physics. Besides the spin, an object (m) revolving at a distant r around a central mass (M) with speed v is described by its orbital angular momentum. This is defined as L = r × mm v.</p><p>This quantity is also conserved, except when an external torque is acting on the object.</p><p>In quantum mechanics, the spin and angular momentum of a fundamental particle are quantized. No such quantization is deemed to exist in gravitation. To incorporate quantum mechanics in gravitation we invoke a Planck-like constant characterizing every gravitational system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. This would facilitate a bridging to quantum gravity that has not yet been uniquely formulated so far.</p><p>The spin and orbital angular momentum may couple to each other as the case in the Earth-Moon system. Therefore, neither the spin nor the orbital angular momentum are separately conserved. Their sum is always conserved. A similar coupling occurs in atomic system. For instance, because of the spin of the electron such effect is found to be present in hydrogen-like atoms.</p><p>Owing to the existing similarities between gravitation and electromagnetism, some analogies were drawn which led to gravitomagnetism paradigm. It is believed that an effect occurring in electromagnetism will have its counter analogue in gravitomagnetism.</p><p>In this paper we formulate the proper spin-orbit coupling in a gravitational system, and then deduce a formula for the spin of a gravitating object. This is done by equating the spin-orbit coupling energy to the gravitomagnetic energy. The resulting equation relates the spin of a gravitating object to its orbital angular momentum. While in standard gravitomagnetism, the gravitational spin-orbit coupling,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L · S ∝ L 2 , in our model of gravitomagnetism one has L · S ∝ m M L 2 .</formula><p>This relation suggests a balance equation, mL ∼ MS. For this reason any orbiting object must spin in order to be dynamically stable.</p><p>So planets during their course of evolution exchange L and S, but eventually come to a state of stability. The bigger the planet the larger its spin. Hence, Jupiter spins faster than other planets in the solar system. Equivalently, the spin S ∝ Gm 2 v , where G is the gravitational constant, and v is the orbital velocity. This formula is found to be consistent when applied to our planetary system and exoplanetary system. Astronomers have discovered so far more than 800 new giants planets, but couldn't identify all of their radii and spin periods. The present formulation helps identify these latter properties. We consider here all possibilities to account for the observationally derived data pertaining to the exoplanetary system and their consistency.</p></div>

This minute difference between the two paradigms should be further explored. Notice that the inclusion of energy momentum tensor in Einstein relativity equations leads to the space curvature, whereas the inclusion of spin would lead to the space torsion. Einstein's general relativity respects the former but not the latter case. While Einstein attributed the precession of planets to the curvature of space, we ascribe it to the interaction of the spin of planets with the gravitomagnetic field induced by the Sun in the planet frame of reference.</p><p>Assuming the spin-orbit coupling as the one responsible for precession of perihelion of planetary orbits, the spin of a planet of mass m orbiting a star of mass M ′ can be obtained by equating eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(2)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(3)</ref>, i.e., spin-orbit interaction energy equals to gravitomagnetic energy, which yields</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S = α cos θ m M L ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where L is the orbital angular momentum of the orbiting planet</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 , α = 2g ′ s 3</formula><p>, θ is the angle between L and S directions, and M = (M ′ + m) †2 is the total mass of the system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure   1</ref>).

Hence, in an analogous manner when light passe near a central charge it will experience a redshift. This can be written as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">z = α Z λ C r</formula><p>, where λ C = mc is Compton wavelength of the electron. Now, when r = λ C , then z m = α Z. This case represents a maximal (quantum) redshift.

One can easily determine the orbital angular momentum of a planet. The spin of a planet however requires knowledge of the planet mass, radius, its rotation period and its mass distribution inside the planet.</p><p>Since some planets are solid (rocky) and other are gaseous, it is not easily to identify precisely their internal structure. The former ones have generally higher rotation rate than the latter. However, orbital periods of planets depend on their distance from the Sun and the Sun mass only.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and discussions</head><p>We consider here the planetary system, Jupiter satellites, and Saturn satellites. The constant C is calculated using eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(18)</ref> and Tabulated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref>. The average value of C are 0.089, 0.077, and 0.068, for Jupiter satellites, Saturn satellites, and planetary system, respectively. Notice that for exoplanet and asteroids the constant C takes the average values 7 and 0.5, respectively. The higher values of C for asteroids may be attributed to the uncertainty associated with the observational data related to them. Table6 can be used to identify exoplanets that are tidally locked by comparing the values of C, for a given system, with that of the Moon. Since our Moon is tidally locked, and well-known, we can consider C = 0.041 for tidally locked planets. With this value, we complete table 7. Assuming the exoplanetary system is similar to our planetary system, we suggest that C = 0.1, as evident from table 1.

This assumption yields spin values for the planetary systems that are in agreement with observations.
