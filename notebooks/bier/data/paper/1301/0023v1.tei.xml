			<abstract>
				<p>The Kepler space telescope has opened new vistas in exoplanet discovery space by revealing populations of Earth-sized planets that provide a new context for understanding planet formation. Approximately 70% of all stars in the Galaxy belong to the diminutive M dwarf class, several thousand of which lie within Kepler&apos;s field of view, and a large number of these targets show planet transit signals. The Kepler M dwarf sample has a characteristic mass of 0.5 M ⊙ representing a stellar population twice as common as Sun-like stars. Kepler-32 is a typical star in this sample that presents us with a rare opportunity: five planets transit this star giving us an expansive view of its architecture. All five planets of this compact system orbit their host star within a distance one third the size of Mercury&apos;s orbit with the innermost planet positioned a mere 4.3 stellar radii from the stellar photosphere. New observations limit possible false positive scenarios allowing us to validate the entire Kepler-32 system making it the richest known system of transiting planets around an M dwarf. Based on considerations of the stellar dust sublimation radius, a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, and the near period commensurability of three adjacent planets, we propose that the Kepler-32 planets formed at larger orbital radii and migrated inward to their present locations. The volatile content inferred for the Kepler-32 planets and order of magnitude estimates for the disk migration rates suggest these planets may have formed beyond the snow line and migrated in the presence of a gaseous disk. If true, this would place an upper limit on their formation time of ∼ 10 Myr. The Kepler-32 planets are representative of the full ensemble of planet candidates orbiting the Kepler M dwarfs for which we calculate an occurrence rate of 1.0 ± 0.1 planet per star. The formation of the Kepler-32 planets therefore offers a plausible blueprint for the formation of one of the largest known populations of planets in our Galaxy. Subject headings: planetary systems-methods: statistical-planets and satellites: formation-planets and satellites: detection-stars: individual (KID 9787239/KOI-952/Kepler-32) 1. BACKGROUND Before the discovery of exoplanets around main sequence stars two decades ago, models of planet formation were based on a solitary example: our own Solar System. Despite the discovery of hundreds, if not thousands of additional planets in the years since then, observational and theoretical efforts have focused on the formation of planets around Sun-like stars. However, the Sun is not a typical star. Seventy percent of stars in the Galaxy are dwarfs of the M spectral class (&quot;M dwarfs&quot; or &quot;red dwarfs,&quot; Bochanski et al. 2010), with masses that are only ∼ 10 − 50% the mass of the Sun, much cooler temperatures , and different evolutionary histories. These differences likely result in different formation and evolutionary histories for their planets. For example, both Doppler and transit surveys have revealed a paucity of gas gi</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Stellar Age</head><p>It is difficult to measure the age of field M dwarfs unassociated with known moving groups or clusters because their global stellar properties change little over the course of their main sequence lifetime. However, Kepler-32 has a slow rotation rate of P = 37.8 ± 1.2 days measured from the modulation of the light curve by star spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fabrycky et al. 2012a</ref>) implying that it is old. To estimate the age of Kepler-32 we use the age equation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes (2010)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t = τ k C ln P P 0 + k I 2τ P 2 − P 2 0 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The dimensionless constants k C = 0.646 days Myr −1 and k I = 452 Myr day −1 are determined observationally, the convection turnover time is estimated as τ = k I /2·f 2 (B− V ), where we use f (B − V ) = 0.77(B − V − 0.4) 0.6 (Barnes 2007) and (B − V ) = 1.5 (converted from g − r using <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jester et al. 2005</ref>) to give τ = 155 days. Using the median value of the initial spin period, P 0 = 2.81, as required to produce the observed rotation rates for ≈ 0. 3. VALIDATION OF TRANSIT SIGNALS Two of the Kepler-32 planets (b and c) have been validated previous to this study using signatures of their mutual dynamical interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fabrycky et al. 2012a</ref>). The other three transit signals have hitherto retained the status of planet candidates. The probabilities for Kepler planet candidates to be astrophysical false positives, such as blended stellar eclipsing binaries, are generally low <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Morton &amp; Johnson 2011)</ref>, and may even be negligible in multiply transiting systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>). Diffraction limited images in the Kepler band made with the Robo-AO system on the Palomar 60-inch telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baranec et al. 2012)</ref> show no evidence of blended companions for a 5 σ contrast of ∆z ≈ 3.5 at 0 ′′ .5 and ∆z ≈ 4.5 at 1 ′′ . High-resolution optical spectroscopy with the HIRES spectrograph on Keck I and high-resolution adaptive optics imaging in the near infrared using the NIRC2 camera on Keck II place stringent constrains on the probabilities of various false positive scenarios, allowing a probabilistic validation of the transit signals using the procedure of Morton (2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Keck I/HIRES Spectroscopy</head><p>We obtained spectra of Kepler-32 at Keck Observatory using the HIgh-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vogt et al. 1994</ref>) on Keck I with the standard observing setup used by the California Planet Survey ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. 2010b</ref>) which covers a wavelength range from 3640Å3640Å to 7820Å7820Å. Because of the star's faint visual magnitude we used the C2 decker corresponding to a projected size of 14 ′′ .0 × 0 ′′ .851 to allow sky subtraction and a resolving power of R = 55000. We obtained 2 observations of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32 (UT 18 June 2011 and</ref><ref type="bibr">UT 13 March 2012)</ref>, both with an exposure time of 700 seconds, each resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 at 6500Å6500Å.</p><p>To measure the systemic radial velocity of Kepler-32 and to check for evidence of a second set of stellar lines in the spectrum, we performed a cross-correlation analysis with respect to a HIRES spectrum of a similar star (HIP 86961: V rad = −28.9 ± 0.4 km s −1 ; <ref type="bibr">Nidever et al. 2002</ref>) using the methodology described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Johnson et al. (2010a)</ref>. Our analysis yields a systemic radial velocity of −32.5 ± 0.5 km s −1 . No second set of lines are evident above the noise floor in the cross-correlation function, allowing us to rule out stellar companions with V &gt; 10 km s −1 and V -band brightnesses within 2 magnitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Keck II/NIRC2 Adaptive Optics Imaging</head><p>We performed adaptive optics imaging using the NIRC2 instrument on the Keck II telescope on UT 24 June 2011 to rule out false positive scenarios involving blended sources. With a Kepler bandpass magnitude K P = 15.80, Kepler-32 is relatively faint for natural guide star observations. Nevertheless, we were able to close the adaptive optics (AO) system control loops on the star with a frame rate of 41 Hz. With sufficient counts in each wavefront sensor subaperture, a stable lock was maintained for the duration of the observations.  We acquired two sets of dithered images using the NIRC2 medium camera (plate scale = 20 mas pix −1 ) a sequence of 9 images in the J-filter (central wavelength = 1.25 µm), and a sequence of 9 images in the K ′ -filter (central wavelength = 2.12 µm). Each image had an exposure time of 20 s, resulting in a total on-source integration time of 180 s per filter. To process the data, hot pixels were removed, the sky-background was subtracted, and the images were aligned then coadded. We measured the contrast achieved by NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging by comparing the peak intensity of the star in the final processed image to the intensity of residual scattered starlight at small angular separations. Specifically, we calculate the standard deviation of flux, σ, within a box of size 3 × 3 FWHM, where FWHM is the point-spread function full-width at half-maximum spatial scale (also the size of a speckle). The standard deviation is evaluated at numerous locations close to the star and the results are azimuthally averaged to estimate the local radial contrast profile. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the 5 σ contrast curves based on each reduced AO image. The full instrument field of view is 20 ′′ × 20 ′′ , which corresponds to 5 Kepler pixels on a side.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Kepler Light Curves</head><p>Our light curve data come from the Kepler space telescope, which is conducting a continuous photometric monitoring campaign of a target field near the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. A 0.95-m aperture Schmidt telescope feeds a mosaic CCD photometer with a 10 • × 10 • field of view ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Koch et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. 2011b)</ref>. Data reduction and analysis is described by <ref type="bibr">Jenkins et al. (2010a,b)</ref> and photometric and astrometric data were made publicly available as part of the 28 July 2012 public data release. We downloaded the data from the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST), and we use the pipeline-corrected light curves from Quarters 0 through 9 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batalha et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>These light curves were aggressively detrended to take out all astrophysical variation by first masking out all transit signals and then sequentially fitting a low-order polynomial to the time series data in 2 day chunks. These detrended data were then folded for each Kepler-32 d, e and f with the other planet signals masked according to the ephemeris of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fabrycky et al. (2012a)</ref>. These folded transit signals were used for the FPP analysis. The binned photometric data are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> with the trapezoidal fits used to assess the transit shape overlaid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">False Positive Probability Analysis</head><p>To calculate the relative probabilities of astrophysical false positive and bona fide transiting planet scenarios, we follow the methodology of Morton (2012), which compares the observed transit shapes to those of simulated false positive populations, subject to the available observational constraints. Although occurrence rates may be as high as 10% for planets in the radius bins corresponding to KOI-952.03, .04, and .05 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Howard et al. 2012</ref>) we assume a very conservative occurrence rate of 1%. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> summarizes these FPP results for all three signals. Despite our conservative estimates of planet occurrence rate and without accounting for the fact that Kepler-32 b and c have already been confirmed to be coplanar transiting planets, which would further decrease the FPPs by a factor of about 10, we estimate the FFPs for KOI-952.03, .04, and .05 to all be less than 0.3%. We therefore consider all five photometric signals to be fully validated planet transits making Kepler-32 the richest known system of transiting planets around an M dwarf, and we assign the names Kepler-32 d, e, and f to the former candidates KOI-952.03, .04, and .05, respectively. Verification of the transit signals allows us to take full advantage of the fortuitous alignment of the Kepler-32 system with respect to our line of sight, and in the next section we look deeper into the details and implications of its specific configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">THE Kepler-32 PLANETARY SYSTEM</head><p>The increased accuracy with which we derive the stellar parameters for Kepler-32 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>) leads to more precise planetary parameters, which we outline in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>. The planets of Kepler-32 have radii that are similar to values found in the Solar System, from below Earth size up to about 70% of Neptune. However, the planetary system of Kepler-32 has a remarkably distinct dynamical architecture in comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the relative sizes of the planets and their orbits, along with labels denoting their periods, semimajor axes and period commensurabilities rounded to the nearest integer. The five planets of this system orbit within 0.13 AU from the star, or approximately one third of Mercury's semimajor axis. The outermost planet lies within a region where the stellar insolation is similar to Earth's, while at the other extreme, the innermost planet orbits only 4.3 stellar radii from the photosphere of Kepler-32. The three middle planets-termed e, b, and c in order of increasing semimajor axis-exhibit period ratios within 2% of a 1:2:3 commensurability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Tidal Evolution</head><p>The proximity of the Kepler-32 planets to their host star imply that their dynamics have been significantly  altered due to tidal forces induced by the host star over the age of the system. Using an initial spin period of 10 hours, a tidal dissipation factor of 100, a rigidity factor of 3 × 10 11 and a density profile similar to Earth such that the moment of inertia I ≈ 0.5 M p R 2 p , we derive the tidal locking timescales for the Kepler-32 planets to all be 1 Myr <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref>. This timescale depends linearly on the dissipation factor, Q, which is highly uncertain for exoplanets. However, for a reasonable range of Q values ranging up to 10 5 it can be expected that the rotation periods of all the planets in the Kepler-32 system are equal to their orbital period barring spin-orbit resonances.</p><p>Tidal forces from the host star will also damp the eccentricities of the planets in direct proportion to Q (Murray &amp; Dermott 2000). For Q &lt; 10 4 the inner planets will have no free (primordial) eccentricity. Though even for a low Q, the tidal damping time for Kepler-32 d, the most distant planet, is approximately 4 Gyr, comparable to the age of the system. The free eccentricities of Kepler-32 b and c have recently been estimated to have non-zero values from the phase of the TTV signals ( . This suggests high Q values for these planets, consistent with their moderate inferred densities (see § 4.2).</p><p>Contrary to the trend for Kepler pairs to lie longward of mean motion resonance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fabrycky et al. 2012b</ref>), Kepler-32 b and c lie 1.1% shortward of resonance. The high Q values suggested above would limit dissipative mechanisms that may spread their orbits <ref type="bibr">Batygin &amp; Morbidelli 2012)</ref>. Also Kepler-32 b is near a 2:1 resonance with Kepler-32 e. However, our n-body simulation of § 4.4 suggests planet e has too small an effect to account for these effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Mass and Density Estimates</head><p>As mentioned above, Kepler-32 b and c were validated based on the TTVs observed due to their mutual interactions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fabrycky et al. 2012a</ref>). The amplitude of the TTV signals specify upper limits to their masses of be 6.6 and 8.4 M ⊕ , implying densities of less than 3.4 and 5.7 g cm −3 for b and c respectively ( ). However, the TTV phases are measured to be ∼ 45 • from 0 and π implying a small free eccentricity. A correction for this effect by   The above stated densities imply that Kepler-32 b and c are composed of a significant amount of volatiles. Using Equations 7 and 8 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, we find that if Kepler-32 b and c had no atmospheres they would be expected to contain ∼ 96% and ∼ 56% volatiles. However, given the equilibrium temperatures of Kepler-32 b and c a large fraction of their volatile content likely exists in the form of an atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Atmospheric Evolution</head><p>The proximity of the Kepler-32 planets to their host star suggest significant atmospheric evolution due to evaporation, outgassing or both processes. The equi-librium temperature of Kepler-32 f is ∼ 1100 K and its radius is measured to be 0.81 R ⊕ . For a planet this small with such a high equilibrium temperature the atmospheric mass fraction would have to be very small, ∼ 10 −5 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>). Using an extreme ultraviolet luminosity of Kepler-32, L EUV ≈ 10 26.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hodgkin &amp; Pye 1994)</ref> and following Lecavelier Des Etangs (2007) using a conservative mass loss efficiency of ǫ UV = 0.1 we derive an atmospheric mass loss of ∼ 10 8 g s −1 . Thus the timescale to lose its atmosphere is more than 100 times shorter than the age of the Kepler-32 system. We therefore conclude the Kepler-32 f contains no atmosphere.</p><p>Given the size and equilibrium temperature of Kepler-32 e its atmospheric mass fraction must also be small, M a /M p ∼ 10 −4 while the present day atmospheric mass loss rate is between 10 7 and 10 8 g s −1 . The timescale for the complete loss of the Kepler-32 e atmosphere is calculated to be between 0.2 and 2 Gyr. Therefore Kepler-32 e must have lost a significant fraction of any atmosphere it started with.</p><p>The total atmospheric mass loss for the other three planets is at least ∼ 10 −4 M ⊕ for reasonable choices of planetary mass. If these planets have relatively lowdensity cores (ice and rock) and started out with large atmospheres, they could have suffered considerable atmospheric evolution due to the heating by <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32</ref>. Thus the observed sizes of the Kepler-32 planets are likely determined in part by the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray luminosity of their host star. However, the mass estimates from § 4.2 suggest that Kepler-32 b is 10% less massive than Kepler-32 c while being 10% larger and 25% closer to <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32</ref> hinting that the mass-radius relation for the Kepler-32 planets is not determined solely by a simple atmospheric evolution model.</p></div>

As mentioned above, three of the planets lie within 2% of a 1:2:3 period commensurability. Kepler-32 e and b have a period ratio of 2.038, which is 1.9% longward of commensurability, while Kepler-32 b and c have a period ratio of 1.483, or 1.1% shortward of commensurability.</p><p>Planets within a mean motion resonance can stray a few percent from commensurability and maintain the libration of resonant angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref>.

The occurrence of period ratios in our randomly drawn sample that lie within either the observed period ratio of Kepler-32 e and b, or b and c, is fairly high, 11% and 12%, respectively. However the fraction of systems arranged in a chain involving any combination of 1:2 or 2:3 near-commensurabilities is 1.9% ± 0.5%.

Assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 and a rocky core mass fraction of 50% implies that the protoplanetary nebula of Kepler-32 contained ≈ 3 M Jup of gas between 0.013 and 0.13 AU of the host star.</p><p>This translates to a very high surface density, ≈ 5 × 10 5 g cm −2 , in the inner regions of the disk that is incongruous with the masses and surface density profiles in the outer regions of disks as measured with (sub)-millimeter interferometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews &amp; Williams 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Isella et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews et al. 2009</ref>).

While the planetary embryos can undergo an additional phase of growth through subsequent mergers that increase their mass by an order of magnitude (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chambers &amp; Wetherill 1998)</ref>, it would be difficult to achieve an additional factor of ∼ 100 growth during this phase (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lissauer 2007)</ref>. The total amount of growth in this late phase growth is limited to the total amount of mass present in the disk at the outset, which is addressed in the previous section. The migration of planetesimals from outside this region also offers a possibility for late time growth of the Kepler-32 planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hansen &amp; Murray 2012)</ref>. However the gravitational stirring of the planetesimals can cause radial displacements of the planetary embryos away from period commensurability. The magnitude of this effect has recently been used to place limits on the amount of mass contained in orbit-crossing planetesimals at the end stages of planet formation for closely spaced, low inclination multi-planet Kepler systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Moore et al. 2012</ref>). These limits of ∼ 1 M ⊕ are too low to contribute significantly to the discrepancy between the isolation mass and the final mass of the Kepler-32 planets. This corroborates the above conclusions that the Kepler-32 protoplanetary disk either contained a disproportionately large amount of mass within 0.1 AU, or that the formation of the Kepler-32 planets followed a more complex formation and evolution history.</p></div>

But at small orbital radii the stellar irradiation raises the dust temperature beyond the sublimation point, clearing these regions of the raw materials for planet formation. Low-mass stars such as Kepler-32 begin pre-main sequence evolution with luminosities much larger than their main sequence values and take &gt; 10 Myr to contract to the point when hydrogen burning begins. The sublimation radius at these early epochs is thus further from the star than one would conclude from the presentday luminosity of the star.</p><p>The dust sublimation radius is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R sub = 0.034 1500 T sub 2 L ⋆ L ⊙ 2 + 1 ǫ<label>(3)</label></formula><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Isella et al. 2009</ref>) where T sub is the sublimation temperature of the dust, L ⋆ is the stellar luminosity, and ǫ is a measure of the cooling efficiency of the grains with larger grains having higher efficiencies leading to smaller sublimation radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Isella et al. 2006</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> shows the evolution of R sub as a function of pre-main sequence age of a 0.5 M ⊙ star based on the stellar evolution models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.4.">In Situ Formation vs. Formation then Migration</head><p>The above investigation into the structure of the Kepler-32 planetary system as well as the history and evolution of the host star present meaningful constraints on its formation. To form Kepler-32 f and e where we view them today requires that they formed from planetesimals scattered inward from the wider orbit planets. This kind of formation scenario would be different than the theory described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hansen &amp; Murray (2012)</ref> where scattered planetesimals accrete onto preexisting oligarchs from an early phase of planet formation. Rather Kepler-32 f and e would have had to have formed from scattered planetesimals in a region largely devoid of solid material. It is not clear how feasible this would be, and requires an investigation beyond the scope of this work. An additional challenge for in situ formation of the Kepler-32 planets is to explain the near period commensurabilities of Kepler-32 e, b and c with in situ formation that we have shown to be statistically significant beyond pure chance.</p><p>On the other hand, a scenario in which the Kepler-32 planets formed further out in the disk and then migrated to their present locations offers a natural explanation for 1) the large amount of planetary mass within 0.1 AU of this 0.54 M ⊙ star, 2) the position of Kepler-32 f within the dust sublimation radius of the star for ∼ 10 Myr of pre-main sequence evolution, and 3) the near period commensurabilities between three of the planets. The high volatile content inferred for Kepler-32 b and c is also indirect evidence that these planets may have acquired volatiles from beyond the snow line at ∼ 1 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref>. The difficulties in applying this concept lie in understanding the mechanisms of migration through a disk of gas and planetesimals. While a full, rigorous analysis of these possibilities is also beyond the scope of this article, we look to some order of magnitude calculations of different migration mechanisms for insight.</p><p>4.5.5. Migration The compact and coplanar architecture of the Kepler-32 system favors migration through a disk rather than through planet-planet interactions. Interactions with either a gaseous disk or a disk of planetesimals can cause radial migration of planetary orbits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kley &amp; Nelson 2012</ref>, for a review). Planets massive enough to open a gap in the protoplanetary disk are coupled to the viscous evolution of the disk while less massive planets migrate more quickly due to larger disk torques.</p><p>Using a generalized criterion for gap formation in a viscous disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Crida et al. 2006</ref>, Eq. 15) we find that none of the Kepler-32 planets would have opened a gap in their protoplanetary disk assuming a constant disk flaring term a/H = 0.05 where H is the scale height, a viscosity parameter α = 10 −3 and using the nominal masses for Kepler-32 b and c ( § 4.2) and M p ∝ R 2.06 p otherwise.

This disk model yields type . For these calculated rates, the timescale for these planets to have migrated from beyond the snow line at ∼ 1 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008)</ref> to their present day locations is short, τ mig ∼ 10 4 years, in comparison to typical disk lifetimes.</p><p>The increasing mass of the Kepler-32 planets as a function of semimajor axis naturally produces convergent migration for type I torques in a smooth disk, a necessary but not sufficient condition for resonant capture. To estimate the probability for resonant capture we perform an order of magnitude calculation comparing the resonance crossing times to the libration time for the resonances. The resonance widths and libration times are estimated using the pendulum model for an interior resonance <ref type="bibr">(Murray &amp; Dermott 2000, § 8.6-7)</ref>. For the 2:3 resonance of Kepler-32 b and c, the libration period is T lib ∼ 10 years and and the width is estimated to be ∆a res ∼ 0.009 AU using the mean eccentricity of Kepler-32 b from the simulations of § 4.4. With a convergence rate of 0.2 AU (10 4 yr) −1 we find that the resonance crossing time is roughly 40 libration periods. Following the same procedure for the 1:2 resonance of Kepler-32 e and b, we find that the resonance crossing is of order 10 libration periods.</p><p>Shallower surface density profiles produce slower convergence rates, increasing the probability of resonant capture while steeper profiles produce faster convergence, shortening resonance crossing times and decreasing the probability for capture. For γ = 1/2 we find that the resonance crossing times are on the order of 10 3 libration periods for both resonances and for γ = 3/2 these times are shortened to 1. The resonance crossing times in units of libration periods is a weakly increasing function of semimajor axis for our simple model, going as a</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1/4 p .</formula><p>Therefore we find that the Kepler-32 planets could have been captured into resonance while migrating through a gaseous disk if the surface density profile had γ 1, consistent with modern observations of protoplanetary disks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews et al. 2009</ref>). The probability for capture is a weak function of semimajor axis, and it is thus also feasible for the Kepler-32 planets to have been caught in resonance further out in the disk and have moved inward in lockstep (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cresswell &amp; Nelson 2008)</ref>. How the planets may have stopped their migration before falling onto the star remains an outstanding question in this scenario.</p><p>It is also possible that the Kepler-32 planets migrated through a planetesimal disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Levison et al. 2007</ref>) rather than the gas dominated disk required for type I migration. We calculate the order of magnitude rates for planetesimal migration using the equations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bromley &amp; Kenyon (2011)</ref> assuming a gas to dust ratio of 100 and that all solids are in the form of planetesimals. We find migration rates of da/dt ∼ −0.44, −1.1, −1.7, −2.1, −3.2AU (10 8 yr) −1 , roughly 4 orders of magnitude slower than type I. This slow migration rate would favor resonance capture and may circumvent the need for an efficient stopping mechanism. However, it may be difficult to migrate these planets in lock step from much further out in the disk as the inner planets could stir the planetesimal disk reducing the migration efficiency at that location for the next further out planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kirsh et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bromley &amp; Kenyon 2011</ref>). Also if Kepler-32 b and c were migrating at such slow rates, it is likely that they would have ended up in a 1:2 resonance rather than the more compact 2:3 resonance. These details may limit the distances over which planetesimal migration could have acted to produce the observed architecture of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32.</ref> From these analyses, migration through a gaseous disk produces a more favorable situation for transporting the Kepler-32 planets from far enough out in the disk to reconcile the difficulties with in situ formation outlined above. However, further investigation into the migration of multi-planet systems through both gas and planetesimal disks is needed to draw more definitive conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The analyses of the preceding sections provide evidence that the Kepler-32 planets formed further out in their protoplanetary disk from where we see them today and migrated convergently into their present locations. The high inferred volatile content of Kepler-32 b and c, and the order of magnitude calculations for the migration rates of the Kepler-32 planets suggest that these planets have formed beyond the snow line in the presence of gas.

This results in 5499 stars from the KIC catalog observed with Kepler, however there are only 4682 with finite, non-zero photometric precision values for at least one quarter between Q0 and Q6. Since the Kepler sample is magnitude limited, the sample is skewed toward the most massive M dwarfs, peaking around 0.5 M ⊙ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10)</ref>. Two giant planet candidates are present in this sample. One is a bona fide giant planet confirmed with radial velocity data <ref type="bibr">(KOI-254;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson et al. 2012</ref>). The other, KOI-1902, we found to be a false positive based on its transit profile. We scrutinized the light curves of several of the other apparent outliers by hand.

There are 48 single planet systems, 7 double planet systems, 7 three planet systems, 3 four planet systems, and 1 five planet system-Kepler-32. Therefore 18 systems or 27% of the M dwarf KOIs are multi-transit systems. The giant, KOI-254 is a single candidate system that constitutes 1% of all planets in the Kepler M dwarf sample and about 2% of all planet hosting M dwarfs. This planet is anomalous and we do not consider it as part of the ensemble hereafter.</p><p>The main distribution of M dwarf planets appears to follow a trend of increasing mass (radius) as a function of semimajor axis.

The detection limit for an observational baseline of 6 quarters and a SNR threshold of about 5 for a typical M1V star is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> as the dashed line.

Stars with masses characteristic of the Kepler M dwarf sample are a factor of ∼ 1.8 times more common than stars of 1 M ⊙ (Chabrier 2003), and the planets of the Kepler-32 system are representative of the planets that form around these stars. Therefore the insights gleaned from the Kepler-32 system both show us where to look for additional planets in the Solar Neighborhood, and provide a template for understanding the formation of the ubiquitous compact planetary systems throughout the Galaxy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Summary and Future Directions</head><p>We present a detailed analysis of the Kepler-32 planetary system which offers the rare circumstance of 5 transit signals. While two of the planets have been previously validated through evidence of their mutual gravitational interactions, we validate the remaining three transit signals probabilistically using observations from the W. M.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Keck Observatory as constraints. This validation makes</head><p>Kepler-32 the richest system of transiting planets known around an M dwarf.</p><p>Kepler-32 has a markedly compact architecture. All five planets orbit within one third of Mercury's distance from the Sun, with the closest planet orbiting only 4.3 stellar radii from the Kepler-32 photosphere. The three middle planets lie close to a 1:2:3 period commensurability that is unlikely to be the result of chance.</p><p>Our refined stellar parameters improve the derived planetary characteristics, and aid in reconstructing this system's formation history. Several pieces of evidence from our analyses indicate that the Kepler-32 planets did not form where we see them today:</p><p>• the dust sublimation radius of Kepler-32 lying outside the present day semimajor axis of Kepler-32 f for longer than a typical protostellar disk lifetime</p><p>• the extremely high surface densities inferred by assuming in situ formation</p><p>• the limited range of gravitational influence for planetary embryos located so close to their host star</p><p>• the unlikely arrangement of three planets in the system near a 1:2:3 period commensurability</p><p>• the high volatile content of Kepler-32 b and c.</p><p>This conclusion necessitates planet migration through a disk, and our order of magnitude calculations for the migration rates of the Kepler-32 planets embedded in a typical protostellar disk suggest the presence of gas. If true, this would limit the formation time of the Kepler-32 planets to 10 Myr-the known timescales over which gaseous disks survive.</p><p>Kepler-32 is found to be representative of the full sample of 66 Kepler M dwarf host stars, and the Kepler-32 planets span the mid-line of the distribution of 100 Kepler M dwarf planet candidates in radius-semimajor axis space. Although we are unable to treat each system in this ensemble with the same care as for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32, we</ref> show that similar analyses applied to the ensemble give consistent results to those derived for Kepler-32. Thus the formation scenario deduced from Kepler-32 offers a plausible blueprint for the formation of the full sample of Kepler M dwarf planets.</p><p>We select out 4682 M dwarfs from the Kepler Input Catalog that have been observed with Kepler and use their observational parameters to derive the planet occurrence rate of Kepler M dwarf planet candidates. We confirm that within the completeness limits of the first 6 quarters of Kepler data, the M dwarf planet candidates have an occurrence rate about 3 times that of solar-type stars, while the occurrence rate of all candidates around M dwarfs is 1.0 ± 0.1. We expect the fidelity of our culled sample to be above 90%. Thus the compact systems of planets around the Kepler M dwarf sample are a major population of planets throughout the Galaxy amplifying the significance of the insights gleaned from <ref type="bibr">Kepler-32.</ref> At the time of this writing, there are only 37 planets confirmed to exist around 24 M dwarfs in the Galaxy (exoplanets.org, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Wright et al. 2011</ref>). The Kepler space telescope has revealed 100 planet candidates around 66 M dwarfs from which we draw our statistics. It would be of great benefit to the study of M dwarf planet formation to explore and validate a larger statistical sample of M dwarfs such that comparisons can be drawn against the detailed analyses of solar-type stars (e.g., Youdin 2011). The continued monitoring of the current sample is also important as this will reveal trends in planet occurrence as a function of orbital period for the smallest planets.</p><p>Mass measurements of the growing numbers of confirmed M dwarf planets will also play an important role in interpreting their origins. This can be achieved with nearby M dwarfs using precision radial velocity measurements, or by using alternative techniques such the amplitude of transit timing variations.</p><p>Lastly, direct imaging of the inner few AU of nearby protostellar disks will be possible in multiple wavebands with the Atacama Large Telescope Array (ALMA). The modeling of this emission may be the most direct way to constrain where in the protoplanetary disk compact planetary systems form.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-J and K ′ band contrast curves derived from our Keck II/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging constrain false positive scenarios involving blended sources.</figDesc></figure>

We now investigate what can be learned about the formation of the Kepler-32 planets by looking backward from their end state. 4.5.1. The Kepler-32 Protoplanetary Nebula Planets form from flattened disks of dust and gas cir- culating around protostars, and the masses and sizes of these protoplanetary disks as well as their lifetimes and accretion rates are constrained from observations (see Williams &amp; Cieza 2011). The surface density profiles are typically assumed to follow a power law form Σ d ∝ a −γ . (Note: Here and throughout we use a to denote both the orbital radius of circumstellar material and the semima- jor axis of the planets. The Kepler planets typically have low eccentricities (Wu &amp; Lithwick 2012) minimizing am- biguity.)</figDesc></figure>
