			<abstract>
				<p>In this work we have performed a series of simulations of the atmosphere of GJ 1214b assuming different metallicities using the Met Office Unified Model (UM). The UM is a general circulation model (GCM) that solves the deep, non-hydrostatic equations of motion and uses a flexible and accurate radiative transfer scheme, based on the two-stream and correlated-k approximations, to calculate the heating rates. In this work we consistently couple a well-tested Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to solve for the chemical equilibrium abundances locally in each grid cell for a general set of elemental abundances, further improving the flexibility and accuracy of the model. As the metallicity of the atmosphere is increased we find significant changes in the dynamical and thermal structure, with subsequent implications for the simulated phase curve. The trends that we find are qualitatively consistent with previous works, though with quantitative differences. We investigate in detail the effect of increasing the metallicity by splitting the mechanism into constituents, involving the mean molecular weight, the heat capacity and the opacities. We find the opacity effect to be the dominant mechanism in altering the circulation and thermal structure. This result highlights the importance of accurately computing the opacities and radiative transfer in 3D GCMs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The precise elemental composition of exoplanetary atmospheres is a highly unconstrained quantity and likely depends on several factors. These factors include the composition of the initial material from which the planetary system formed, the local conditions in the proto-planetary disc at the time of planetary formation, subsequent migration through the disc and later evolution due to deposition of material by meteorites or evaporation of the atmosphere (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Madhusudhan et al. 2016</ref>, for a review).</p><p>The abundances of the individual elements (H, O, C, N, K, Li etc) fundamentally determine the overall chemical composition of the atmosphere, while the local pressure and temperature determine the distribution of the elements across all the possible chemical species (CH 4 , CO, H 2 O, Na, LiH etc) in chemical equilibrium. In turn the composition affects the temperature structure through the opacities and heating rates. Non-equilibrium processes (transport and photochemistry) also have an influence on the chemical composition and thereby the temperature <ref type="bibr">(Drum- mond et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Given the uncertainty in the elemental composition of exoplanetary atmospheres several studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kreidberg et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Madhusudhan et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wakeford et al. 2017</ref>) attempt to fit for the abundances of certain strongly absorbing chemical species, such as H 2 O, from observations which, for example, might provide a constraint on the oxygen abundance. However, such measurements are likely degenerate with other factors such as the temperature of the atmosphere and non-equilibrium processes.</p><p>Alternatively, several theoretical studies ( <ref type="bibr">Moses et al. 2013a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agúndez et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Venot et al. 2014</ref>; Menou 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kataria et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>) have explored the parameter space by performing a range of simulations that vary the elemental composition and investigated the effect on the atmosphere properties, such as the temperature, wind velocities, chemical composition and simulated transmission and emission spectra.</p><p>To date the focus has largely involved varying either the metallicity or the carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O). In the former case the abundances of all elements heavier than H and He are typically scaled uniformly, meaning that the ratios between the heavy elements (e.g. C/O, C/N, O/N, amongst others) remain constant, usually at solar values. Other studies have focused on C/O, where the abundance of C (or O) is varied for a fixed abundance of O (or C). This quantity has particular interest as it is thought that C/O varies radially in the protoplanetary disc due to the progressive condensation of H 2 O, CO 2 and CO, depending on the thermodynamical conditions (snow lines), thereby depleting the gas-phase O and C (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Öberg et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Madhusudhan 2012</ref>). The formation mechanism and location, and subsequent migration and accretion of gas and dust, may therefore determine the C/O of the planetary atmosphere.</p><p>Since the formation history and subsequent evolution of the planet is likely to determine the elemental composition, it is important to understand how this is likely to affect the properties of the atmosphere. In this study we investigate how the metallicity affects the thermal structure, circulation and expected emission flux, for the specific case of the atmosphere of the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 1214b. While we choose to adopt parameters relevant to a particular planet, we expect the general trends that we find to be applicable to the wider population of warm, Neptune-mass exoplanets.</p><p>The planet GJ 1214b has been an object of intense study since its discovery ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Charbonneau et al. 2009</ref>). It is one of the few discovered sub-Neptune planets that has the potential to be characterised using current instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Miller-Ricci &amp; Fortney 2010</ref>) due to its orbit around a relatively bright and nearby M-dwarf. Efforts have been made in several published works to measure the transmission spectrum of the atmosphere which resulted in flat and featureless spectra using both ground-based ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bean et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bean et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Cross- field et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">de Mooij et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Wilson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cáceres et al. 2014</ref>) and space-based instruments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Désert et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berta et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fraine et al. 2013</ref>). The flat transmission spectrum was interpreted as being potentially due to thick clouds at low pressures that provide a grey absorption or, alternatively, due to an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight and therefore small scale height. In either case, a cloud-free solar composition atmosphere was effectively ruled out. Only <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Croll et al. (2011)</ref> found evidence of a non-flat spectrum with a significantly deeper transit depth at ∼ 2.15 µm than at ∼ 1.25 µm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kreidberg et al. (2014a)</ref> obtained a transmission spectrum with the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument (Hubble Space Telescope) that was able to confidently rule out a cloud-free atmosphere, as the measurements are expected to be of high enough precision to detect absorption features in a high mean molecular weight (cloud-free) atmosphere. While this result suggests that grey absorption due to clouds is responsible for the flat transmission spectrum the bulk composition of the atmosphere remains unconstrained, with both hydrogen-dominated and high mean molecular weight atmospheres being possible.</p><p>Various modelling efforts have investigated the atmosphere of GJ 1214b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Howe &amp; Burrows (2012)</ref> performed a series of 1D simulations assuming an isothermal atmosphere and an arbitrary composition of gas-phase species and haze species (sulphuric acid, Tholins etc). They found a bestfit to the available data to be a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with small scattering particles, though atmospheres dominated by other heavier molecules (H 2 O, N 2 ) could not be discounted. Miller-Ricci <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kempton et al. (2012)</ref> found the effects of photochemistry and vertical mixing on the transmission spectrum to be small since the important changes in the mole fractions of the chemical species occured above the region probed by transmission spectroscopy, using a 1D chemical kinetics model. The atmosphere of GJ 1214b has also been investigated with a number of General Circulation Models (GCMs) that simulate the 3D fluid flow of the atmosphere. Menou (2012) considered both a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere (with 1× and 30× solar metallicity), as well as an atmosphere entirely composed of H 2 O, using the Intermediate General Circulation Model (IGCM) that adopts a double-grey radiative transfer scheme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kataria et al. (2014)</ref> also investigated hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (with 1×, 30× and 50× solar metallicity), as well as atmospheres dominated by H 2 O and/or CO 2 , with the SPARC/MITgcm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2009</ref>) that includes a non-grey radiative transfer scheme. Finally <ref type="bibr">Charnay et al. (2015a,b)</ref> used the Generic LMDZ GCM to simulate hydrogen-dominated (1×, 10× and 100× solar metallicity) and H 2 O-dominated atmospheres also with a non-grey radiative transfer scheme. In each case, it was found that as the metallicity is increased the circulation transitions towards a state with a stronger equatorial jet and with an enhanced zonal temperature gradient (day-night temperature contrast).</p><p>Zhang &amp; Showman (2017) performed a series of simulations of a 'GJ 1214b-like' atmosphere with the MITgcm, with a Newtonian cooling scheme to represent the thermal evolution, adopting a range of bulk compositions. In particular they assumed the atmosphere to be entirely made of H 2 , He, CH 4 , H 2 O, CO, N 2 , O 2 or CO 2 . Using a fixed radiative equilibrium temperature profile the effect of varying the mean molecular weight, heat capacity and radiative timescale on the dynamics and thermal structure was investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhang &amp; Showman (2017)</ref> found that increasing the mean molecular weight generally leads to decreasing zonal wind velocities in the equatorial jet, with a more banded structure, and a larger day-night temperature contrast. Variations in the heat capacity were shown to be less important.</p><p>In this study we use the Met Office Unified Model (UM) to simulate the atmosphere of GJ 1214b assuming various metallicities. To achieve this we have recently coupled a Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to the UM that calculates the chemical composition in each grid cell for a general set of elemental abundances for the local pressure and temperature. This represents the first flexible equilibrium chemistry scheme consistently coupled to a GCM applied to exoplanets.</p></div>

The Unified Model (UM)</formula><p>The UM is a complex atmosphere model used for both short-term, small-scale numerical weather prediction and long-term, large-scale climate simulations, originally developed for applications to the Earth atmosphere. Recent works have extended the models application to hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr">Mayne et al. 2014a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mayne et al. 2017</ref>) and terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boutle et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A description of the model setup for hydrogendominated atmospheres can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayne et al. (2014a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. (2016</ref> of the major aspects of the current model and provide specific details of the simulations presented in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Dynamics</head><p>The most fundamental component of the UM is the dynamical core that solves for the fluid flow of the atmosphere. The latest version of the UM dynamical core, ENDGame, solves the non-hydrostatic deep-atmosphere equations of motion on a rotating sphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wood et al. 2014</ref>). In contrast, most other GCMs so far applied to exoplanet atmospheres solve the hydrostatic primitive equations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Menou &amp; Rauscher 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Thrastarson &amp; Cho 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Heng et al. 2011</ref>), that assume several approximations to simplify the equations. The details of these approximations, and their validity, are more fully described in <ref type="bibr">Mayne et al. (2014a,b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mayne et al. (2014a,b)</ref> performed a series of idealised tests to validate the application of the ENDGame dynamical core to solve for the 3D flow over long integration times. This included several tests under hot Jupiter conditions using a Newtonian cooling scheme to represent the thermal evolution of the atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayne et al. 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mayne et al. , 2017</ref>). In the current work we solve the 'full' equations of motion and do not invoke the various approximations that lead to the primitive equations. The UM uses a geometric height-based (altitude) grid in the vertical domain. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr">Mayne et al. (2014a,b)</ref> for a more complete description, however we repeat the equations below to highlight the role played by the heat capacity and the mean molecular weight, which both depend on the chemical composition.</p><p>The set of five equations solved by the dynamical core describe the conservation of momentum (one for each directional component) and the conservation of mass, in addition to the thermodynamic equation, which are closed by the equation of state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Du Dt = uv tan φ r − uw r + f v − f w − c P θ r cos φ ∂Π ∂λ + D(u)<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">Dv Dt = − u 2 tan φ r − vw r − uf − c P θ r ∂Π ∂φ + D(v)<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">δ Dw Dt = u 2 + v 2 r + uf − g(r) − c P θ ∂Π ∂r (3) Dρ Dt = −ρ 1 r cos φ ∂u ∂λ + 1 r cos φ ∂(v cos φ) ∂φ + 1 r 2 ∂(r 2 w) ∂r<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">Dθ Dt = Q Π + D(θ)<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">Π 1−κ κ = Rρθ P 0 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In the above, u, v and w are the wind velocity components in the longitudinal (λ), latitudinal (φ) and radial (r) directions, respectively. c P is the specific heat capacity, R is the specific gas constant, Q is the heating rate, D is the diffusion operator and κ is the ratio c P /R. δ is a switch (1 or 0) that enables a quasi-hydrostatic version of the equations. P 0 is a reference pressure, ρ is the density and g(r) is the height dependent gravity, g(r) = g p R p /r 2 , where g p and R p are the surface gravity and planetary radius, respectively. f and f are the Coriolis parameters, f = 2Ω sin φ and f = 2Ω cos φ, where Ω is the planetary rotation rate.</p><p>θ and Π are the potential temperature and Exner pressure, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">θ = T P 0 P R c P<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Π = P P 0 R c P = T θ .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The material derivitive is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D Dt = ∂ ∂t + u r cos φ ∂ ∂λ + v r ∂ ∂φ + w ∂ ∂r .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>We note that c P and R depend on the chemical composition and therefore on the assumed metallicity of the atmosphere. Both quantities that appear in the above equations are treated as globally constant (spatially-invariant) model parameters. We will return to discuss these parameters in a following section.</p><p>A vertical damping 'sponge' layer is applied to reduce the vertically propagating waves that result from the rigid boundaries of the model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayne et al. 2014a</ref>). The magnitude of the damping coefficient R w is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">R w =      C sin 2 1 2 π (η − η s ) 1.0 1.0−ηs , η ≥ η s 0, η &lt; η s (10)</formula><p>where C is a coefficient, η is a non-dimensional height and η s is the start height for the damping. In previous works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayne et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. 2016</ref>) η was set to be a horizontally uniform function of height z,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">η = z z top ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where z top is the height of the top of the atmosphere. Here we adopt a formulation of η that is also a function of latitude,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">η(φ) = z z top cos(φ) + (1 − cos(φ)),<label>(12)</label></formula><p>that effectively increases the vertical extent of the sponge in the polar regions.</p><p>To demonstrate the shape of the vertical damping profile we show the value of R w as a function of altitude and latitude in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for one of our simulations. While the height z at which the vertical damping begins changes for each simulation, due to differing height grids (see Section 2.3), the damping starts at approximately the same pressure level. We note that varying the vertical damping has a small effect on the atmospheric flow (Mayne et al. 2014a,b).</p></div>

SOCRATES, which takes the two-stream approximation and treats opacities using the correlated-k method, has been adapted to hot Jupiter-like conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amundsen et al. , 2017</ref>. The UM including full radiative transfer calculations has previously been applied to the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>In the correlated-k method, the line-by-line opacities are approximated by a smaller number of k-coefficients to improve the computational efficiency. We have used the same k-coefficients as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. ( , 2016</ref> and we refer the reader to that work for further details on the calculation of the k-coefficients and sources of the line-lists. The kcoefficients of the individual gases (H 2 O, CH 4 etc) are combined on-the-fly in the model using the method of equivalent extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Edwards 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amundsen et al. 2017</ref>) which requires the mole fractions of the opacity species.</p><p>The k-coefficients used here were originally tested under hot Jupiter-like conditions and irradiation due to a HD 209458b star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014</ref>). To test the accuracy for the temperature and composition conditions explored in this work we compared the heating rates derived from a calculation assuming the correlated-k method with a calculation using the full line-by-line method. We found errors in the heating rate to be 10%, similar to the errors found for hot Jupiter-like conditions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Amundsen et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amundsen et al. , 2017</ref>.</p><p>During the main model integration the radiative transfer scheme splits the spectrum into 32 radiative bands. However, following the main model integration we restart the model and integrate for several planetary orbits using a higher spectral resolution (500 bands) in order to calculate the spectral emission from the top of the atmosphere, as detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boutle et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>The divergence of the radiative flux across each grid cell is converted into a heating rate (in K s −1 ) using the heat capacity of the gas. In contrast to c P that appears in the set of equations solved by the dynamical core (Section 2.1.1) the heat capacity here can be calculated locally in each grid cell. We therefore carefully distinguish between the heat capacity that appears in Eqs. (1) to (6) that we call c P,dyn with the heat capacity used to compute the heating rate that we call c P,rad .

This scheme provides a highly computationally efficient means of calculating the mole fractions of CO, CH 4 , H 2 O, NH 3 and N 2 under the assumption of a hydrogendominated mixture with roughly solar abundances of the elements and high temperatures. In addition, the abundances of the alkali species were estimated by assuming that the monatomic species (Na, K etc) were present in their solar elemental abundances above some critical temperature, and had zero abundances below ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. 2016</ref>) due to conversion into alkali chlorides (NaCl, KCl etc) at cooler temperatures.</p><p>In this work we improve on this method by consistently coupling a Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to the UM to enable the calculation of the equilibrium mole fraction of a large number of chemical species in each model grid cell under a wide range of thermodynamical conditions and for a general set of elemental abundances. This scheme is more flexible than our previous method, as it can handle the chemistry of a much wider range of species, and is accurate for a significantly larger region of parameter space.</p><p>The Gibbs energy minimisation scheme has previously been described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Drummond et al.

It is possible to include equilibrium condensation in the calculation, however in the present work we assume a gas-phase only composition. The mole fractions are calculated independently in each model grid cell. We compute the abundances of 41 gas-phase species in total: H 2 , CO, H 2 O, O 2 CH 4 , CO 2 , N 2 , He, Ar, NH 2 , NH 3 , Na, NaH, NaOH, NaCl, K, KH, KOH, KCl, Cl, HCl, ClO, Cl 2 , Ti, TiO, V, VO, F, HF, Li, LiCl, LiH, LiF, Cs, CsCl, CsH, CsF, Rb, RbCl, RbH and RbF.</p><p>Our decision to neglect equilibrium condensation is likely to have some effect on the final calculated mole fractions of several species. In particular, the formation of silicates and other oxygen containing condensates at high pressures and temperatures is expected to reduce the oxygen abundance at lower pressures/temperatures (e.g. Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999). Some previous studies take this effect into account simply by reducing the oxygen abundance by ∼ 20% (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venot et al. 2012</ref>). However, the elemental abundance of exoplanet atmospheres is highly unconstrained and therefore here we simply adopt the solar elemental abundances and focus on the overall trend in the atmospheric properties as the metallicity varies.</p><p>In addition to potential effects on the oxygen abundance, the temperatures expected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214b lie around the condensation temperatures of various alkali species (e.g. Na 2 S, KCl). Therefore, the neglect of condensation may lead to overpredictions of the gas-phase abundance of some alkali species. However, these species primarily absorb in the optical wavelengths (λ &lt; 10 −6 m) and since GJ 1214 is a relatively cool star the peak in the irradiation spectrum lies towards longer wavelengths and we do not expect absorption due to the alkali species to have a major influence on the temperature profile. Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, typically orbit hotter stars and absorption at short wavelengths due to the alkali species has significant influence on the temperature structure.</p><p>We assume the solar elemental abundances of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caffau et al.

The metallicity fundamentally determines the mole fractions of the individual chemical species via the elemental abundances. The effect that this has on the atmosphere can be split into several mechanisms:</p><p>1. Dynamical : c p,dyn and R that appear in the equations solved by the dynamical core (Section 2.1.1) 2. Radiative heat capacity: the heat capacity c p,rad determines the temperature response of the atmosphere for a given heating rate 3. Opacities: the opacities control the magnitude and location of radiative absorption, emission and scattering and hence on the heating.</p><p>Previous studies (Menou 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kataria et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>) investigated the effect of varying all three (1-3) simultaneously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zhang &amp; Showman (2017)</ref>, on the other hand, considered the dynamical effect as well as varying the radiative timescale (effectively a parameterisation of the heating rates) (1-2) in isolation from the opacity effect.

For the R1, R10 and R100 simulations we compute the mole fractions of the set of chemical species in each grid cell for the set of elemental abundances consistent with 1×, 10× and 100× solar, respectively. These mole fractions are then used to compute both the opacities and c P,rad in each grid cell. On the other hand, for the D10 and D100 simulations we compute the mole fractions assuming solar elemental abundances, and compute the opacities and c P,rad from these. Finally, in the C10 and C100 simulations we also compute the opacities using mole fractions that are consistent with 1× solar metallicity, but set c P,rad = c P,dyn .</p><p>We do not consider higher metallicities as our current model assumes the atmosphere to be hydrogen-dominated. For 100× solar composition hydrogen and helium comprise ∼ 90% of the gas mixture (f H2 + f He ∼ 90%). For significantly larger metallicities the atmosphere is no longer hydrogen-dominated as molecules such as H 2 O and CO 2 become more abundant than H 2 and He ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moses et al. 2013a</ref>). In this case line-broadening due to additional species is required (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hedges &amp; Madhusudhan 2016)</ref>. This presents a challenge in terms of the availability of the data for the relevant pressures and temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fortney et al. 2016)</ref> as well as an increase in computational cost due to the addition of more opacity species.</p></div>

Since the coupled Gibbs energy minimisation scheme is significantly more computationally expensive than the previous methods it is desirable to perform the chemistry calculations less frequently.

We found that the R100 simulation failed in the early stages of the calculation, while the model is far from a steady-state, due to a transient numerical instability with rapidly oscillating features in the vertical wind field. The exact cause of this remains unclear but the features coincide with a sharp gradient in the H 2 O, CH 4 and CO mole fractions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref> illustrates such a feature) and may therefore be due to sharp vertical gradients in the heating rates. We found that adjusting the magnitude (C = 0.20), vertical extent (η s = 0.70) and shape (polar-dipped, rather than horizontally-uniform) of the sponge layer was sufficient to avoid this numerical instability. We do not expect this to significantly effect the resulting wind velocities ( <ref type="bibr">Mayne et al. 2014a,b)</ref>. Eventually the oscillations reduce, and do not reappear, as the model is integrated to longer times. For consistency we adopt the same sponge parameters for all simulations presented here.

As the metallicity is increased the dayside-average thermal profile shows an overall increase in temperature, a trend also seen in previous 1D models of hot exoplanet atmospheres (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agúndez et al. 2014b</ref>), due to increases in the overall atmospheric opacity.

As the metallicity increases the abundances of these species increases at the expense of H 2 and He. For the 100× solar case CO becomes more abundant than CH 4 for some pressures. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref> we show the abundances of CO 2 and HCN, to illustrate their increasing abundance with metallicity.

The high latitude regions are more than 100 K cooler than the equatorial regions, while the maximum zonal temperature difference is ∼ 50 K. The wind velocity vectors show a rather uniform eastward flow for most of the latitude range. The R10 and R100 simulations show the trend of a progressively warmer dayside and cooler nightside as the metallicity is increased. This results in a significantly larger zonal temperature gradient for R100 compared with R1. The location of the hot spot has also shifted westwards <ref type="bibr">(∼ 190 • )</ref>, closer to the sub-stellar point. A change is also apparent in the horizontal wind vectors with a more significant meridional (poleward) component for latitudes &gt; 50 • in R100, compared with the largely eastward flow in R1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The thermal structure</head><p>The D10 and D100 simulations allow us to isolate the dynamical effect from the radiative heat capacity and opacity effects. There is a negligible variation in temperature and horizontal wind vectors at 100 Pa between the simulations R1, D10 and D100. This test indicates a negligible impact of the dynamical effect on the thermal structure when the metallicity is varied between 1× and 100× solar.</p><p>We investigate the combined dynamical and radiative heat capacity effects in the C10 and C100 simulations. The effect of increasing the metallicity has a small impact on the thermal structure with a slight increase in the zonal temperature gradient. This indicates that the radiative heat capacity effect is more important than the dynamical effect, though less important than the opacity effect. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> shows temperature and horizontal wind velocity vectors at a deeper pressure level of 3000 Pa. At this pressure we find all simulations have no significant zonal temperature gradient with the largest temperature gradient occuring between the poles and the equator. This meridional temperature gradient increases significantly as the equatorial region becomes hotter as the metallicity is increased in the R10 and R100 simulations. The D10, D100, C10 and C100 show negligible difference with the R1 simulation at this pressure level. This demonstrates the much greater importance of the opacity effect over both the dynamical and radiative heat capacity effects. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref> shows a series of thermal profiles extracted from the 3D grid around the equator (φ = 0 • ) for a series of longitude points for the simulations R1, R10 and R100. The 1D ATMO thermal profiles used to initialise each 3D simulation are also shown. Generally we find that the temperature is uniform around the equator for P &gt; 10 3 Pa. For smaller pressures the zonal temperature gradient tends to increase with decreasing pressure. As the metallicity is increased (when included all three of the dynamical, heat capacity and opacity effects) the temperature of the dayside typically becomes warmer while the nightside becomes cooler, between 1 &lt; P &lt; 10 3 Pa.</p><p>The thermal profiles follow the 1D ATMO thermal profile reasonably closely for most of the pressure range. At low pressures the profiles sampled from the dayside are typically warmer than the 1D ATMO profile while the profiles sampled from the nightside are typically cooler. For high pressures P 10 6 Pa the UM thermal profiles follow the initial 1D ATMO profile almost exactly. As previously noted, at these pressures the dynamical and radiative timescales are very long and the results of the 3D simulation here are essentially set by the initial condition. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref> shows a series of thermal profiles extracted from a series of latitude points on the dayside (λ = 180 • ) and on the nightside (λ = 0 • ). Comparing with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>, it is apparent that the meridional temperature gradient is generally more significant than the zonal temperature gradient for GJ 1214b, for each of the R1, R10 and R100 simulations. In each case the variation in temperature with latitude remains significant down to a pressure of P ∼ 10 5 Pa. As the metallicity increases, the meridional temperature gradient increases across a broad range of pressures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref> shows the difference between the maximum and minimum latitudinally-averaged temperature for each simulation. The largest temperature difference occurs for the R100 simulation with ∆T ∼ 200 K at 100 Pa, followed by the R10 simulation with ∆T ∼ 100 K. The temperature difference for the D10 and D100 simulations does not change significantly compared with R1. The maximum zonal temperature is increased in C100 with ∆T ∼ 100 K at 100 Pa, compared to ∆T ∼ 25 K for R1.</p><p>The dayside average heating rates are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. The heating rates increase significantly in both R10 and R100 compared to R1, highlighting the importance of the opacity effect. In contrast, the heating rate increase is smaller for C100 and there is negligible change in the heating rates for D10, D100 and C10. These heating rate profiles are consistent with the changes in the thermal structure.</p><p>In summary, we find that as the metallicity is increased the combined result of the dynamical, radiative heat capacity and opacity effects is to increase the zonal temperature gradient, as the dayside becomes warmer and the nightside becomes cooler. In addition, the hot spot moves closer to the sub-stellar point as the metallicity increases. However, the dominant temperature gradient for the atmosphere of GJ 1214b is generally in the meridional rather than zonal direction.</p><p>We find that the opacity effect is much more important than both the dynamical and radiative heat capacity effects, and leads to the largest changes in the thermal structure as the metallicity is increased. The dynamical effect was found to have a negligible impact on the temperature. The radiative heat capacity effect produced similar results to the combined effect, with an increasing zonal temperature gradient, but to a smaller degree. The opacity effect was therefore found to be the most important factor in determining the thermal structure, as the metallicity is increased.  </p></div>

This is the zonal component of the wind averaged over all longitudes. We also perform a temporal average between 600 and 800 days; by 600 days the wind velocities for P 10 6 Pa have reached a steady-state. We note that the total axial angular momentum was conserved to within 99.9% for all simulations. The R1 simulation, with 1× solar metallicity, shows a large scale eastward (prograde) circulation across a wide latitude and pressure range with typical wind velocities of  The velocities in the equatorial jet increase significantly in the R10 simulation, compared to R1, with ¯ u ∼ 2400 m s −1 in the core of jet (the jet core being the region where ¯ u is a maximum). The zonal wind velocities at other latitudes outside the equatorial jet are similar to R1. In the R100 simulation, the wind velocities generally decrease, both within the jet and for higher latitudes, compared to R10. However, the jet penetrates to deeper pressure levels compared with both R1 and R10. The maximum equatorial wind velocities are ¯ u ∼ 2200 m s −1 in the R100 simulation. Generally, as the metallicity is increased, the atmosphere transitions from one with a large-scale eastward flow at solar metallicities to one with a dominant equatorial jet at 10 and 100× solar metallicity.</p><p>There is also some evolution in the zonal-mean zonal wind for the D10 and D100 simulation, considering only the dynamical effect. As the metallicity is increased ¯ u also increases within the equatorial jet, but decreases for higher latitudes. The latitudinal width of the equatorial jet appears to slightly decrease in the D100 simulation compared with the R1 simulation. When the radiative heat capacity effect is included, in addition to the dynamical effect, the impact of increasing the metallicity is larger. In the C100 simulation, the equatorial wind velocities are larger than in the D100 simulation. The vertical extent of the equatorial jet is also greater with the base of the jet reaching P ∼ 10 5 Pa, compared to P ∼ 10 4 Pa in the D100 simulation.</p></div>

Our results show that the radiative heat capacity effect has a small impact on the thermal structure, with the dayside becoming warmer and nightside becoming cooler as the metallicity is increased from 1× to 100× solar. In addition, the radiative heat capacity effect results in larger ¯ u in the equatorial jet. As the metallicity is increased c P,rad decreases resulting in a larger temperature response of the atmosphere to a given net energy change. A decrease in c P,rad therefore naturally leads to a warmer dayside and cooler nightside if all other parameters are similar. In addition, since it is the day-night temperature contrast that is suggested to drive the equatorial jet <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Showman &amp; Polvani 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mayne et al. 2017</ref>), an increase in the zonal temperature gradient leads to a larger ¯ u in the jet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3.">The opacity effect</head><p>As the metallicity of the atmosphere varies the most fundamental consequence is to change the mole fractions of the individual chemical species. The opacity effect is due to the varying abundances of the absorbing species. Our simulations show the opacity effect to be the most important of the three effects that we considered, leading to the largest changes in the dynamics and thermal structure as the metallicity is increased. The day-night temperature contrast increases significantly as the metallicity is increased from 1× to 100× solar. In turn, the increased zonal temperature gradient leads to changes in the circulation, which in our simulations generally results in a deeper and faster equatorial jet with weaker zonal-mean zonal winds at higher latitudes.</p><p>As the metallicity is increased the relative abundances of strongly absorbing gas-phase species such as H 2 O, CH 4 and CO increase, at the expense of H 2 and He. Overall, this increases the opacity of the atmosphere leading to shallower heating. Since the radiative timescale scales with the pressure (τ rad ∝ P ) the heating is occuring in a region with a faster radiative timescale and heat is less efficiently transported from the dayside to the nightside. Ultimately this results in a warmer dayside, cooler nightside and a hot spot that is closer to the sub-stellar point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4.">Mechanisms that affect the phase curve</head><p>Changes in the dynamics and thermal structure due to the dynamical, radiative heat capacity and opacity effects have an impact on the expected emission of the atmosphere. In particular, when including all three of the effects, the peak amplitude and phase offset change significantly in the 3.6 µm Spitzer/IRAC channel, with a smaller effect in 4.5 µm channel. Since the emission is strongly dependent on the temperature of the atmosphere at the photosphere this indicates a change in the temperature structure in that region.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> we show the contribution (or weighting) function (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Griffith et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Knutson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Drum- mond et al. 2016</ref>) for the 1× and 100× solar 1D ATMO simulations. The maximum of the contribution function can be used to estimate the pressure level of the photosphere P phot ,  from which the top of atmosphere flux originates from. We use these contribution functions to approximate P phot for each of the 3D simulations, which are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 4</ref> along with the corresponding altitude z phot . We estimate P phot for R1, R10 and R100 using the 1×, 10× and 100× solar metallicity ATMO results, respectively, while we use the 1× solar metallicity ATMO result for D10, D100, C10 and C100.</p><p>In the 3.6 µm channel P phot ∼ 10 3 Pa and P phot ∼ 10 2 Pa for the R1 and R100 simulations, respectively. Comparing these pressures with the thermal profiles of each simulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>) it is clear that at these pressure levels there is a significant zonal temperature gradient, with a maximum day-night temperature contrasts of ∼ 200 K in the R100 simulation. On the other hand, the emission in the 4.5 µm channel originates from deeper in the atmosphere with P phot ∼ 10 4 and P phot ∼ 10 3 for R1 and R100, respectively. For these pressure levels the zonal temperature gradient remains relatively small <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6</ref>) and we would expect smaller peak amplitudes in the emission phase curves.</p><p>The dynamical effect also has some impact on the emission of the atmosphere with F p /F s decreasing progressively from R1 to D100. As has been demonstrated previously (Section 3.1) the change in temperature between these simulations is negligible. However, the increase in mean molecular weight decreases the vertical scale height and the pressure decreases more rapidly with altitude. This is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref> where we show the pressure as a function of altitude for each simulation. Therefore, an emitting surface at a constant pressure level will correspond to a smaller altitude as the metallicity increases, due to the dynamical effect. The decrease in F p /F s from R1 to D100 is caused by a reduction in the surface area of the photosphere as z phot decreases with increasing metallicity, primarily due to the increasing mean molecular weight.</p><p>In general F p /F s depends on the ratio of the radius of the planetary photosphere (R phot ) and the stellar radius (R s ),</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">F p F s (λ) ∝ R phot (λ) R s 2 . (16)</formula><p>Since in our simulations F s and R s are constant we neglect them and rewrite Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(16)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">F p (λ) ∝ R p + z phot (λ) 2 , (17)</formula><p>where R p is the wavelength-independent radius of the bulk planet, and defines the radius at the bottom boundary of the model atmosphere, and z phot (λ) is the wavelengthdependent altitude of the photosphere. R p is constant for each of our simulations, while z phot depends on the composition and thermodynamic structure. Using Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(17)</ref> and the values of z phot in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 4</ref> we can estimate the expected change in F p /F s due to this mechanism. For example, the expected ratio of F p /F s between the R1 and D100 simulations at 4.5 µm is F D100 p /F R1 p ∼ 0.9. This is consistent with the difference between the R1 and D100 phase curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref>.</p><p>The measured R p of GJ 1214b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carter et al. 2011</ref>), from visible wavelength transit measurements, may be affected by the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, and the actual radius of the bulk planet may therefore actually differ to the value that we assume in our models. Uncertainty in this value may lead to quantitative differences in our simulation results, however, we do not expect it to affect our qualitative conclusions.</p><p>In addition to metallicity, the emission of the atmosphere can also be affected by gas-phase chemical kinetics. Transport-induced quenching and photochemistry can drive the chemistry out of local chemical equilibrium, thereby changing the opacity, thermal structure and emission of the atmosphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Line et al.

There are of course quantitative differences between the results of each model due to different levels of approximation and differences in model discretisation and numerical methods.

(2016)</ref> used a mixture of methods to compute the mole fractions of the chemical species in each grid cell. The abundances of H 2 O, CH 4 , CO, NH 3 and N 2 were determined using the analytical solution to chemical equilibrium derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref>. For the alkali species a simple parameterisation was adopted based on the chemical transformation curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burrows &amp; Sharp 1999, their</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) between the monatomic alkali species (e.g. Na) and the alkali chlorides (e.g. NaCl); for temperatures above the transformation curve the monatomic species was assumed to be present in its solar elemental abundance, with a zero abundance for temperatures below the curve.</p><p>An important assumption behind the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref> analytical formula is that all carbon is in CO and CH 4 , all oxygen is in H 2 O and CO and all nitrogen is in N 2 and NH 3 . This is a good assumption for near-solar compositions at high temperatures. However as the metallicity is increased other species can become important such as <ref type="bibr">HCN and CO 2 (Moses et al. 2013a</ref>) and this assumption breaks down.</p><p>Coupling a Gibbs energy minimisation scheme directly to the GCM allows for the calculation of the mole fraction of a much larger number of chemical species for a general mix of elements and for a wide range of pressures and temperatures. This has obvious benefits in terms of the flexibility of the model as we are no longer restricted to the assumptions of near-solar, high temperature conditions as in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows &amp; Sharp (1999)</ref> method. In theory, this also allows us to more accurately calculate the abundances of the alkali species by minimising the Gibbs energy instead of using simple parameterisations based on chemical transformation curves; this is likely to be inaccurate particularly for temperatures near to or below the curves. However, in the current study we chose to neglect condensation and assume a gas-phase only composition.</p><p>In general, the flexibility of the Gibbs energy minimisation approach is beneficial when adding new opacity species to the model, as the equilibrium chemistry of that species can easily be incorporated, provided the thermochemical data for the relevant species are available.</p><p>The main conclusion of this study is the importance of the opacities in determining the dynamical and thermal structure of the atmosphere. It is therefore crucial that the accuracy of the opacity calculation is maximised. Our model computes the opacity on-the-fly by combining the k-coefficients of the individual gases. This method is more flexible and can be more accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amundsen et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amundsen et al. , 2017</ref>) than the alternative method of pre-mixed kcoefficients used by other GCMs applied to exoplanet atmospheres (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kataria et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented results from a series of simulations of the atmosphere of GJ 1214b that assume a variety of metallicities using a GCM consistently coupled to a Gibbs energy minimisation scheme. Combined with the radiative transfer scheme that combines individual k-coefficients on-the-fly ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Amundsen et al. 2016)</ref>, by coupling the chemical equilibrium scheme we have increased the flexibility (more chemical species over a wider parameter space) and accuracy of the model. This development represents the first flexible equilibrium chemistry scheme consistently coupled to a GCM applied to exoplanets.</p><p>Our simulations show that as the metallicity is increased the zonal temperature gradient increases at low pressures, leading to a warmer dayside and cooler nightside. For higher pressures the zonal temperature gradient remains small but the equatorial regions heat up more than the high latitude regions leading to a larger meridional temperature gradient for higher metallicities.</p><p>For solar metallicities the zonal winds are characterised by a large-scale eastward flow at all latitudes. As the metallicity is increased the winds generally become faster in the equatorial region and slower at high latitudes, leading to a circulation pattern that is dominated by a fast equatorial jet.</p><p>These qualitative trends in the circulation and thermal structure with metallicity are consistent with results from previous works using different GCMs (Menou 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kataria et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>). There are quantitative differences in both the typical wind velocities and temperatures from each model. These quantitative discrepancies are likely due to a combination of different levels of approximation, differences in the model discretisation and choice of numerical methods and differences in the physical parameterisations (e.g. radiative transfer, chemistry). Understanding and quantifying these differences is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>We investigated the different mechanisms that lead to changes in the dynamics and thermal structure as the metallicity is increased, by separating the overall effect into the dynamical effect, the radiative heat capacity effect and the opacity effect. The opacity effect was found to be the dominant mechanism that leads to changes in both the atmospheric circulation and temperature.</p><p>Article number, page 17 of 19 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. main We calculated emission phase curves from each of the simulations. Our simulations show a significant effect on the 3.6 µm Spitzer/IRAC phase curve as the metallicity is increased from 1× to 100× solar. Specifically, the amplitude of the emission phase curve increases, as the day-night temperature contrast increases, and the peak of the phase curve shifts closer to the secondary eclipse. The signature of metallicity is smaller at 4.5 µm where the emission results from deeper layers of the atmosphere with an overall smaller zonal temperature gradient.</p><p>Coupling a Gibbs energy minimistion scheme directly to a GCM has benefits in both flexibility and accuracy. The mole fractions of a large number of chemical species can be computed from a general set of elemental abundances and for a wide range of thermodynamical conditions. The mole fractions can then be used to compute the total atmospheric opacity more accurately than using pre-mixed k-coefficients that assume a fixed chemical composition.</p><p>Equilibrium chemistry, however, has been shown to be a likely poor assumption even for hot gas-giant atmospheres. Physical processes, such as mixing and photochemistry, have been shown to drive the chemistry out of equilibrium using 1D (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Liang et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Line et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Moses et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Venot et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zahnle &amp; Marley 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Drum- mond et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tsai et al. 2017</ref>), psuedo-2D ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agúndez et al. 2014a</ref>) and simplified 3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cooper &amp; Showman 2006</ref>) models.
