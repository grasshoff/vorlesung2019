				<p>Short-period planets exhibit day-night temperature contrasts of hundreds to thousands of degrees K. They also exhibit eastward hotspot offsets whereby the hottest region on the planet is East of the substellar point 1 ; this has been widely interpreted as advection of heat due to eastward winds 2. We present thermal phase observations of the hot Jupiter CoRoT-2b obtained with the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. These measurements show the most robust detection to date of a westward hotspot offset of 23 ± 4 degrees, in contrast with the nine other planets with equivalent measurements 3-10. The peculiar infrared flux map of CoRoT-2b may result from westward winds due to non-synchronous rotation 11 or magnetic effects 12, 13 , or partial cloud coverage, that obscures the emergent flux from the planet&apos;s eastern hemisphere 14-17. Non-synchronous rotation and magnetic effects may also explain the planet&apos;s anomalously large radius 12, 18. On the other hand, partial cloud coverage could explain the featureless dayside emission spectrum of the planet 19, 20. If CoRoT-2b is not tidally locked, then it means that our understanding of star-planet tidal interaction is incomplete. If the westward offset is due to magnetic effects, our result represents an opportunity to study an exoplanet&apos;s magnetic field. If it has Eastern clouds, then it means that our understanding of large-scale circulation on tidally locked planets is incomplete. Main Text Amongst the plethora of known hot Jupiters, the CoRoT-2 system stands out from the rest for three reasons: its remarkably active host star, its unusual inflated radius, and its puzzling emission spectrum. In addition to these anomalous features, previous observations of the CoRoT-2 system show a gravitationally bound stellar companion candidate, 2MASS J19270636+0122577. CoRoT-2b&apos;s optical phase curve obtained by the CoRoT mission has previously been studied 21, 22 and yielded an upper limit on the planet&apos;s geometric albedo of 0.12. Later near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations, acquired with ground-based 23 and space-based 20, 24, 25 instruments , have shown that the planet&apos;s emission spectrum could not be explained by conventional solar composition spectra or by a blackbody. Several scenarios were invoked to interpret the perplexing spectrum including the presence of silicate clouds affecting the mid-IR emission of the planet 19 and optically thick dayside clouds or a vertically isothermal atmosphere to explain the lack of features in the data acquired by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 20. We present new phase observations of the CoRoT-2 system (PID 11073; PI Cowan) acquired with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope with the 4.5 Orbital Phase [(t-t 0 /P)] Figure 1. Fit model to Spitzer phase observation of CoRoT-2b. The top panel shows the normalized raw photometry obtained from Spitzer observations of the CoRoT-2 system (gray dots) and the fit with greatest Bayesian Evidence, instrumental systematics modeled as a 2 nd order polynomial and with no stellar variability (red dots). The error on the photometry measurements presented (top-left) is the photometric scatter, σ F , which is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The second panel shows the photometry corrected for detector systematics (gray dots) and the most probable astrophysical signal (red line). The third panel is a zoomed-in version of the second panel to better show the phase variation-we can see the peak of the phase variation occurring after the secondary eclipse. This corresponds to a westward offset of the brightest longitude on CoRoT-2b. The bottom panel shows the residuals obtained from subtracting the most probable astrophysical model from the corrected photometry (gray dots) and the binned residuals with a bin size of ∼ 1 hour (blue points) and the errorbars are the error on the mean of each bin. / µm channel on January 3-5, 2016. To minimize the impact of the visual companion in our analysis, we subtract it from our images. We combine the data into bins of 64 frames and detrend the lightcurve for detector systematics using various detrending strategies explained in more details in Methods. We experiment with various decorrelation methods and fit for both the astrophysical models and the time-correlated systematics simultaneously. Most importantly, we find that the phase curve exhibits a westward hotspot offset. The offset is detected regardless of the planetary phase variation model, with and without imposing priors on the phase variation coefficients, and using the trimmed and untrimmed data. Additionally, we find the westward offset to be robust to the different photometry extraction schemes. Our analysis shows a phase curve peak occurring 2.7 ± 0.4 hours after the time of secondary eclipse and a phase variation amplitude, from peak to trough, of (4.3 ± 0.2) × 10 −3. Using our observations, including two secondary eclipses and one transit, we measure a secondary eclipse depth, and transit depth of (4.3 ± 0.2) × 10 −3 and (2.87 ± 0.03) × 10 −2 , respectively (see Supplemetary Tables for the complete list of parameter values). We find a smaller eclipse depth than previously reported using channel 2 Spitzer IRAC data 24, 25. Our new measurement decreases the abnormally deep 4.5 µm planet-star contrast previously reported. Fitting the emission spectrum of the planet, we infer an optical geometric albedo of 0.08 ± 0.04, which is consistent with the published upper limit using CoRoT data 21, 22 .</p>

The westward hotspot offset of 23 ± 4 degrees we measure for CoRoT-2b in the mid-IR therefore makes it unique. We note that another westward offset has previously been observed for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-7b</ref> in optical Kepler data, attributed to reflected light from inhomogeneous clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">14</ref> . We derive the longitudinal 4.5 µm brightness map of CoRoT-2b shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>We derive the day-to-night heat recirculation efficiency, ε, and Bond albedo, A B , of CoRoT-2b using all existing transit and eclipse depths in the infrared along with our best fit phase amplitude and offset, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Given the young age of the system (100-300 Mya) and the inflated radius of CoRoT-2b, we expect the planet to experience internal heating from residual heat of formation or tidal heating, but this should be dwarfed by the external heating of the star. The ∼35% Bond albedo of CoRoT-2b shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is greater than its low optical geometric albedo of 12 ± 2 % 21, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">22</ref> , suggesting significant NIR albedo, as reported for other hot Jupiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">26</ref> . The day-night temperature contrast is greater than has been inferred for HD 209458b (a hot Jupiter with similar irradiation temperature), suggesting that CoRoT-2b is less effective at transporting heat to its nightside.</p><p>The emission spectrum of CoRoT-2b has been difficult to understand since no spectral model could fit all the data within the uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">20</ref> . Using our new measurement at 4.5 µm, along with published eclipse depth measurements at other wavelengths, we fit a toy model including thermal emission and reflected light shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>, described in Methods. The model with a geometric albedo of 0.12±0.02 and dayside effective temperature of 1693±17 K best fits the data with chi-squared per datum of 1.34.</p><p>Water vapor is expected in hot Jupiter' atmospheres and therefore we expect to see water absorption features in HST data as well as at 4.5 µm. However, these features are not apparent in the emission spectrum of CoRoT-2b which could mean one of two things: 1) wavelengths in and outside of H 2 O bands are probing the same pressure or 2) they are probing a vertically isothermal region of the atmosphere. For example, optically thick clouds would prevent deeper observations into the atmosphere and could be responsible for the absence of water absorption features <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">27</ref> . Alternatively, it would mean that infrared emission originates from a vertically isothermal layer of the atmosphere. Bond Albedo  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Energy budget of CoRoT-2b and other hot Jupiters. The 1σ confidence region for Bond albedo and day-to-night heat recirculation efficiency of CoRoT-2b and other hot Jupiters. The color of each region denotes the irradiation temperature. Given the day-night temperature difference, CoRoT-2b lies in the low-recirculation efficiency region.</p><p>Given that the irradiation temperature of CoRoT-2b is similar to that of HD 209458b, global circulation models predict an eastward hot spot shift, due to fast and broad equatorial jets at and near the photosphere 2 . We propose three possible explanations for the westward offset seen on CoRoT2b: 1) westward winds due to sub-synchronous rotation 11 , 2) westward winds due to magnetic effects 12, 13 , and/or 3) inhomogeneous clouds that are optically thick in the mid-IR <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[17]</ref> . In practice, these scenarios could be causally related, since spin rate affects wind direction 11 , and wind direction affects cloud patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">17</ref> .</p><p>We note that the planetary photometry for CoRoT-2b exhibits a broad minimum rather than the distinct trough near or before transit seen in other phase curves. Sub-synchronous rotation not only produce westward atmospheric circulation, but the entire wind and temperature pattern is different than the standard eastward-jet pattern. Simulation of HD 209458 b with sub-synchronous rotation also show a long minimum in the phase curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">28</ref> .</p><p>The high temperature of CoRoT-2b allows for collisional ionization of alkali metals in the atmosphere, hence creating a partially ionized atmosphere. The presence of a deep-seated magnetic field could create temporary directional winds causing atmospheric variability as seen on HAT-P-7b <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">29</ref> . We note that the host star is relatively young and spectrally active. CoRoT-2b is then subject to high X-ray and extreme ultraviolet flux (XUV) potentially leading to time-variable photo-ionization. While magnetism in the atmosphere of hot Jupiters is not yet understood, it is conceivable that the photoionization could also lead to time-variable coupling of the atmosphere with the magnetic dynamo of the planet. We estimate that the strength of the magnetic field needs to be B ∼ 230 G to produce significant westward winds (see Supplementary Information). A recent study <ref type="bibr">30</ref> found that some hot Jupiters with energetic interiors can have magnetic fields up to 250 G. Since an inflated radius suggests a high entropy interior, it is plausible that CoRoT-2b could have such a strong deep-seated magnetic field. Additionally, the coupling effect of magnetic drag can slow down wind speed 31 which could explain the low heat redistribution efficiency, as well as the broad minimum in the light curve.</p><p>It is well established that some hot Jupiters have inhomogeneous clouds which produce non-trivial reflected phase variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">14</ref> . As previously mentioned, Kepler-7b's optical phase curve exhibits a westward offset. Such observations can be caused by reflective clouds located west of the substellar meridian 16, 17 due to nightside clouds advected by the eastward jets. In contrast with Kepler-7b, CoRoT-2b whould have western cloud coverage which require different aerosol formation and transportation mechanisms.</p><p>The equilibrium temperature of CoRoT-2b of 1521 ± 18 K allows for MnS, Cr and MgSiO 3 clouds to form on the dayside hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">15</ref> . Inhomogeneous clouds covering the East and night side of the planet with particles large enough to block thermal emission at 4.5 µm could explain CoRoT-2b's unusual phase curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">27</ref> . Based on our current understanding, clouds tend to form on the cooler nightside hemisphere. Therefore, in the presence of westward winds, one would expect eastern cloud coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">16</ref> . Alternatively, photochemical hazes (produced on the dayside) coupled with standard eastward jets could result in aerosols located east of the substellar point <ref type="bibr">32</ref> . If inhomogeneous clouds are responsible for the shape of the phase curve, the dayside emission spectrum would be an average of a blackbody spectrum and a clear spectrum. This could explain why no spectral model, so far, could fit all the data within the errors <ref type="bibr">33</ref> . However, if this is the case, it is possible that phase curves of other planets are also sculpted by clouds.</p><p>All three options are attractive because they might also explain other features of the planet. Asynchronous rotation can lead to tidal heating which, if deposited deep enough, can prevent contraction, explaining the inflated radius of CoRoT2b <ref type="bibr">34</ref> . Magnetic effects are also attractive as they can explain the large temperature difference between the dayside and the nightside of the planet <ref type="bibr">31</ref> and the inflated radius <ref type="bibr">30</ref> . Partial cloud coverage is appealing because it may explain the anomalous dayside emission spectrum of the gas giant. It should be possible to distinguish between these scenarios with phase curve observations with wider spectral coverage including 4.5 µm, either with both Spitzer channels or JWST. Non-synchronous rotation should have an impact on the phase . Dayside emission spectrum of CoRoT-2b. Our secondary eclipse depth and error, obtained from our fit using an MCMC, is shown along with previous measurements from CoRoT observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">22</ref> , Spitzer data 25 , HST/WFC3 β results <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">20</ref> and ground-based NIR measurement with their respective uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">23</ref> . The black line is the 1693 ± 17 K toy model with a geometric albedo of 0.12 ± 0.02 and the black dots are the band-integrated eclipse depths (per-datum χ 2 = 1.34). curve at all wavelengths, while unusual cloud coverage may betray itself at short wavelengths dominated by reflected light or by spectral emission features. On the other hand, the circulation due to magnetic effects should be variable on an Alfvén timescale of τ A ∼ 23 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">29</ref> (see Methods for calculation), so a new phase curve at the same wavelength would show a different location for the peak.</p><p>The westward offset of CoRoT-2b is another example that hot Jupiters are not all cut from the same cloth and cannot be organized into a simple one-parameter family. More broadly, each scenario outlined above challenges our understanding of short period planets. If the westward hot spot offset is due to non-synchronous rotation, then our understanding of tidal interaction between planets and their host star is not fully understood. If magnetic effects are responsible for the unusual shape of the phase curve, our result would represent one of the few observable effects of a hot Jupiter's magnetic field, allowing further understanding of the magnetic fields of hot Jovians. Lastly, if it is caused by Eastern clouds, then our understanding of large-scale atmospheric circulation on tidally locked planets is incomplete. Hence, an exhaustive understanding of these phenomena is necessary for the characterization of short-period planets, including the potentially habitable variety. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source</head><p>We acquired observations of CoRoT-2b <ref type="bibr">35</ref> with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) 36 on the Spitzer Space Telescope <ref type="bibr">37</ref> with the 4.5 µm channel on January 3-5, 2016, during the Post-Cryogenic Mission. The system was observed for approximately 49 hours from shortly before a secondary eclipse to slightly after the next secondary eclipse. We used the subarray mode with 2.0 s exposures (1.92 s effective exposure time) to minimize the data volume and to make the observations as uniform as possible. This generated data cubes of 64 images with 32 × 32 pixel (39" × 39") dimensions. Our observations were divided into 5 Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs) and includes a total of 1374 data cubes covering the full orbit of CoRoT-2. We elect to discard the first and last AOR containing 12 and 4 data cubes, respectively, since they are dithered, placing the target on different pixels than the rest of the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Reduction</head><p>We convert the pixel intensity from MJy/str to electron counts and mask bad pixels, i.e., 4σ outliers and NaN pixels. We discard all frames with containing a bad pixel in the vicinity of the target. Observations of CoRoT-2 (K = 10.31) <ref type="bibr">38</ref> show the presence of a close-in visual companion, 2MASS J19270636+0122577 (K = 12.03) <ref type="bibr">39</ref> . Due to the proximity of the companion, we experiment with various photometric extraction schemes to remove contamination from the companion and choose the strategy resulting the smallest RMS scatter. We then bin the data into bins of 64 frames before fitting the data (see the Supplementary Information for details about the data reduction and photometry extraction).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stellar Model</head><p>CoRoT-2 is a young active star (100-300 Mya) <ref type="bibr">42</ref> with a rotational period P * of 4.522±0.024 days <ref type="bibr">43</ref> . Unfortunately, the CoRoT-2 system was not visible from Earth at the time of the Spitzer observation, so stellar activity could not be monitored in real time. Typically, stellar variation due to star spots should not have a large effect in the mid-infrared, but given that CoRoT-2b is an active star with a short rotational period, it would be unwise to ignore stellar variability. We use optical observations acquired by CoRoT 21 to estimate the magnitude of the stellar variation at 4.5µm on a 2 days time scale. We find that the stellar flux can vary by 1.1% (see Supplementary Information). We experiment with and without the inclusion of stellar variability to test the robustness of our fit.</p><p>The apparent stellar brightness is modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F * (t) = Φ * (t) + T (t)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Φ * (t) is the stellar variability and T (t), as mentioned before is the transit curve. This is modeled as a sinusoid with a period equal to the rotational period of the host star</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Φ * (t) = S 1 cos 2π(t) P * − S 2 (4)</formula><p>where S 1 and S 2 are the semi-amplitude and the offset of the phase stellar variation model included as free parameters, respectively. By construction, modeling the stellar variability as a sinusoid is not ideal for optimization purposes since this can lead to degeneracy between stellar and planetary model. In other words, both the phase variation model and the stellar variation model can mimic the shape of the planetary phase variation which explains the large uncertainty obtained for the fits which include a varying stellar brightness (see Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> and 5). Although a few fits including stellar variability yield eastward offsets, they can be ruled out based on their significantly lower Bayesian Evidence, as described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planetary Model</head><p>In the batman package, the time of secondary eclipse t e is not an explicit parameter, instead it is defined as the time when true anomaly equals 3π/2 − ω, where ω is the longitude of periastron. We did not account for the light travel time as it is only a matter on 28.04 seconds and does not affect our analysis.</p><p>The planet's flux is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F p (t) = Φ p (t) × E(t)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Φ p (t) is the phase variation and E(t) is the secondary eclipse. In the batman package, the eclipse E(t) is scaled such that the flux is unity during eclipse and the eclipse depth is given in terms of stellar flux. We re-scaled it such that E(t) = 0 during complete occulation and E(t) = δ e outside of eclipse. Previous studies have reported that the orbit of CoRoT-2b is nearly circular <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">35</ref> and therefore the phase variation of the planet's apparent brightness can be modeled <ref type="bibr">44</ref> to first order as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Φ p (t) = 1+A cos 2π(t − t e ) P − 1 +B sin 2π(t − t e ) P .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and to second order as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Φ p (t) = 1 + A cos 2π(t − t e ) P − 1 + B sin 2π(t − t e ) P +C cos 4π(t − t e ) P − 1 + D sin 4π(t − t e ) P<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where t e is the time of eclipse center. Note that Φ p (t e ) = 1, which allows us to make the eclipse depth δ e an explicit model variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detector Models</head><p>Photometric data obtained using Spitzer/IRAC exhibit a wellstudied instrumental effect due to intrapixel sensitivity variations <ref type="bibr">45</ref> . The total number of electron counts varies with small changes in the position of the PSF of the target on the detector. The measured flux variation is dependent on both the sensitivity variation across the detector and the shape and position of the PSF. We experiment with various methods to decorrelate the astrophysical signal from the detector sensitivity. Although the PSF spans many pixels, most of the flux falls in the core of the PSF. Ultimately, we ignore the effect of the PSF widths σ x and σ y on the photometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2D Polynomial</head><p>Our first approach to correct the intrapixel sensitivity variation is to model the detector systematics as a n th -degree polynomial in the centroid x 0 and y 0 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">˜ D(x 0 , y 0 ) = D 0 + n ∑ i=0 i ∑ j=0 c i j (x 0 − −x 0 ) j (y 0 − −y 0 ) i− j (8)</formula><p>where n is the order of the polynomial. The model has (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 parameters and we experiment with polynomials of orders varying from 2 to 5. The shortcoming of this model is the requirement of accurate PSF location on the detector. As mentioned before, binning data improves the precision of centroid measurements. As we do not expect the location of the PSF to change significantly in ∼ 2 minutes, it is sensible to bin the centroids by datacube.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLISS Mapping</head><p>In recent years, many researchers have used BiLinear Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping 46-48 . This non-parametric detector response model has the advantage of running quickly in a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) routine because the detector model has no explicit parameters. First, BLISS defines a set of locations on the pixel referred to as "knots". Then, it divides the astrophysical model from the light curve at each step of the MCMC and averages the residuals surrounding each knot to obtain the detector sensitivity at each location. Finally, it uses the sensitivity values at the knots to interpolate the detector sensitivity˜Dsensitivity˜ sensitivity˜D(x 0 , y 0 ) at each centroid. Again, the drawback of this method is the necessity for accurate centroid measurements: a greater number of knots requires more precise centroid measurements. To mitigate the problem, we used binned centroids to obtain the detector sensitivity. Due to the relation between the inter-knot distance and the requirements for precised PSF location measurements, we chose a distance between the knots to be approximately the size of the centroid scatter within a datacube.</p><p>The shortcoming of such non-parametric models is that they do not properly marginalize over the detector uncertainty <ref type="bibr">48</ref> and they have an indeterminate number of parameters which makes it difficult to assess the Bayesian evidence for the model as explained below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pixel-Level Decorrelation</head><p>Finally, we experiment with Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) 47, 49 using a modified version of the systematics model. As mentioned earlier, the PSF of the target spans many pixels. One can express the total flux measurements as a general function of the pixels level fluxes. Astrophysical variations are expected to affect all pixels equally. Therefore, variations in the fraction of the total measured by each pixel are caused / by the detector systematics such as variations in the telescope pointing, intra-pixel sensitivity variation, pixel coupling, and oscillation due to heating. Hence, one can express the detector sensitivity as a general function of the fraction to total flux recorded by each pixel.</p><p>We define the detector model as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˜ D t = N ∑ i=1 a i P t i ∑ N k P t k (9)</formula><p>where N is the number of pixels used, a i is the linear PLD coefficient for the i th pixel and P i is the value of the i th pixel. In contrast with the original formulation <ref type="bibr">49</ref> , we elect to include˜Dinclude˜ include˜D t as a multiplicative factor rather than an additive factor since it describes the detector systematics more accurately. The difference between including the systematics as an additive term or a multiplicative factor is the δ A(t) · δ ˜ D t cross-term which can be as large as 0.03 · 0.005 = 0.00015 (150 parts per million) for a 3% transit depth <ref type="bibr">50</ref> .</p><p>Although our observations were acquired in staring mode, the telescope pointing can drift significantly in long time series observations. In our case, the image position on the detector varied by a third of a pixel, hence the first order PLD performed poorly compared to other decorrelation methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Fitting and Error Estimates</head><p>To estimate model parameters and their uncertainties, we use the package emcee 51 , an Affine Invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in Python. We use parameters from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">35</ref> as an initial estimate of the astrophysical model. We use a Levenberg-Marquardt to estimate the detector coefficients from the residuals obtained after removing the initial astrophysical signal guess. We initialize 500 MCMC walkers with initial positions in parameter space distributed around the initial guess. We define the likelihood function as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ln L = − 1 2 χ 2 − N dat ln σ F (10)</formula><p>where σ F is the photometric uncertainty which we make a jump parameter, N dat is the number of data and χ 2 is the badness-of-fit which is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">χ 2 = ∑ i [F data (t) − F model (t)] 2 σ 2 F (11)</formula><p>where F data is the measured flux obtained from photometry.</p><p>Since the measured flux varies by at most 4%, we adopt the same photometric uncertainty σ F for the entire data set. Each fit has a different burn in period for the MCMC. To ensure that our MCMC fit has converged, it has to satisfy the following criteria: 1) over the last 2000 MCMC steps of all the walkers, the likelihood of the best fit did not change and 2) over the last 2000 MCMC steps of all the walkers, the distribution the MCMC walker along each parameters was approximately constant. We find that depending on the complexity of model, the burn in period is about 4000 to 15000 steps for each MCMC walker.</p><p>Instead of using a covariance matrix to estimate the uncertainty on our parameter estimates, we marginalize over all the walkers over the last 2000 MCMC steps to get a posterior distribution for each jump parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Priors</head><p>Our observations only include one orbit of CoRoT-2b which does not allow us to constrain astrophysical parameters such as the period, P, the semi-major axis, a, and the inclination, i, as precisely as values available in the literature. We therefore adopt informative priors for these parameters in the MCMC. We use the values and uncertainties obtained from 152 days of continuous observations of the system <ref type="bibr">35</ref> to impose Gaussian priors on a and i. Since the uncertainty on P is merely 0.0001% of the value, we choose to fix the period to reduce the number of jump parameters in our analysis.</p><p>The time of transit and secondary eclipse allows us to constrain e cos ω while the relative duration of the transit and the secondary eclipse allows us to constrain e sin ω 45 . While this puts a strong constrain on e cos ω, the duration of the occultations is usually too short to strongly constrain e sin ω. Since eccentricity can only range between 0 and 1 and ω can be any value, we put a uniform prior on e cos ω and e sin ω ranging from -1 to 1.</p><p>Additionally, we specify priors on the limb-darkening coefficient. We consider quadratic limb-darkening where the stellar intensity I(µ) is described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">I(µ)/I 0 = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ) 2<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where I 0 is the stellar intensity at the center of the disk, u 1 and u 2 are the limb-darkening coefficients and µ = √ 1 − r 2 with r defined as the distance from the center of the disc. The common way to deal with limb darkening coefficients is to estimate the limb darkening coefficients prior to the fit and keep them fixed. The drawback is that the coefficients are dependent on the stellar atmosphere model adopted <ref type="bibr">52</ref> . Alternatively, one can make the coefficients jump parameters which is more statistically robust as it makes no assumption about the star; we chose the latter solution and to ensure that we make no assumption about the intensity profile of the host star while never exploring unphysical solutions, we used the following parametrization 53 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">q 1 = (u 1 + u 2 ) 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">q 2 = 1 2(u 1 + u 2 ) ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>/ with uniform prior on q 1 and q 2 ranging from 0 to 1, which the author claims to yield both realistic and robust uncertainties. Most importantly, the full orbit phase curve of the system allows us to obtain a longitudinal surface brightness map of the planet <ref type="bibr">44</ref> . We use a physical prior rejecting models with phase variation coefficients that yield negative brightness at any longitude 54 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparison</head><p>Generally, a fit to data improves as we increase the number of model parameters. To compare the various astrophysical and detector models, we estimate the Bayesian Evidence by analogy with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) <ref type="bibr">55,</ref><ref type="bibr">56</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E = ln L − N par 2 ln N dat = − BIC 2 (15)</formula><p>where N par is the number of model parameters. By this definition, a greater Bayesian evidence is preferred.</p><p>We experiment with various models: different detector models, planetary signature models, and the inclusion of stellar variabilty signatures. Although BLISS mapping is a non-parameteric model and therefore cannot be assigned a Bayesian Evidence, those fits yield lower log-likelihood than polynomials and therefore were ruled out as best fits. Comparing the Bayesian Evidence, we find 3 almost equivalently best models and 2 substantially good models 57 :</p><p>• no stellar variability, 2 nd order polynomial detector model, 2 nd order phase variation, E = 7695.64 (∆BIC = 0)</p><p>• with stellar variability, 3 th order polynomial detector model, 1 st order phase variation, E = 7695.14 (∆BIC = 1.00)</p><p>• with stellar variability, 4 th order polynomial detector model, 1 st order phase variation, E = 7694.62 (∆BIC = 2.04)</p><p>• with stellar variability, 2 nd order polynomial detector model, 2 st order phase variation, E = 7693.52 (∆BIC = 4.24)</p><p>• with stellar variability, 2 nd order polynomial detector model, 1 st order phase variation, E = 7693.49</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(∆BIC = 4.30)</formula><p>where ∆BIC is the difference in BIC compared to the fit with lowest BIC, and by analogy with greatest Bayesian Evidence. Fits with a ∆BIC &gt; 6 can be strongly ruled out as best-fits 57 .</p><p>The most probable parameters, log-likelihood, and Bayesian Evidence values for each models are reported in Supplementary <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, 3, 4, and 5; the best fits are highlighted. All five models favor a westward hotspot offset on the planet, but with varying significance.</p><p>Since the Bayesian Evidence does not allow us to discern which of the 5 is the best model, we elect to look at the ineclipse portion of the lightcurve to discriminate between the models. The in-eclipse portions of the phase curve should be unity once we remove the detector systematics and stellar variability. Fitting a linear function to the in-eclipse segments of the corrected lightcurves, we find the model in which we assumed no stellar variability to be the most consistent with the absence of a trend: the linear fits to the first and second eclipses have slopes of −0.009 ± 0.013 and −0.003 ± 0.01, respectively (see Supplementary <ref type="bibr">Figures 10, 11 and 12 in Sup- plementary Figures)</ref>. Since the in-eclipse flatness test favors the model with stable stellar flux over the models with the inclusion of stellar variability, it suggests that the models with stable stellar flux is a better representation of the underlying astrophysics.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the inclusion of a sinusoidal stellar variation model can introduce degeneracy as seen in <ref type="table">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</ref>, which can lead to less consistent parameter estimates and larger uncertainties. As a sanity check, we include a fit performed using an entirely independent photometry and fitting pipeline <ref type="bibr">58</ref> . Using a higher-order PLD method coupled with a linear trend as model for the stellar variability, we find a westward offset of 25.6 ± 1.9 degrees, confirming the westward offset obtained with the first pipeline.</p><p>Note, moreover, that all of the models exhibit a slightly declining flux during eclipse which is consistent with the fit obtained using the higher-order PLD pipeline. This suggests that if anything, we are slightly underestimating the magnitude of the westward hotspot offset: if the eclipse bottom were flat, then the flux would be even greater after eclipse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surface Brightness Map</head><p>Due to the orbital motion and rotation of the planet, the region of the planet facing us changes over time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Reduction</head><p>For our analysis, we use basic calibrated data which are corrected (dark subtracted, flat-fielded, linearized and flux calibrated) using the S19.2.0 IRAC pipeline. After the data cube diagnostics described in Supplementary Information, we find a frame respective flux modulation introduced by inaccurate dark subtraction. We then correct for the flux modulation using an image stack provided by the IRAC team, which also fixes the known 58th frame error in Spitzer sub-array data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">25</ref> .</p><p>We convert the pixel intensity from MJy/str to electron counts by multiplying the pixel values by GAIN × EXP-TIME/FLUXCONV. We use the parameter values AINTBEG and ATIMEEND to obtain the middle of each exposure assuming uniform temporal spacing between each frame. We mask the pixels with NaN values which are a result of energetic particle hits or pixel defects. Masking is preferred over replacing them with average values to minimize the correction and manipulation of the data.</p><p>We perform pixel-level sigma clipping by comparing each pixel with the median of the same pixel of all the frames in its respective data cube and masking 4σ outliers. Frames containing a sigma-clipped pixel located in a 5 × 5 pixel box centered on the central pixel of the target are discarded entirely. A total of 191 images were tossed out, representing 0.22% of the total data. We perform frame-by-frame background subtraction where sky background level is estimated as the median pixel value of the frame excluding a 7 × 7 pixel box centered on the pixel <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">15)</ref> containing both the target and the companion. Additionally, the retained data exhibit a 2.5 hours ramp-like behavior at the beginning with rapidly changing PSF metrics. This effect may be related to the settling of the telescope at a new pointing <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . Experimenting with and without removing the ramp-like behavior, we find that it is difficult to constrain the detector model during the 2.5 hours as the the PSF properties are notably different from the rest of the data, as described below. Since trimming is standard practice for Spitzer phase curves 4, 7 , we elect to discard the first 2.5 hours of data. After data removal, the remaining data we use for our analysis contains 1288 data cubes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photometry Extraction</head><p>Observations of CoRoT-2 (K = 10.31) <ref type="bibr">38</ref> show the presence of a close-in visual companion, 2MASS J19270636+0122577 (K = 12.03) <ref type="bibr">39</ref> . Due to the proximity of the companion, naively performing aperture photometry could lead to inaccurate estimation of the transit and secondary eclipse depths. We experiment with different strategies to retrieve our target's flux while reducing the contamination from the second source.</p><p>First, we fit for both sources simultaneously using two 2D Gaussians for each frame and retrieve the photometry from the fit. The second strategy is to fit for both sources, then subtract the fit for the companion from each frame and perform aperture photometry on the companion-subtracted image. The third strategy is to oversample the images by a factor of 2 and use aperture photometry. The fourth scheme combines the second and third strategy: we fit for both sources simultaneously using the oversampled images and then subtract the fit for the companion and use aperture photometry.</p><p>To retrieve the target's flux, we experiment with various apertures: hard-edged and soft-edged circular apertures of various radii. While the PSF metrics vary from one frame to another, we chose to keep the position of the aperture fixed. As the centroids only moves over a tenth of the area of a pixel throughout the observation, an aperture of radius 2-3 pixels is large enough to collect all the flux despite the changes in centroid. In principle, an aperture varying in shape and size should improve the photometry, but in practice, we find that a fixed aperture performs better. This suggests that the uncertainties on measurements of the PSF's position and shape for each frame introduce noise into the time-varying aperture photometry.</p><p>To determine the best photometric schemes, we calculate the root-mean-squared (RMS) scatter for each light curve as shown in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 7</ref> and choose the one exhibiting the smallest RMS scatter. In general, we find that the light curves obtained from PSF fitting and aperture photometry on oversampled images exhibit larger RMS scatter. Ultimately, we use photometry on non-oversampled images using a soft-edged circular aperture with a radius of 2.25 pixel after the subtraction of the PSF of the companion as it yields the smallest RMS scatter.</p><p>Moreover, the residual flux from the companion subtraction is less than 0.05% of the target flux, which does not significantly impact centroid measurements. We estimate the residual flux by placing a circular aperture (r = 2.25 pixels) at a symmetric location on the other side of CoRoT-2's companion on the companion-subtracted images. Therefore, the counts in this aperture are the residuals from companion subtraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Centroids</head><p>Due to drift and jitter of the telescope pointing, the position of the target point spread function (PSF) on the detector varies with time. After the frame by frame removal of the companion, we determine the centroid (x 0 , y 0 ) of CoRoT-2 in each frame by / calculating the flux-weighted mean of a 5 × 5 box centered on the brightest pixel located at <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">15</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">x 0 = ∑ i F i x i ∑ i F i ,<label>(S1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">y 0 = ∑ i F i y i ∑ i F i .<label>(S2)</label></formula><p>The shape of the PSF also changes from one frame to another.

We instead opt to estimate the x and y extent of the point spread function of the target separately by computing the standard deviation along each direction for each frame:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">σ x = ∑ i F i (x i − x 0 ) 2 ∑ i F i ,<label>(S4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_25">σ y = ∑ i F i (y i − y 0 ) 2 ∑ i F i .<label>(S5)</label></formula><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, the size of the PSF shape is a non-monotonic function of the centroid position on the pixel. As previously mentioned, the data collected during the first 2.5 hours of the observation exhibit a ramp-like behavior which coincide with a brief change in the position and shape of the PSF 74 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noise in Spitzer IRAC Data due to Bias Dark Subtraction</head><p>Unlike cryogenic Spitzer data, the Warm Spitzer sub-array data exhibit a frame dependent background flux systematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">25</ref> . Such known systematics include the 58 th frame error and the first frame effect. The 58 th frame error is due to a problem in the skydark subtraction stage which leaves the background level in that frame different from the rest. On the other hand, the first few frames have low backgrounds, due the "first frame effect" which impacts every IRAC observation and depends on the delay time since last exposure. In principle, the background-subtracted flux of the target should be immune to such variations, but this has not been borne out in practice, leading researchers to remove certain frames from their analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">25</ref> .</p><p>Once we obtained the sky background level, centroid position, and PSF shape for each frame, we perform aperture photometry on the background and companion subtracted images for each frame using a soft-edged 2.25 pixel radius circular aperture. We normalize each value to its respective data cube median. We then find the median value for each frame number presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. While performing this analysis, we notice that the background subtracted flux exhibits a repeating zigzag pattern between the 18 th and 26 th from one AOR to the other as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>. This modulation was introduced at the Sky Dark subtraction stage of the S19.2.0 IRAC pipeline, the only frame-dependent process that affect IRAC data. Indeed, when we perform aperture photometry on the central pixels of the dark calibration cube, we see the same zigzag pattern in reverse. The IRAC team provided us with an image stack to remove this effect which also fixed the 58 th frame error. After the correction, our analysis shows no significant flux variation, therefore all frames within a data cube provide usable photometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Binning</head><p>Although the recalibration cube provided by the IRAC team corrected the obvious frame dependent systematics (see Supplementary Information), subarray data are still subject to effects such as the first frame effect, which in principle should not affect the photometry. Nonetheless, we choose to play it safe and elect to median bin the data by datacube. Given our 2 seconds exposures, the binned data have a temporal resolution of 128 seconds. Since the duration of ingress and egress of the system is over 1400 seconds, such resolution is still short enough to resolve the shape of occultations.</p><p>Binning data before fitting a model has many advantages <ref type="bibr">49</ref> . First, binning data filters out high frequency noise, including the datacube systematics. Secondly, it increases the accuracy of our measurement of the PSF metrics. Our instrumental models are a function of PSF metrics, hence more accurate measurements improve our ability to decorrelate the detector systematics from the astrophysical signal. Finally, reducing the number of data ultimately makes model fitting significantly faster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>/ Upper Limit on Stellar Variability at 4.5 µm</head><p>The Spitzer Space Telescope is on a heliocentric Earth-trailing orbit and is drifting away from Earth at about 0.1 AU per year. Consequently, at the time of our CoRoT-2 system observations, Spitzer was approximately 1.5 AU away from Earth and therefore had a significantly different field of regard than the Earth. For this reason, we could not obtain ground-based optical observations of the system around the time of the Spitzer observations to monitor stellar variability.</p><p>Instead, we estimate the upper limit of the magnitude of stellar variability at 4.5 µm using the observations acquired by the CoRoT mission. The CoRoT observations show that the optical stellar flux varies by at most 5% in 2-day intervals <ref type="bibr">35</ref> , due to the inhomogeneous star spot area coverage of CoRoT-2. Using the reported mean star spots temperature 75 , T • , of 4700 ± 300 K, so assuming an isophotal wavelength, λ , of the CoRoT passband of 700 nm, one can approximate an out of transit stellar flux as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">F s (T * , T • , f , λ ) = (1 − f ) B λ (T * , λ ) + f B λ (T • , λ )<label>(S6)</label></formula><p>where T * = 5625 K is the effective photospheric temperature of star, f is the fraction of total spot area and B λ (T, λ ) is Planck's law. Assuming a 4.0% spot coverage on one of the hemispheres, we calculate that a 13% spot coverage on the other hemisphere corresponds to the maximal 5% flux variation. Extrapolating this to 4.5 µm, we find a stellar variability upper limit of 2.0%,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surface Brightness</head><p>As described in the methods section, the planetary phase variation can be described more generally as a Fourier series of order N:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">F p (ξ ) = F 0 + N ∑ j=1 C j cos( jξ ) + D j sin( jξ ) (S7)</formula><p>where ξ is the orbital phase. Note that sinusoidal modes with odd j other than j = 1 are not expected to have a phase function signature for an edge-on orbit <ref type="bibr">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">76</ref> . If the rotation period of the planet is known, then phase variations allow us to constrain the longitudinal brightness of a planet. For tidally locked planets, the above phase variation corresponds to a longitudinal surface brightness map J(φ ) given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">J(φ ) = A 0 + N ∑ j=1 A j cos( jξ ) + B j sin( jξ ) (S8)</formula><p>where φ is the longitude from the substellar point. One can directly relate the coefficient from equations S7 and S8 44 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">A 0 = 1 2 F 0 A 1 = 2 π C 1 B 1 = −2 π D 1 . . . A j = (−1) j/2 −( j 2 −1) 2 C j B j = (−1) j/2 ( j 2 −1) 2 D j (S9)</formula><p>where j is even. Phase variations do not provide any latitudinal brightness constraints for an edge-on orbit. One can therefore express the flux contribution of an infinitesimal longitudinal slice as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">J(φ ) = π 0 I(φ , θ ) sin 2 θ dθ (S10)</formula><p>where θ is the latitude from the substellar point and I(φ , θ ) is the brightness at the coordinates (φ , θ ). Assuming that the brightness drops off away from the equator as the sine of co-latitude, one can express intensity at a infinitesimal surface area at longitude φ and latitude θ as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">I(φ , θ ) = 3 4 J(φ ) sin(θ ).<label>(S11)</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
