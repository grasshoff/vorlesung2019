			<abstract>
				<p>We report the discovery of HAT-P-24b, a transiting extrasolar planet orbiting the moderately bright V=11.818 F8 dwarf star GSC 0774-01441, with a period P = 3.3552464 ± 0.0000071 d, transit epoch T c = 2455216.97669 ± 0.00024 (BJD a), and transit duration 3.653 ± 0.025 hours. The host star has a mass of 1.191 ± 0.042 M ⊙ , radius of 1.317 ± 0.068 R ⊙ , effective temperature 6373 ± 80 K, and a low metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.16 ± 0.08. The planetary companion has a mass of 0.681 ± 0.031 M J , and radius of 1.243 ± 0.072 R J yielding a mean density of 0.439 ± 0.069 g cm −3. By repeating our global fits with different parameter sets, we have performed a critical investigation of the fitting techniques used for previous HAT planetary discoveries. We find that the system properties are robust against the choice of priors. The effects of fixed versus fitted limb darkening are also examined. HAT-P-24b probably maintains a small eccentricity of e = 0.052 +0.022 −0.017 , which is accepted over the circular orbit model with false alarm probability 5.8%. In the absence of eccentricity pumping, this result suggests HAT-P-24b experiences less tidal dissipation than Jupiter. Due to relatively rapid stellar rotation, we estimate that HAT-P-24b should exhibit one of the largest known Rossiter-McLaughlin effect amplitudes for an exoplanet (∆V RM ≃ 95 m/s) and thus a precise measurement of the sky-projected spin-orbit alignment should be possible.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The understanding of planetary systems has been spearheaded by the study of transiting extrasolar planets in recent years. Eclipses have long offered a key to unlocking the secrets of the heavenly bodies, for example in Solar System studies and in the field of eclipsing binaries. For exoplanets, an eclipse offers a door into the innerworkings of an alien system hundreds of light-years away. As an inherently low probability event, each and every transiting system is precious and timeless to the planetary scientist. Transits continue to offer unprecedented access to an exoplanet's nature and allow for, amongst other things, the determination of the oblateness of a planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Seager &amp; Hui (2002)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Carter &amp; Winn (2010)</ref>), thermal mapping of the planetary surface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>) and accurate planetary radii at the percent level ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Charbonneau et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network (HATNet; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bakos et al. 2004</ref>) survey has been one of the principal contributors to the discovery of transiting extrasolar planets (TEPs). In operation since 2003, it has now covered approximately 14% of the sky, searching for TEPs around bright stars <ref type="bibr">(8 I 14.0)</ref>. HATNet operates six wide-field instruments: four at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona, and two on the roof of the hangar housing the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Submillimeter Array, in Hawaii. Since 2006, HATNet has discovered 23 TEPs (with 16 announced or published so far). In this work we report our 24th discovery, around the relatively bright star previously known as GSC 0774-01441.</p><p>In Section 2 we report the detection of the photometric signal and the follow-up spectroscopic and photometric observations of HAT-P-24. In Section 3 we describe the analysis of the data, beginning with the determination of the stellar parameters, continuing with a discussion of the methods used to rule out non-planetary, false positive scenarios which could mimic the photometric and spectroscopic observations, and finishing with a description of our global modeling of the photometry and radial velocities. In Section 4 we investigate the variations of our results using different parameter sets with uniform priors to test the robustness of the fitted parameters. We also discuss the effects of fitting versus fixing limb darkening coefficients. In Section 5 to Section 8, we present discus-sions and analyses of the orbital eccentricity, a possible linear drift in the RVs, the measured mid-transit times and possibilities for future follow-up observations. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Photometric detection</head><p>The transits of HAT-P-24b were detected with the HAT-5 and HAT-6 telescopes in Arizona, and with the HAT-8 and HAT-9 telescopes in Hawaii. The star GSC 0774-01441 lies in the overlap of two fields, internally labeled as 315 (07:30 +15:00) and 314 (07:00 +15:00). The former field was observed on a nightly basis between 2007 October and 2008 May, while the latter field was observed between 2008 November and 2009 May. For field 315 we gathered 8551 R band exposures of 5 minutes at a 5.5 minute cadence, while for field 314 we gathered 5503 Sloan r band images with the same exposure time and cadence. Each field 315 image contained approximately 51,000 stars down to R ∼ 14, while each 314 image contained approximately 130,000 stars down to r ∼ 14.5. For the brightest stars in field 315, we achieved a per-image photometric precision of 3 mmag, while for field 314 we achieved 5 mmag precision. Orbital phase <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-Unbinned light curve of HAT-P-24 including all 14,000 instrumental R band and Sloan r band 5.5 minute cadence measurements obtained with the HAT-5, HAT-6, HAT-8 and HAT-9 telescopes of HATNet (see the text for details), and folded with the period P = 3.3552401 days resulting from the global fit described in Section 3). The solid line shows the "P1P3" transit model fit to the light curve (Section 3.3). Solid squares show the 20-point binned light curve.</p><p>The calibration of the HATNet frames was carried out using standard photometric procedures. For field 314 the calibrated images were then subjected to star detection and astrometry, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Pál &amp; Bakos (2006)</ref>. Aperture photometry was performed on each image at the stellar centroids derived from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) catalog and the individual astrometric solutions. For field 315 we performed image subtraction photometry following the methods described in <ref type="bibr">Pál (2009b)</ref>. Aperture photometry was performed on the difference images at the stellar centroid derived from 2MASS, while for the reference flux we adopted the r magnitude of each star, transformed from its 2MASS J, H and K S magnitudes, and made use of the average relation between r and flux measured on the reference image via aperture photometry. The resulting light curves for both fields were decorrelated (cleaned of trends) using the External Parameter Decorrelation (EPD; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. 2010)</ref> technique in "constant" mode and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kovács et al. 2005</ref>). The light curves from each field were independently searched for periodic box-shaped signals using the Box Least-Squares (BLS; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kovács et al. 2002)</ref> method. We detected a significant signal in both of the HATNet light curves of GSC 0774-01441 (also known as 2MASS 07151801+1415453; α = 07 h 15 m 18.00s, δ = +14 • 15 ′ 45.4 ′′ ; J2000; V=11.818 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Droege et al. 2006</ref>), with an apparent depth of ∼ 7.2 mmag, and a period of P = 3.3552 days (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Reconnaissance Spectroscopy</head><p>As is routine in the HATNet project, all candidates are observed spectroscopically initially to establish whether the transit-like feature in the light curve is of nonplanetary origin such a grazing eclipsing binary (i.e. a false positive). For example, large radial-velocity variations of the star (tens of km s −1 ) would indicate such a circumstance.</p><p>To perform this task, we used the HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Digital Speedometer (DS; Latham 1992); an echelle spectrograph mounted on the FLWO 1.5 m telescope. This instrument delivers high-resolution spectra (λ/∆λ ≈ 35,000) over a single order centered on the Mg I b triplet (∼5187Å∼5187Å), with typically low signal-to-noise (S/N∼ 10) ratios that are nevertheless sufficient to derive radial velocities (RVs) with moderate precisions of 0.5-1.0 km s −1 for slowly rotating stars. The same spectra can be used to estimate the effective temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity of the host star, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Torres et al. (2002)</ref>. With this facility we are able to reject many types of false positives, such as F dwarfs orbited by M dwarfs, grazing eclipsing binaries, or triple or quadruple star systems.</p><p>For HAT-P-24 we obtained five observations with the DS between 2008 May and 2009 January. The velocity measurements showed an r.m.s. residual of 0.74 km s −1 , consistent with no detectable RV variation within the precision of the measurements. All spectra were singlelined, i.e., there is no evidence for additional stars in the system. The atmospheric parameters we infer from these observations are the following: effective temperature T eff⋆ = 7000 ± 100 K, surface gravity log g ⋆ = 4.5 ± 0.25 (log cgs), and projected rotational velocity v sin i = 11.2 ± 1.0 km s −1 . The effective temperature corresponds to a F8 dwarf. The mean heliocentric RV of HAT-P-24 is γ RV = −2.09 ± 0.33 km s −1 . We stress that the DS stellar parameters are based on solar composition models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">High resolution, high S/N spectroscopy</head><p>Given the significant transit detection by HATNet, and the encouraging DS results that rule out obvious false positives, we proceeded with the follow-up of this candidate by obtaining high-resolution, high-S/N spectra to characterize the RV variations, and to refine the determination of the stellar parameters. For this we used the HIRES instrument ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Vogt et al. 1994</ref>) on the Keck I telescope located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, between 2009 April and 2009 December. The width of the spec-trometer slit was 0. ′′ 86, resulting in a resolving power of λ/∆λ ≈ 55,000, with a wavelength coverage of ∼3800-8000Å8000Å.</p><p>We obtained 18 exposures through an iodine gas absorption cell, which was used to superimpose a dense forest of I 2 lines on the stellar spectrum and establish an accurate wavelength fiducial (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marcy &amp; Butler 1992</ref>). An additional two exposures were taken without the iodine cell, for use as templates in the reductions. In practice, we used only the second higher S/N template spectrum. Relative RVs in the solar system barycentric frame were derived as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Butler et al. (1996)</ref>, incorporating full modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the instrumental profile. The RV measurements and their uncertainties are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The period-folded data, along with a best fit described below in Section 3, are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. In the same figure we show also the relative S index, which is a measure of the chromospheric activity of the star derived from the flux in the cores of the Ca II H and K lines. This index was computed following the prescription given by Vaughan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Preston &amp; Wilson (1978)</ref>, after matching each spectrum to a reference spectrum using a transformation that includes a wavelength shift and a flux scaling that is a polynomial as a function of wavelength. The transformation was determined on regions of the spectra that are not used in computing this indicator. Note that our relative S index has not been calibrated to the scale of Vaughan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Preston &amp; Wilson (1978)</ref>. The RMS of the relative S values is 3%, which is higher than the median formal error of 0.6% based on photon statistics, however the errors in this case are likely dominated by systematics in the spectrum matching procedure, which are difficult to quantify, so we do not consider this to be a robust detection of variability. We note that a 3% variation is comparable to that found for other late F stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Shkolnik et al. 2008</ref> measured a ∼ 1% median absolute deviation in the fluxes of the K line cores for τ Boo and HD 179949, which corresponds to a similar expected RMS).</p><p>We also note that S is uncorrelated with orbital phase; such a correlation might have indicated that the RV variations could be due to stellar activity, casting doubt on the planetary nature of the candidate. There is no sign of emission in the cores of the Ca II H and K lines (S/N∼ 38) in any of our spectra, from which we conclude that the chromospheric activity level in HAT-P-24 is very low.  .5 } light curve parameter set and fitted limb darkening, in combination with an eccentric orbit RV fit.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Properties of the parent star</head><p>Fundamental parameters of the host star HAT-P-24 such as the mass (M ⋆ ) and radius (R ⋆ ), which are needed to infer the planetary properties, depend strongly on other stellar quantities that can be derived spectroscopically. For this we have relied on our template spectrum obtained with the Keck/HIRES instrument, and the analysis package known as Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Valenti &amp; Piskunov 1996)</ref>, along with the atomic line database of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref>. SME yielded the following initial values and uncertainties (which we have conservatively increased for T eff⋆ and [Fe/H] to include our estimates of the systematic errors): effective temperature T eff⋆ = 6188 ± 80 K, stellar surface gravity log g ⋆ = 4.01 ± 0.06 (cgs), metallicity [Fe/H] = −0.26 ± 0.08 dex, and projected rotational velocity v sin i = 10.5 ± 0.5 km s −1 .</p><p>In principle the effective temperature and metallicity, along with the surface gravity taken as a luminosity indicator, could be used as constraints to infer the stellar mass and radius by comparison with stellar evolution models. For planetary transits a stronger constraint is often provided by the a/R ⋆ normalized semi-major axis, which is closely related to ρ ⋆ , the mean stellar density. The quantity a/R ⋆ can be derived directly from the transit light curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas 2003)</ref> and the RV data (for eccentric cases, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kipping (2010)</ref>). This, in turn, allows us to improve on the determination of the spectroscopic parameters by supplying an indirect constraint on the weakly determined spectroscopic value of log g ⋆ that removes degeneracies. We take this approach here, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>. The validity of our assumption, namely that the adequate physical model describing our data is a planetary transit (as opposed to a blend), is shown later in Section 3.2.</p><p>After the first iteration for determining the stellar properties, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>, we find that the surface gravity, log g ⋆ = 4.27 ± 0.04, is significantly different from our initial SME analysis, which is not surprising in view of the strong correlations among T eff⋆ , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and log g ⋆ that are often present in spectroscopic determinations. Therefore, we carried out a second iteration in which we adopted this value of log g ⋆ and held it fixed in a new SME analysis (cou-HAT-P-24b   Experience with the SME analysis for previous HAT planets leads us to select this estimate. A further iteration did not change log g ⋆ significantly, so we adopted the values stated above as the final atmospheric properties of the star. They are collected in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, together with the adopted values for the macroturbulent and microturbulent velocities.</p><p>The low metallicity of HAT-P-24 is interesting in that a well-known bias exists for finding giant planets around metal-rich stars ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Johnson et al. (2010)</ref> find that the occurrence of giant planets scales as f ∼ 10 1.2 <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and also report a scaling with stellar mass of f ∼ M * . This means that the a-priori probability of finding a planet around HAT-P-24 is a respectable ∼ 75% that of a Solar-like star.</p><p>With the adopted spectroscopic parameters the model isochrones yield the stellar mass and radius M ⋆ = 1.191± 0.042 M ⊙ and R ⋆ = 1.317 ± 0.068 R ⊙ , along with other properties listed at the bottom of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. HAT-P-24 is a F8 dwarf star with an estimated age of 2.8 ± 0.6 Gyr, according to these models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yi et al. 2001</ref>).  The stellar evolution modeling provides color indices that may be compared against the measured values as a consistency check. The best available measurements are the near-infrared magnitudes from the 2MASS Catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>), J 2MASS = 10.797 ± 0.022, H 2MASS = 10.589 ± 0.024 and K 2MASS = 10.543 ± 0.020; which we have converted to the photometric system of the models (ESO system) using the transformations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carpenter 2001</ref>). The resulting measured color index is J − K = 0.274 ± 0.032. This is within 1σ of the predicted value from the isochrones of J −K = 0.29±0.02. The distance to the object may be computed from the absolute K magnitude from the models (M K = 2.59 ± 0.11) and the 2MASS K s magnitude, which has the advantage of being less affected by extinction than optical magnitudes. The result is 396 ± 20 pc, where the uncertainty excludes possible systematics in the model isochrones that are difficult to quantify.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Global modeling of the data</head><p>This section briefly describes the procedure we followed to model the HATNet photometry, the followup photometry, and the radial velocities simultaneously. More details on the fitting methods can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>. Our model for the follow-up light curves used the analytic formulae of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> with quadratic limb darkening coefficients interpolated from the tables by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Claret (2004)</ref>. The transit shape was parametrized by the ratio-of-radii p ≡ R p /R ⋆ , the square of the impact parameter b 2 , and the reciprocal of the half duration of the transit ζ/R ⋆ . We denote this fitting set as {p,b 2 ,ζ/R * }. This set is chosen because of their simple geometric meanings and the fact that these exhibit low correlations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. 2010</ref>). Our model for the HATNet data was the simplified "P1P3" version of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> analytic functions following the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>. Following the formalism presented by <ref type="bibr">Pál (2009)</ref>, the RVs were fitted with an eccentric Keplerian model parametrized by the semi-amplitude K and Lagrangian elements k ≡ e cos ω and h ≡ e sin ω, in which ω is the longitude of periastron.</p><p>Assuming a linear ephemeris, we assign the transit number N tr = 0 to the complete follow-up light curve gathered on 2010 Feb 15. The eight main parameters describing the physical model were thus T c,−250 , T c,0 , R p /R ⋆ , b 2 , ζ/R ⋆ , K, k ≡ e cos ω, and h ≡ e sin ω. Five additional parameters were included that have to do with the instrumental configuration. These are the HATNet blend factors B inst,315 and B inst,316 , which account for possible dilution of the transit in the HATNet light curves from background stars due to the broad PSF (20 ′′ FWHM), the HATNet out-of-transit magnitudes M 0,HATNet,315 and M 0,HATNet,316 , and the relative zero-point γ rel of the Keck RVs.</p><p>We extended our physical model with an instrumental model that describes brightness variations caused by systematic errors in the measurements as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>. The HATNet photometry has already been EPD-and TFA-corrected before the global modeling, so we only considered corrections for systematics in the follow-up light curves. We chose the "ELTG" method, i.e., EPD was performed in "local" mode with EPD coefficients defined for each night, and TFA was performed in "global" mode using the same set of stars and TFA coefficients for all nights, as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>The joint fit was accomplished using downhill simplex (AMOEBA;see <ref type="bibr">Press et al. 1992</ref>) and the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method <ref type="bibr">(MCMC, see Ford 2006</ref>) using "Hyperplane-CLLS" chains ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. 2010</ref>) and the analytic partial derivatives for the transit light curve from <ref type="bibr">Pál (2009)</ref>. A detailed description can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>. The resulting geometric parameters pertaining to the light curves and velocity curves are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. Quotes values are the median and the error on the median from the a posteriori distribution of each parameter.</p><p>Included in this table is the RV "jitter", which we added in quadrature to the internal errors for the RVs in order to achieve χ 2 /dof = 1 from the RV data for the global fit. Auxiliary parameters not listed in the table are: T c,−250 = 2454405.00857 ± 0.00162 (BJD), T c,0 = 2455243.81859 ± 0.00029 (BJD), the blending factors B instr,314 = 0.83 ± 0.05 and B instr,315 = 0.69 ± 0.03, and γ rel = 3.20 ± 2.62 m s −1 . The latter quantity represents an arbitrary offset for the Keck RVs, and does not correspond to the true center of mass velocity of the system, which was listed earlier in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> (γ RV ).</p><p>The planetary parameters and their uncertainties can be derived by combining the a posteriori distributions for the stellar, light curve, and RV parameters. In this way we find a mass for the planet of M p = 0.685 ± 0.033 M J and a radius of R p = 1.242 ± 0.067 R J , leading to a mean density ρ p = 0.44 ± 0.07 g cm −3 . These and other planetary parameters are listed at the bottom of Table 5. We note that the system may be slightly eccentric: e = 0.067 ± 0.024, ω = 197 ± 36 • .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Alternative fitting parameter sets</head><p>The fitting method adopted for the values quoted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> uses the parameter set {p,ζ/R * ,b 2 }, chosen for their low inter-parameter correlations. ζ/R * is the reciprocal of the half-duration as computed using an approximate expression for the duration coming from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Tingley &amp; Sackett (2005)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kipping (2010)</ref> showed that an improved approximate formula is possible for the duration. Replacing ζ/R * with the reciprocal of the new expression for the half-duration therefore offers greater accuracy for the duration determination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kipping (2010)</ref> labeled this parameter as Υ/R * to be distinct from ζ/R * . The new parameter set yields the greatest improvements for near-grazing, low-eccentricity orbits.</p><p>To investigate the robustness of the results against different parameter sets, we refitted the EPD, TFA corrected HAT and FLWO light curves in conjunction with the radial velocities using the {p 2 ,b 2 ,Υ/R * } parameter set. Radial velocities are fitted using the Lagrange parameters as in Section 3.3. A new YY ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yi et al. 2001</ref>) isochrone analysis is performed as described in Section 3.1 to show the effect on the physical parameters. The results are shown in the first results column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>The b 2 parameter also gives us some pause for thought. One natural reason to select b 2 is that the duration of a transit is completely described in terms of b 2 i.e. there is no case of an isolated b which is not squared in the expression for the duration. Therefore, b 2 seems to be a natural parameter of the transit light curve. Further, b 2 usually shows lower inter-parameter correlations than b.</p><p>However, there are also two reasons why one should not choose b 2 . Firstly, geometrically b is more likely to have a uniform prior than b 2 . Therefore, low signal-to-noise transits will be biased towards higher impact parameters by fitting for b 2 . Secondly, b 2 cannot be negative and thus the posterior distribution of b 2 tends to get offset to an artificially more positive value due to the boundary condition that b 2 &gt; 0. One resolution to this is to use b and let the parameter explore both negative and positive values. Whilst a negative impact parameter may seem unphysical, the issue of its physicality is also irrelevant since the transit is completely described in terms of b 2 and thus a negative b is always multiplied by itself when computing the light curve morphology. Using b in this way permits for a symmetric distribution about b = 0 and thus improved estimates of the associated uncertainty.</p><p>To investigate the value of fitting for b, we repeated our global fits using the parameter set {p 2 ,b,T 1.5,3.5 }. T 1.5,3.5 replaces Υ/R * since although it may be slightly more correlated, it is more reasonable to expect a uniform prior on the duration than a uniform prior on its reciprocal. The results of these fits are shown in the third results column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>The system values quoted between {p 2 ,b 2 , ζ/R * }, {p 2 ,b 2 , Υ/R * } and {p 2 ,b,T 1.5,3.5 } show excellent agreement and thus indicate that the system parameters are insensitive to the choice of priors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Fitted limb darkening</head><p>We repeated the fits for the {p 2 ,b 2 , Υ/R * } and {p 2 ,b,T 1.5,3.5 } parameter sets with fitted limb darkening (second and fourth result columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> respectively). In order to achieve convergence, we choose to only use linear limb darkening and thus fix the quadratic coefficient to be zero.</p><p>The results show slight differences with the fixed limb darkening analogues. The most noticeable effect is increased error bars. Fitting for limb darkening means that our results are no longer dependent upon a stellar atmosphere model prediction, which is a clear desideratum. Our preferred final values are given by the {p 2 ,b,T 1.5,3.5 } parameter set with fitted limb darkening (last column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, with highlighted header).</p><p>Both free limb darkening fits converge at u 1 = 0.25 ± 0.04. For 0.8 &lt; µ &lt; 1, the limb darkening from both the theoretical quadratic coefficients and the fitted coefficients is approximately equivalent. However, for low µ, the theoretical coefficients predict much stronger darkening effects than observed. Fitting a linear law through the quadratic coefficients gives u lin = 0.46, demonstrating the stronger limb darkening predicted from theory.</p></div>

In addition to the four fits displayed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, we repeated our preferred model fit (i.e. {p 2 ,b,T 1.5,3.5 } with fitted limb darkening) for a circular orbit. This was done to provide a χ 2 value for both fits, which can be used to infer the statistical significance of the eccentric fit.</p><p>To accomplish this, we only take the χ 2 from the radial velocity data, which dominates the determination of the Lagrangian orbital parameters and so the number of data points is n = 18. The period and time of transit are dominated by the photometry and very weakly affected by the few RV points. Therefore, these two degrees of freedom can be considered fixed. This leaves us with four degrees of freedom for an eccentric fit (k, h, K, γ) and two for the circular fit <ref type="bibr">(K, γ)</ref>.</p><p>In evaluating the significance of the eccentric fit over the circular model it is important to penalize the eccentric fit for using two extra degrees of freedom. We therefore choose to perform an F-test between the two models. The circular orbit fit has χ 2 = 59.5 and the eccentric fit has χ 2 = 39.6. The false alarm probability from an F-test is evaluated to be 5.8% or 1.9-σ. We also performed the test of <ref type="bibr">Lucy &amp; Sweeney (1971)</ref>, where the statistical significance of the eccentric fit is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(e &gt; 0) = 1 − exp − ˆ e 2 2σ 2 e (1)</formula><p>Wherê e is the modal value of the eccentricity, which is well approximated by the median for a unimode distribution.

Therefore, based upon the current data for this system, an eccentric fit is probable but not conclusive.</p><p>A resolution would be to obtain a secondary eclipse measurement for the system, for which the mid-eclipse time would be dependent upon e cos ω. The k component dominates the eccentricity budget and thus its determination would strongly constrain the eccentricity of this system.</p></div>

Given than Jupiter has Q P ∼ 30, 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lainey et al. 2009</ref>), this limit raises some questions about why HAT-P-24b has such a large value, somewhat similar to the situation for GJ 436b <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Deming et al. 2007</ref>). In none of our 10 5 realizations do we have a Q P value below 150,000 and therefore in the absence of any eccentricity pumping, a large Q P value is a possible origin for the non-zero eccentricity. This is consistent with the observation of large Q P values in many other known TEPs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Matsumura et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>We note that for planets with initial eccentricities ≥ 0.2, the above approximate expressions will be invalid and a full backwards integration of the planet's orbital evolution will be necessary, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Leconte et al.

Such a detailed analysis remains outside of the scope of this paper, but our calculations do flag this system as possibly retaining an anomalously large eccentricity requiring further investigation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Properties of Putative HAT-P-24c</head><p>We proceed here to constrain the properties of HAT-P24c under the assumption the trend is real. Whilst this may not turn out to be true, it is useful to consider what the properties of the outer planet would be should the trend be later confirmed.</p><p>The period of the outer planet would have to be much greater than the timescale of the observations, or a sinusoidal pattern would have emerged and so P c ≫ 265 days, most likely of O ∼ 1000 days which constrains a c 2 AU by Kepler's Third Law. We note that the habitable zone pushes out as a hab = L * /L ⊙ AU and occurs at ∼ 1.6 AU for HAT-P-24 and so the outer planet would likely be "cold". Using equation (1) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Winn et al. (2009)</ref>, the gradient corresponds to an outer planet satisfying:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M c sin i c a 2 c = | ˙ γ| G = 0.082 +0.051 −0.056 M J AU −2<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Based upon the a c constraint, this therefore implies M c sin i c 0.3 M J . Aside from the RVs, there are observational consequences for HAT-P-24b due to the outer planet. The system will behave as an innerouter binary and thus the outer planet will induce a light-time travel effect, potentially detectable with transit timing variations (TTV) of HAT-P-24b. The inner binary will orbit the barycentre with semi-major axis (a c M c sin i c )/(M * + M b ). Therefore the peak-to-peak light-time effect, for an outer planet of negligible eccentricity, will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">TTV light (peak − to − peak) ≃ | ˙ γ| c P 2 c 2π 2<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Adding in the best-fit value of ˙ γ gives TTV light (peak − to − peak) = 0.078(P c /years) 2 s. Therefore, we require P c &gt; 3.6 years for a &gt; 1 second TTV and would need P c &gt; 36 years for a &gt; 100 s TTV. We also evaluated the TTV effect due to a distant, perturbing planet, as described in case IV of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>. We find that a 1000 day period 0.3 M J would generate an r.m.s. TTV of 0.008 s for e c = 0.1, 0.06 s for e c = 0.5 and 0.8 s for e c = 0.9. The challenge of measuring TTVs to this precision over such long time-scales is a daunting one and unlikely to reap any reward with current instrumentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">TRANSIT TIMES</head><p>Whilst the photometric quality of the FLWO data is sufficient for full free fitting, three of the four FLWO light curves are only partial transits and so the errors on the duration and therefore mid-transit time diverge for unconstrained fitting parameters.</p><p>A solution to this is to work under the assumption that the duration and depth of the transit do not change from transit-to-transit. As a result of the partial transits, a transit duration variation (TDV) analysis is therefore not possible but TTVs can be obtained provided it is understood that they are derived as inherently model dependent values, where the model is that of constant duration and depth. We therefore extract the parameters p 2 , b, T , e sin ω, e cos ω, P and the linear limb darkening coefficient u 1 from the posterior distribution of the global fit. We select the {b,T } parameter set with fitted limb darkening as our favorite solution for this purpose. The free parameters of the individual transit fits are OOT and t C . We stress that the parameters assumed to be constant from transit-to-transit are still allowed to float around their median-value with standard deviation given by their derived uncertainties. This ensures the errors are correctly propagated into the mid-times. The final times are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 8</ref>.</p><p>Using the linear ephemeris derived from the global fit, including all HAT data, we find that the FLWO transits show no excess variance yielding χ 2 = 1.3 for 2 degrees of freedom. The RMS of the four O-C values is 34.7 seconds. With only four transit times, it is not possible to conduct a meaningful TTV analysis. However, these transits may be used a benchmark for future TTV searches on this system.</p></div>

The detection of the eclipse would therefore strongly constrain e cos ω which would allow for a revised global fit to the data. Constraining e cos ω in this way would allow us to re-compute the statistical significance of the RV linear drift model over the static model. For Spitzer 's 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm channels, assuming uniform redistribution of energy around the planet and zero albedo, we estimate a depth of ∼ 0.075% and ∼ 0.10%. At K s = 10.5 mag, the brightness is comparable to that of TrES-4 (K s = 10.3 mag) which has been observed with Spitzer and eclipses measured to precisions of 0.011% and 0.016% for the two channels respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knutson et al. 2009</ref>). What HAT-P-24b lacks in a slighter fainter host star it makes up for with a slightly longer duration than TrES-4b (∼ 12000 s for TrES-4b, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mandushev et al. (2007)</ref>, and 13150 s for HAT-P24b). We therefore estimate that the secondary eclipses will be detectable with SNRs of ∼ 7 and ∼ 6 for 3.6µm and 4.5µm respectively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.-Top panel: Keck/HIRES RV measurements for HAT-P-24 shown as a function of orbital phase, along with our best-fit eccentric orbit model (solid) and circular orbit model (dashed).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2.">Transmission Spectroscopy</head><p>Molecular constituents in the terminator of the atmosphere can absorb light and cause the transit depth to increase. The spectral variations in the transit depth allow for the detection of molecules within an exoplanet's atmosphere. This depth change can be estimated from first principles by calculating the scale height of the atmosphere and computing the expected change in transit depth using equation <ref type="formula">(36)</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Winn (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Using the posterior distribution of parameters from the {b,T 1.5,3.5 } fitted-limb-darkening MCMC run, we estimate that ∆δ ≃ (0.014 ± 0.001)N H % where N H is the number of scale heights of atmosphere absorbed by the molecular species (of order unity), and we have used µ M = 2 a.m.u for H 2 . Using the same Spitzer uncertainty estimates from before, we would require N H ∼ 3 for even H 2 to be detectable. Therefore, HAT-P-24b would likely be a challenging target for transmission spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3.">Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</head><p>Owing to HAT-P-24's relatively rapid stellar rotation, a large Rossiter-McLaughlin effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rossiter (1924)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McLaughlin (1924)</ref>) amplitude is expected. Equally, a large signal for spectral line tomography could be detectable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cameron et al. 2010</ref>). Using equation <ref type="formula">(40)</ref> from <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Winn (2010)</ref>, and the posterior distribution of parameters from the {b,T 1.5,3.5 } fitted-limb-darkening MCMC run, we estimate ∆V RM = (95 ± 5) m/s. Given the RV measurements are essentially jitter-limited at 7.2 m/s, this indicates that we expect a very large signal-to-noise for the RM effect of HAT-P-24b, reaching SNR∼13.</p><p>Another motivation for measuring the planet's RM effect is that HAT-P-24 has an effective temperature of T eff = (6373 ± 80) K and thus lies above the ∼ 6250 K threshold for which most system seem to exhibit significant obliquities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Winn et al. 2010)</ref>. This therefore indicates that we can not only expect a very large RM effect but also possibly a highly oblique configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gaudi &amp; Winn (2007)</ref> showed that v sin i and λ become degenerate for low impact parameter transits and so the large RM amplitude predicted for this system should help in solving for the system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">SUMMARY</head><p>We announce the detection of a 0.68 M J transiting exoplanet on a 3.36 day orbit around an F8 star (system parameters are found in the last column of Table 6). We find that the planet retains a small eccentricity of e = 0.052 +0.022 −0.017 with a 5.8% false alarm probability, which may suggest either a perturbing planet in the system or low tidal dissipation within the planet of Q P (6 ± 3) × 10 6 . Most of the eccentricity originates from the e cos ω term and thus we predict that a secondary eclipse observation, which is shown to be feasible, should confirm/reject the eccentricity hypothesis conclusively.</p><p>We have performed a detailed investigation of the effects upon the system parameters by using different fitting sets. In three different parameter sets, we find a consistent solution indicating the result is not sensitive to the priors. The effects of fixing versus fitting limb darkening coefficients are also investigated, which leads to slightly increased error bars but a consistent best-fit solution.</p><p>Using the Bayesian Information Criterion as a model selection tool, we find the Keck radial velocities are best described by a model consisting of non-zero orbital eccentricity and a negative linear drift of (−14.6 ± 10.2) m/s/year with a false alarm probability of 20%. We consider this trend to be currently not statistically significant, but warranting further investigation.</p><p>HAT-P-24 has a relatively rapid stellar rotation of v sin i = (10.0 ± 0.5) km/s, and we therefore predict HAT-P-24b should exhibit one of the largest known Rossiter-McLaughlin effect amplitudes for an exoplanet (∆V RM ≃ 95 m/s). Further, it has recently been suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Winn et al. (2010)</ref> that hot-stars have companions on preferentially oblique orbits and so HAT-P-24 (T eff = (6373 ± 80) K) would be an excellent target to further investigate this hypothesis.
