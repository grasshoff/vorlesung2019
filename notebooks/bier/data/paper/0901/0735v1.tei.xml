				<p>Time-dependent insolation in a planetary atmosphere induces a mass quadrupole upon which the stellar tidal acceleration can exert a force. This &quot;thermal tide&quot; force can give rise to secular torques on the planet and orbit as well as radial forces causing eccentricity evolution. We apply this idea to the close-in gas giant exoplanets (&quot;hot Jupiters&quot;). The response of radiative atmospheres is computed in a hydrostatic model which treats the insolation as a time-dependent heat source, and solves for thermal radiation using flux-limited diffusion. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations are compared to solutions of the linearized equations, as well as analytic approximations, all of which are in good agreement. We find generically that thermal tide density perturbations lead the semi-diurnal forcing. As a result thermal tides can generate asynchronous spin and eccentricity. Applying our calculations to the hot Jupiters, we find the following results: (1) Departure from synchronous spin is significant for hot Jupiters, and increases with orbital period. (2) Ongoing gravitational tidal dissipation in spin equilibrium leads to steady-state internal heating rates up to ∼ 10 28 erg s −1. If deposited sufficiently deep, these heating rates may explain the anomalously large radii of many hot Jupiters in terms of a &quot;tidal main sequence&quot; where cooling balances tidal heating. At fixed stellar type, planet mass and tidal Q, planetary radius increases strongly toward the star inside orbital periods 2 weeks. (3) There exists a narrow window in orbital period where small eccentricities, e, grow exponentially with a large rate. This window may explain the ∼ 1/4 of hot Jupiters which should have been circularized by the gravitational tide long ago, but are observed to have significant nonzero e. Conversely, outside this window, the thermal and gravitational tide both act to damp e, complicating the ability to constrain the planet&apos;s tidal Q.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>A number of puzzles have arisen for the gas giant exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars, the "hot Jupiters."</p><p>A large fraction of transiting hot Jupiters are observed to have radii far larger than the radius of Jupiter, R J , implying high temperatures deep in the planetary interior <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burrows et al. 2000)</ref>. Strong irradiation has been found to have an insulating effect on planets, slowing their cooling and contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Burrows et al. 2000)</ref>. This effect can explain radii R p ∼ (1.0 − 1.2) × R J , but is insufficient to explain the radii of a significant fraction of the population with R p ∼ (1.2 − 1.8) × R J (see Fortney 2008 for a recent review). A powerful internal heat source must be acting to prevent these planets from contracting.</p><p>Circularization of the planet's orbit by dissipation of the gravitational tide has been invoked to explain the small eccentricities of most hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rasio et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Marcy et al. 1997</ref>). Using Jupiter's inferred tidal Q = 10 5 − 10 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Yoder &amp; Peale 1981)</ref>, orbits are expected to be circular out to orbital periods P orb 1 week. Curiously, a large fraction of the population that should have been circularized in ∼Gyrs is not (Dobbs- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dixon et al. 2004;</ref>). The zero and nonzero eccentricity planets occupy the same orbital period range. Suggested explanations are tidal interaction with a rapidly rotating young star (Dobbs- <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dixon et al. 2004</ref>), perturbations from other planets, or a large range of tidal Q = 10 5 − 10 9 ( ). In the continued absence of a detectable perturber with appropriate mass and orbit to account for the observed eccentricity, a mechanism involving an isolated star and planet is needed. It is also not clear why planets with presumably similar internal structure and orbits should have such different levels of internal friction.</p><p>In the absence of direct observations, it is commonly assumed that the rotation of present day hot Jupiters is highly synchronous. This assumption is motivated by the short (∼ Myr) synchronization time using Q = 10 5 − 10 6 for the gas giant. However, despite the short expected synchronization time, hot Jupiters are particularly susceptible to develop asynchronous rotation. Gas giants are relatively frictionless compared to terrestrial planets with Q ∼ 10 − 100. Even weak opposing external torques may compete with the gravitational tide to produce asynchronous spin.</p><p>The proximity of hot Jupiters to their parent star, ∼ 10 2 times closer than Solar System giants, implies an insolation stronger by ∼ 10 4 and stellar tidal forces stronger by ∼ 10 6 . Insolation and tidal forces may then play a far more important role for close-in planets. In this paper we discuss "thermal tide torques", which are created through the interplay of stellar irradiation and gravitational tidal forces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gold &amp; Soter (1969)</ref> first applied thermal tide torques to explain the observed rotation rate of Venus. A number of more detailed studies followed (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ingersoll and Dobrovolskis 1981)</ref>. Venus resides in state of slow retrograde rotation. Gravitational tides acting alone would have synchronized Venus' spin to high precision. Furthermore, Venus' spin seems to be in resonance with Earth's orbit. Tides from Earth acting on permanent quadrupole in Venus should have a negligible effect in comparison to solar gravitational torques. The possibility that torques from solar gravitational and thermal tides nearly balance that allows a small effect such as tidal forces from Earth to have an observable effect.</p><p>Previous studies of the thermal tide have assumed a thin atmosphere on top of a solid surface, as appropriate for Venus and Earth. In addition, they have assumed that the gravitational tide is strongly dissipative (Q ∼ 10 − 100). In applying the thermal tide to close-in gas giant planets, a difference between our model and those for Venus and Earth is that we assume an optically thick atmosphere, rather than ground, completely absorbs the stellar radiation. We include flux-limited radiative diffusion of heat above and below this absorbing layer. We find thermal diffusion is crucial in order to accurately estimate the magnitude of the thermal tide, particularly for long forcing periods. In applying our results, we find that the thermal tide can affect not only the planet's spin, but also the eccentricity and radius for close-in planets.</p><p>The plan of the paper is as follows. §2 contains a qualitative discussion of why thermal tide effects are important. There, we argue that spin, eccentricity and global energetics of hot Jupiters are determined by the competition between the thermal and gravitational tides. §3 contains a detailed treatment of atmospheric response to time-dependent insolation, and the resultant quadrupole moments. Readers wishing to ignore these technical details should skip this section. Basic equations and geometry are introduced in §3.1, the heating function is expanded in a Fourier series in §3.2, temperature profiles from the nonlinear simulations are discussed in §3.3, quadrupole moments are computed in §3.4, linear perturbation equations are derived in §3.5, and analytic solutions in the high and low frequency limits are presented in §3.6 and 3.7, respectively. Applications to hot Jupiter spin, radius and eccentricity are in the following sections. Equilibrium spin frequencies are computed in §4. §5 contains tidal heating rates, and a discussion of the energetics required to power the observed radii. §6 contains eccentricity growth/decay rates due to both the thermal and gravitational tides. Our most detailed results for the simultaneous equilibria of spin rate, planetary radius and eccentricity are contained in §7. In §8 we qualitatively discuss how thermal and gravitational tidal forces may drive differential rotation which, in itself, may lead to dissipation. Summary and conclusions are presented in §9. The Appendices contains a derivation of the torque, orbital evolution rates, and tidal heating rates due to the presence of mass quadrupoles of arbitrary form, as well as the mass-radius relation and core luminosity.</p></div>

A conceptual introduction and order of magnitude estimates are given below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Induced Quadrupoles</head><p>First we summarize the gravitational tide. The stellar tidal force raises a bulge on the planet, quantified to lowest order by the quadrupole moment</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q (grav) ∼ h t R p M p R 2 p ∼ M ⋆ R 2 p R p a 3 .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here R p and M p are the radius and mass of the planet, M ⋆ is the mass of the star, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and h t ∼ R p (M ⋆ /M p )(R p /a) 3 is the height of the tide. In the absence of friction within the planet, the gravitational tide does not cause secular evolution of the orbital elements or spin. The presence of friction causes high tide to lag maximum tidal acceleration at noon and midnight. For the case of asynchronous spin, this implies that the tidal bulge is misaligned with the line joining the planet and star, as pictured in figure 1. The stellar tidal force then torques the planet by "pulling" on the projection of the quadrupole moment Q (grav) perpendicular to the star-planet line. This small lag in phase or time is conveniently parametrized by the tidal Q parameter (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Goldreich and Soter 1965)</ref>. The effective quadrupole moment contributing to secular evolution is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q (grav) sec ∼ Q (grav) Q σ n (2)</formula><p>where σ is the tidal forcing frequency and n is the orbital frequency. The factor σ/n ensures the misalignment of the tidal bulge vanishes for synchronous and circular orbits (see §3.4). The torque, N , on the planet due to this quadrupole moment scales as N ∼ n 2 Q (grav) sec . Jupiter's Q is thought to be in the range Q = 10 5 − 10 6 based on expansion of Io's orbit to form the Laplace resonance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yoder &amp; Peale 1981)</ref>. Several studies have also found that hot Jupiters should have Q = 10 5 − 10 6 to explain the circularization of their orbits on Gyr timescales (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wu 2005</ref>). These studies assume that the gravitational tide is acting alone. Here, we show that constraints on Q of extrasolar planets are complicated by the influence of the thermal tide.</p><p>Another possibility for tidal phenomena comes from intense time-dependent insolation. Time-dependence may arise either through asynchronous rotation or orbital eccentricity. For circular orbits and asynchronous spin, the diurnal forcing frequency is σ = n − Ω, where Ω is the planet's spin frequency. There is also power at the higher harmonics σ = m(n − Ω), where m is the azimuthal wavenumber. Since the diurnal component does not generate a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar tidal field, the semi-diurnal component (m = 2) dominates the torque on the planet. The magnitude of the thermal tide quadrupole is roughly (see §3.6 and 3.7)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q (th) ∼ ∆M R 2 p (σ t th ) δ (3)</formula><p>where ∆M is the mass of the atmospheric layer heated by time-dependent insolation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">t th ∼ ∆M C p T R 2 p F ⋆ ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>the exponent δ ∼ 0.5 − 1.0 and F ⋆ is the flux at the substellar point. The thermal time, t th , is the time required for the layer of mass ∆M to absorb/emit its thermal energy.</p><p>One of our principal goals is to show that for the atmospheres of interest, the thermal tide bulge leads the sub-stellar point, opposite the behavior of the dissipative gravitational tide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ingersoll &amp; Dobrovolskis (1978)</ref> made similar arguments for Venus based on two assumptions. First, the temperature of the absorbing layer lags the time of maximum heating, similar to our daily experience on Earth. Second, that fluid elements remain at roughly constant pressure. Regions of lower temperature then imply higher density and vice versa, and the high density regions ("tidal bulges") lead the sub-stellar point. In our analysis, we adopt this simplifying "constant pressure approximation." The horizontal readjustment of mass necessarily requires zonal winds. In this paper we do not solve for the wind structure; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dobrovolskis &amp; Ingersoll (1980)</ref> for the wind structure resulting from a similar calculation applied to Venus.</p><p>Both the gravitational and thermal tidal bulges can be torqued by the stellar tidal field. The angular momentum evolves due to the net torque. In spin equilibrium, the thermal and gravitational tide torques balance, in general leading to an asynchronous spin state. We estimate the ratio of quadrupole moments to be (eq.2 and 3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Q (th) Q (grav) sec ∼ n σ 1+δ ∆M M ⋆ a 3 R 3 p Q (nt th ) δ ≃ n σ 1+δ ∆M 10 −8 M p M p 10 −3 M ⋆ × a 100R p 3 Q 10 5 1 (nt th ) δ .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>This order of magnitude estimate shows that for parameters characteristic of the hot Jupiters the thermal and gravitational tide effects can be comparable. Setting eq.5 equal to unity allows one to estimate the equilibrium spin frequency since σ ∝ n − Ω.</p><p>2.2. Orbit, spin, and thermal equilibrium Gravitational tidal dissipation converts rotational and orbital energy into heat. When the gravitational tide alone acts, the end state is synchronous spin and a circular orbit. As torque equilibrium is realized in ∼ Myr, over Gyr timescales the only source of tidal heating is finite eccentricity. In the absence of an external perturbation continually pumping the eccentricity, tidal heating is limited by the initial energy reservoir in the orbit ∼ GM ⋆ M p e 2 /2a, which may be comparable to planet's binding energy for initially eccentric orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bodenheimer et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Planets with anomalously large radii but small eccentricity, such as HD 209458b with e ≃ 0.01 ( <ref type="bibr">Laughlin et al. 2005</ref>), are difficult to explain with the gravitational tide alone since the current eccentricity implies negligible tidal heating. In order to explain the large radius with transient tidal heating one has to invoke that heating ended recently, and we are observing the planet before it has had time to contract. Since contraction times for radii (1.2 − 1.8) × R J are much shorter than a Gyr, this argument requires that we observe these systems during a special time in their evolution.</p><p>Inclusion of the thermal tide qualitatively changes this picture. A steady state may be reached in which thermal and gravitational tide effects balance one another. In this scenario, gravitational tidal dissipation continues to act in the equilibrium state, due to asynchronous spin and/or eccentricity. The thermal tide forces are not inherently dissipative. However differential rotation set up in the atmosphere by opposing torques at different depths may cause significant heating.</p><p>Tangential forces applied to the thermal tide quadrupole torque the planet away from synchronous spin. In equilibrium, the thermal and gravitational tide torques on the planet are in balance, setting the equilibrium spin rate. The timescale to attain equilibrium spin is shorter than the Gyrs age for orbital periods up to several months. Radial forces from the thermal tide quadrupole act to alter the orbital eccentricity. If both the thermal and gravitational tides act to circularize the orbit, the equilibrium state is again zero eccentricity. However, the thermal tide can also pump eccentricity, opposing the gravitational tide. In that case, a balance of thermal and gravitational tides implies nonzero values for the equilibrium eccentricity. The timescale to attain equilibrium eccentricity is shorter than the age for planets with orbital periods shorter than ∼ 1 week. Lastly, in the absence of tidal heating, planets cool and contract. If tides deposit heat deep in the convective interior of the planet, a thermal equilibrium is possible in which heating of the core is balanced by outward heat loss at the radiative-convective boundary. We find thermal equilibrium is achieved on a timescale shorter than the age for orbital periods 1 week (see section 7).</p><p>The thermal tide torque is exerted on a layer near the photosphere of the stellar radiation. The depth dependence of the gravitational tide torque is uncertain as the nature of gravitational tidal dissipation is complicated and not yet fully understood. For instance, turbulent viscosity damping would mainly occur just below the radiative-convective boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Goldreich &amp; Nicholson 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wu 2005</ref>), shear layers due to "wave attractors" reside deep in the convective core <ref type="bibr">(Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goodman &amp; Lackner 2008)</ref>, and upward propagating waves generated at the tropopause may break above the photosphere <ref type="bibr">(Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2004</ref>). If the thermal and gravitational torques are not exerted at the same depth, differential rotation is induced, distinct from the usual thermally-driven circulation patterns. For simplicity, we defer effects due to differential rotation until §8.</p><p>2.3. Energetics, and implications for the lightcurve and spectrum The stellar tidal acceleration creates regions of high and low gravitational potential in the longitudinal direction. Insolation heats the fluid, and this heat can be tapped to perform work against the stellar tidal field by causing pressure gradients which move fluid from regions of low to high potential. The ultimate source of energy for tidal heating driven by the thermal tide is then the stellar radiation field. The rate of work done by the thermal tide is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">˙ E (TT) work ≃ −∆M σ m (−∇U ) · dl ≃ − σ m N (TT) , (6)</formula><p>where U is the tidal potential, σ = 2(n − Ω), m = 2, and the integral is taken along a fluid trajectory dl = R p dφˆφdφˆ dφˆφ.</p><p>Here N (TT) ≃ ∆M (−∇U ) · dl is the thermal tide torque on the heated layer. In torque equilibrium, the thermal and gravitational tide torques balance giving N (GT) = −N (TT) . The heating rate due to the gravitational tide is then</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">˙ E (GT) heat = σ m N (GT) = − σ m N (TT) = ˙ E (TT)</formula><p>work ,</p><p>showing explicitly that the work done on the atmosphere by the thermal tide is converted into heat by the gravitational tide in steady state.</p><p>Since the work done on the atmosphere is ultimately powered by the stellar radiation, the maximum power input is given by the rate of absorption of stellar flux,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˙ E max = L ⋆ R p 2a 2 1 − e 2 −1/2 = 9 × 10 28 erg s −1 R p R J 2 L ⋆ L ⊙ × M ⊙ M ⋆ 2/3 4 days P orb 4/3 1 − e 2 −1/2 (8)</formula><p>where L ⋆ is the stellar luminosity and P orb = 2π/n is the orbital period. We will show in §5 that the efficiency of converting stellar flux to heat by gravitational tidal dissipation is as high as ∼ 1 − 10%, and increases toward the star. Some of the heat deposited by insolation is converted into work, leading to less thermal energy immediately re-radiated back out into space. In the (unphysical) limit of 100% efficient conversion of heat to work, and no subsequent conversion of kinetic energy back into heat, the atmosphere would be far cooler than the equilibrium temperature, and the thermal emission from the planet would be solely due to the flux coming out from the core. In torque equilibrium, the work done on the atmosphere by the thermal tide is converted into heat by the gravitational tide. We presume the gravitational tide dissipation occurs in the convective core, and entropy is efficiently mixed throughout. The temperature profile as a function of depth, latitude and longitude may then differ markedly from the case with no tidal heating.</p><p>First consider the change in the lightcurve for thermal radiation. For small flux from the core, and short thermal time in the absorbing layer, there will be a large day-night temperature difference. If, for example, 1% of the insolation is deposited in the core by the gravitational tide, then the day-night temperature ratio is (F core /F ⋆ ) 1/4 ∼ 0.01 1/4 ∼ 0.3, where F core is the flux emerging from the convective core. For small F core , the only possibility of high temperature on the night side is redistribution of heat by zonal winds. Tidal dissipation generating a large F core provides an alternative means to reduce the day-night temperature contrast (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure  11</ref> for the luminosity exiting the core versus planetary radius).</p><p>A change in the vertical distribution of heat sources also affects the vertical temperature profile at the depths where the spectrum is formed. Depositing heat in the core rather that at the photosphere leads to a radiative flux more constant with depth near the photosphere. This alteration of the temperature profile may in principle be imprinted on the spectrum.</p></div>

Differential rotation will be discussed in §8. We will work in a non-rotating coordinate system whose origin is at the center of the planet, and whose axes are fixed with respect to distant observers. Spherical polar coordinates (θ, φ) are used, where the star orbits at the equator with a colatitude θ = π/2 and longitude φ = Φ(t), and a fixed point on the planet rotates with angular frequency ˙ φ = Ω. The derivative comoving with the planet is then d/dt = ∂/∂t + Ω∂/∂φ. The cosine of the angle χ between the vertical and the vector to the star is cos χ = sin θ cos(φ − Φ). The day side is over the angular range −π/2 ≤ φ − Φ ≤ π/2. Let z be the altitude above some appropriate reference level and y(z) = ∞ z dz ′ ρ(z ′ ) the mass column above that altitude. The atmosphere is treated as being both thin and in hydrostatic balance, hence the pressure P = gy, where the surface gravity is g = GM p /R 2 p . We use an approximate treatment of radiative transport in which the time-dependent insolation is treated as a specified heat source. We approximate the transfer of thermal radiation by flux-limited diffusion. For the thermal radiation, we employ the solar composition "condensed" phase Rosseland opacities of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Allard et al. (2001)</ref>, which include the effect of grains in the equation of state, but ignores their opacity, as is appropriate if the grains have rained out to higher depth. There is a prominent dip in κ along isobars centered around T = 2000 K. This feature will be apparent in our numerical results.</p><p>We use the equation of state from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref>, with 70% hydrogen and 30% helium by mass. At low density, this is an ideal gas equation of state P = ρk b T /µm p , where ρ is the mass density, T is the temperature, m p is the proton mass, k b is Boltzmann's constant, and µ ≃ 2.4 is the mean molecular weight for a mixture of molecular hydrogen and helium.</p><p>The temperature and flux are found by solution of the heat equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C p dT dt = ∂F ∂y + ǫ<label>(9)</label></formula><p>and the equation for flux-limited diffusion</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F = 16σ sb T 3 Λ κ ∂T ∂y .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Here C p ≃ 7k b /2µm p is the specific heat per gram, and ǫ is the heating rate per gram. Since column, or equivalently pressure, is assumed constant for fluid elements, the thermodynamic relation ds/C p = dT /T − ∇ ad dP/P is simplified to T ds = C p dT . We ignore vertical fluid motion relative to constant pressure surfaces, as well as horizontal motions relative to the mean rate Ω. The quantity Λ is the flux limiter, which allows a smooth transition between the optically thick regime, Λ = 1/3, and the optically thin regime Λ → 0. For convenience, we use the limiter prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Levermore &amp; Pomraning (1981)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Λ = 2 + R 6 + 3R + R 2<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where R = (4/κ)|∂ ln T /∂y| is the ratio of photon mean free path to temperature scale height. The boundary conditions are (1) the radiation free streams at small optical depths, F ≃ 4σ sb T 4 , and (2) F → F core at large y, where F core is the thermal flux that emerges from the convective core. We refer to direct solutions of eq.9 and 10 as "nonlinear solutions", as temperature changes are not assumed to be small. The nonlinear solutions will be compared to solutions of the linearized equations which are valid only for small temperature changes.</p><p>To numerically solve eq.9 and 10, we adapted the code of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Piro et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Discussion of temperature profiles</head><p>Figures 2 and 3 show temperature versus pressure over one diurnal forcing period for a planet in circular orbit around a solar-type star. The orbital period is P orb = 4 days and the spin period P spin = 3 days, giving a diurnal forcing period of 12 days. Each curve is labeled by phase in the heating cycle, where noon means heating is maximum, etc. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates a heating function which extends "deep", down to a base pressure P base = g/κ ⋆ = 10 5.5 dyne cm −2 , while figure 3 shows "shallow" heating down to P base = g/κ ⋆ = 10 3.5 dyne cm −2 . Naively one may have expected the temperature to change significantly only above P base . This is approximately true for the deep heating case. The shallow heating case, however, shows large temperature perturbations extending a factor of ∼ 30 deeper in pressure than P base . Heating below P base is due to diffusion, rather than direct absorption of stellar radiation. We will show that there are two limits for the forcing period. In the "high frequency limit", appropriate for planets at large separation from the star, the temperature perturbations are large only for depths P P base . In the "low .-Temperature versus pressure over one diurnal forcing period for "deep" forcing at the equator (θ = π/2). Note the lag between maximum forcing (at noon) and maximum temperature (between noon and 3pm), and also the pronounced "bump" near the base of the heated layer at P base = g/κ⋆ = 10 5.5 dyne cm −2 . This plot was produced using the nonlinear simulations for a circular orbit with P orb = 4 days, super-synchronous rotation P spin = 3 days, κ⋆ = 10 −2.5 cm 2 g −1 , g = 10 3 cm s −2 , Fcore = 10 4 erg cm −2 s −1 and a solar type star. Noon is the time of maximum heating. The base of the heated layer is now at P base = g/κ⋆ = 10 3.5 dyne cm −2 . The temperature perturbations diffuse significantly below the base of the layer directly heated. Here the forcing period, 2π/σ, is large in comparison to the thermal time t th at y κ −1 ⋆ giving temperature maximum in phase with the maximum heating at noon. A thermal diffusion wave penetrates to large depths, and lags in phase with respect to the temperature at y κ −1 ⋆ . This lag in phase leads to a torque that attempts to increase the spin of the planet.</p><p>frequency limit", appropriate for close-in planets, temperature perturbations have time to diffuse down below P base , so that the star torques a layer deeper than that directly heated by the stellar radiation.</p><p>The "bump" in the temperature profiles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 2</ref> at P = 10 5.0 − 10 6.2 dyne cm −2 is evidence of an inwardly propagating thermal diffusion wave. This bump is also seen in temperature profiles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">figure 5</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Showman et al. (2008)</ref>, although the authors do not identify this feature as such. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Showman et al. (2008)</ref> have a far more detailed solution method, including nonlinear three-dimensional hydrodynamics, angle and frequency dependent radiative transfer, and detailed chemical abundances and monochromatic opacities. That our solutions are in qualitative and rough quantitative agreement in the region of interest lends confidence to our results.</p><p>Another important comparison to the more rigorous results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Showman et al. (2008)</ref> concerns the lag in the temperature profile, shown in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>. Although their simulation is of a synchronous planet, they generate a super-rotating equatorial jet which mimics the supersynchronous rotation in our results. Those authors indeed find the temperature reaches a maximum eastward of the subsolar point; maximum temperature lags maximum heating. This lag is especially prominent at large depth (their bottom panel). We regard this as strong evidence that, while inclusion of fluid motion may alter our results quantitatively, the qualitative result that temperature lags, due to thermal inertia, is in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Showman et al. (2008)</ref>. A crucial omission in their simulations is that the tidal force from the star is not included. We argue, based on the temperature lag seen in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3</ref>, that the torque on this thermallygenerated quadrupole will act to generate asynchronous spin. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the thermal flux exiting the surface, in units of the average thermal flux, for the two cases shown in figures 2 and 3. The shallow heating case shows larger flux variations and smaller lag time in comparison to the deep heating case. In both cases, the maximum in thermal emission lags the maximum in heating (at noon) due to thermal inertia. The Spitzer lightcurves for HD 189733b show maximum thermal emission just before secondary eclipse. Using the geometry from <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>, maximum emission occurs just before secondary eclipse for a planet with super-synchronous rotation, in order that the temperature reaches maximum to the east of the subsolar point, after it has passed through noon. A similar effect would occur for a super-synchronous zonal wind, as in the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Showman et al. (2008)</ref>.</p><p>One technical point about flux-limited diffusion is that it produces temperature profiles which increase inward at small optical depth. The "greenhouse" case shown in figure 2 is captured in our solutions. Recall that greenhouse heating is due to κ ⋆ ≪ κ; stellar irradiation deposits heat at large optical depth, leading to a temperature increase by a factor ∼ (κ/κ ⋆ ) 1/4 above the skin temperature (F ⋆ /4σ sb ) 1/4 . There has been recent interest in shallow heating, κ ⋆ ≫ κ, due to TiO/VO absorption at P ∼ mbar, producing an inwardly decreasing temperature profile, the "stratosphere" case ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>). To model this effect would require angle and frequency-dependent solution of the transfer equations, beyond the scope of this paper. We note, however, that below P base , the stratosphere case is expected to have temperature ∼ (F ⋆ /σ sb ) 1/4 , similar to our results with flux-limited diffusion. Since the torque is applied well below P base , we expect our results to be qualitatively, and perhaps quantitatively correct.</p></div>

There is no time for diffusion to transport heat, the ∂F/∂y term in eq.9 is small, and the temperature fluctuates solely due to the time-dependent heating. A longer forcing period leads to larger input of heat, and effective column Σ ∝ P f , where P f = 2π/|σ| is the forcing period. An analytic solution will be presented in §3.6.

For pressures P 10 6 dyne cm −2 , the first term in eq.9 can be ignored due to the small forcing frequency. In this limit, the atmosphere responds in phase to the forcing, changing quasistatically from one equilibrium to another. No torque is exerted on the atmosphere in this limit since the temperature perturbation is in phase with the heating function. That is, for the semi-diurnal mode, temperature maxima occur at noon and midnight, while temperature minima take place at sunrise and sunset. In this "σ = 0" limit, we can solve for the (real) temperature perturbation by integrating eq.9 with dT /dt = 0. In this regime, the thermal inertia of the material is small is comparison to the amount of photon energy absorbed per cycle and therefore, the temperature is "locked" to the heating function. For the forcing frequencies of interest, this limit will always be invalid sufficiently deep in the envelope, at which point the solution is well described by a diffusion wave. This wave is apparent in <ref type="figure">figure 8</ref> in the region P = 10 6 − 10 7 dyne cm −2 , where the real and imaginary parts are comparable, and exhibit oscillations. The first and second terms in eq. 9 are comparable for diffusion waves below the base of the heating layer.

Close to the star, where the gravitational tide is large, the equilibrium spin must be in the long forcing period limit, and far from the star, where the gravitational torque is small, the equilibrium spin must be in the short forcing period limit. The dividing line between these two limits depends on factors such as stellar flux, opacities and tidal Q.</p><p>Unless ∂T /∂y = T /y, the "diffusion depth", y diff , differs from the often-used "cooling depth", y cool = F/(C p T |σ|). See the lower panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">figure 6</ref> for a numerical example. In the problem at hand, y cool and y diff can differ by orders of magnitude, especially at small optical depths and below the base of the heating layer where the flux drops exponentially. Physically, y cool is the depth down to which the heat content can be radiated in the timescale 2π/|σ|. In the absence of heating, the flux tends to become constant with depth for y y cool (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Piro et al. 2005</ref>).

Analytic solution in the low frequency limit: σ t th ≪ 1 We now consider the low frequency limit σt th ≪ 1, in which the thermal time in the layer directly heated by insolation (y κ −1 ⋆ ) is short compared to the forcing period. The small thermal inertia of the absorbing layer implies that temperature perturbations are large and in phase with the forcing, with corresponding density perturbations 180 • out of phase with the insolation, implying that the torque is zero. There will always be a layer at y κ −1 ⋆ sufficiently deep that the thermal time becomes longer than the forcing period, and the temperature perturbation in this deep layer will be out of phase, yielding a torque.</p><p>To illustrate this, we divide the atmosphere into two separate plane-parallel layers, as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The stellar flux is absorbed in the upper layer at a column y ∼ κ −1 ⋆ , and generates an outward flux of thermal radiation. In the lower layer, the stellar flux is negligible, and time-dependent temperature perturbations can only penetrate this layer due to thermal diffusion.  <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Cartoon depicting time-dependent heating in the limit where the forcing period, 2π/σ, is large in comparison to the thermal time t th of the absorption layer. The temperature of the absorption layer is approximately "locked" to the time-varying insolation such that the maxima in temperature take place at noon for diurnal heating and noon and midnight for semi-diurnal heating. However, a thermal diffusion wave penetrates to a column depth y ∼ y diff = κ −1 * / √ σ t th . As expected for a thermal diffusion wave, the temperature fluctuation at y ∼ y diff lags the temperature fluctuation in the absorption layer by π/4 in phase, which ultimately allows the heated layers to couple to the semi-diurnal tidal field in such a way as to increase its spin angular momentum.</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">y ≃ κ −1 * / √ σ t th</formula><p>The thermal time in the upper layer is short, and the time derivative term in eq. 32 can be set to zero. The temperature profile changes quasi-statically in response to changes in the heating rate. As an analytic example, consider a flux profile F (y) = F 0 exp(−κ ⋆ y) and constant opacities κ and κ ⋆ ≪ κ. The temperature deep in the layer is then T ≃ (3κF 0 /4σ sb κ ⋆ ) 1/4 .

As result, the gravitational tidal field cannot apply a torque to the the thermal tidal bulge induced in the upper layer in the σt th ≪ 1 limit. Direct heating is negligible in the lower layer, and δǫ in eq. 32 may be set to zero. Therefore, the temperature perturbation is determined by a source-free diffusion equation subject to the boundary condition in eq.44 at y = κ −1 ⋆ . The background temperature T is roughly constant below y = κ −1 ⋆ , and we assume constant opacity κ for simplicity.

Combining the results from §3.6 and this section, we find generically that the semi-diurnal component of Σ, and hence the quadrupole moments, have the opposite phase as the gravitational tide quadrupole moments.

For evolution only under the gravitational tide, such rapid spin rates occur only for young, rapidly rotating planets. Synchronization occurs on a timescale shorter than the circularization time by ∼ 10 3 , so that negligible eccentricity is excited in the early spin down phase. However, taking into account both gravitational and thermal tide torques, §4 shows that significant deviations from synchronous rotation occur in the steady state, over the entire life of the system.

While the radius is similar to the that of the super-synchronous solution, the spin and eccentricity differ. The (m, k) = (2, 1) resonance is weaker than the (m, k) = (2, 3) resonance due to the prefactor in eq.69, and eccentricity is driven less strongly than the super-synchronous case. At the evenly spaced orbital periods used, we did not get close enough to the resonance for the driving to be significant. The spin period becomes large for long orbital period, and will eventually turn into retrograde spin.</p><p>Although not plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 14</ref>, we found additional finite eccentricity solutions for P orb 6 days, where e = 0 is also a solution. We have not thoroughly investigated large e equilibria which cannot be found from a small starting guess for e. We leave this for a future investigation, but note that many equilibria may be possible due to higher order thermal tide resonances that become important for large e. The ability to trap the orbit into one of these resonances during evolution will require a more detailed numerical investigation.</p><p>We now discuss how the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 14</ref> would change for different parameters. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure 11</ref>, increasing M p leads to larger cooling rates at fixed R p . To bring heating (∝ R 4 p ) and cooling (∝ M p R 8−16 p ) back into balance requires that higher mass planets must have smaller radii, and vice versa for lower mass planets. For smaller Q ′ p (larger gravitational tide dissipation rate), the planet must be further from the star before significant asynchronous spin develops. This pushes the strong resonance driving eccentricity further from the star (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 13)</ref>, with a drop in the magnitude of the driving rate. Increasing F ⋆ (a) and e, and decreasing κ ⋆ , acts to increase the strength of the thermal tide, pushing the spin away from synchronous and the region of γ e &gt; 0 closer to the star where γ e is larger.</p><p>Our calculations are successful from the point of view that we have identified a powerful internal heat source which may explain the large radii observed for the transiting planets. However, our theory predicts a correlation of radius with orbital period, and nonzero eccentricity over a small range in orbital period. The plots of R p and e versus P orb for the observed transiting planets do not clearly show the simple behavior found in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 14</ref>. We speculate that part of the variance is due to differences in planet mass, stellar flux and heating depth (κ ⋆ ) associated with the TiO/VO transition. Furthermore, our radii are upper limits, as we do not include a core. We intend to make more detailed comparison to data in a future investigation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We investigated the role of thermal tides in shortorbital period gas giant exoplanets, the hot Jupiters. Our investigation consisted of two parts. We computed the time-dependent temperature and density perturbations in radiative atmospheres. We then applied these results for the thermal tide, and the Darwin-Hut theory of the gravitational tide, to compute spin, radius and eccentricity evolution.</p><p>Previous investigations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ingersoll &amp; Dobrovolskis 1978)</ref> for the case of Venus considered a shallow atmosphere bounded by ground at the base. In considering the thermal tide in hot Jupiters, we used radiative heat transport, and allowed incoming stellar radiation to be fully absorbed in the atmosphere. We computed the temperature perturbations in the atmosphere resulting from time-dependent insolation in order to estimate the induced thermal tide quadrupole moment. As shown in in the context of Venus, in the high frequency limit, the thermal tidal bulge leads the subsolar point <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ingersoll &amp; Dobrovolskis 1978)</ref>. In considering deep atmospheres, we include the effects of thermal diffusion, and found that the thermal tidal bulge still leads the substellar point for low tidal forcing frequencies, when heat can diffuse deep into the atmosphere. This result for the phase lead (for density, lag for temperature) is simplest to see in the results of nonlinear simulations in figures 2 -5. Downward going diffusion waves at the base of the heated layer are discernible in figures 2 and 8 for the low frequency limit. The effective column and quadrupole moment are summarized in analytic formula in the high and low frequency limits in eq.41, 43, 49 and 50.</p><p>In appendix A, we derive the evolutionary equations for the planet's spin and orbit, as well as tidal heating rates for arbitrary quadrupole moments. These formula as used with the thermal tide quadrupole to compute equilibrium spin rates ( §4), equilibrium tidal heating rates ( §5), the growth/damping rate of eccentricity ( §6), and simultaneous spin, orbital and thermal equilibrium ( §7).</p><p>We find, contrary to the widely held assumption, that for reasonable heating depths and tidal Q, hot Jupiters are far from a synchronous spin state (see <ref type="figure">figure 10)</ref>. At long orbital periods, the thermal tide torque dominates and the planet is highly asynchronous, while at smaller radii the gravitational tidal torque is larger, and the planet approaches a synchronous state. Direct measurements of the planetary rotation rate could confirm asynchronous rotation, although this appears difficult in the near future. Possible methods include detection of centrifugal flattening using high photometric precision transit observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Seager &amp; Hui 2002)</ref>, and Doppler shifted absorption lines for transiting planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Spiegel et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A more promising route to observationally constrain rotation rates at the moment may be through the indirect effect of planetary rotation on zonal winds, and the resulting change in phase of maximum thermal emission in Spitzer infrared observations. We have found, for uniform rotation, that flux perturbations are smaller in magnitude and have longer lag times in the high frequency limit than in the low frequency limit (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 4</ref>). The strength of zonal winds is expected to decrease for more rapid rotation rate as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Showman et al. 2008</ref>). Hydrodynamic simulations of global circulation already contain the thermal tide quadrupole moment. "Turning on" the stellar tidal force in these simulations will torque the surface layer as described in §8, leading to spinup of the atmosphere, as well as momentum-driven circulation pattens in addition to the usual thermally-driven circulation. As argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goodman (2008)</ref>, a source of dissipation such as that due to the gravitational tide or viscous friction is necessary to damp kinetic energy added to the atmosphere, and may affect steady-state wind speeds.</p><p>In §5, gravitational tidal dissipation due to asynchronous spin is shown to yield large steady state heating rates, sufficient in magnitude to power the large observed radii over the range R p = (1.2 − 1.8) × R J if the heat is deposited in the convective core. §8 shows that vertical shearing in the wind profiles between the layers torqued by the thermal and gravitational tides may also give heating rates large enough to alter the atmospheric temperature profiles, and perhaps slow the cooling of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bodenheimer et al. 2001</ref>).</p><p>In §6 we show that the thermal tide is capable of driving eccentricity. We compute the growth rate of eccentricity, in the limit of small eccentricity, finding narrow windows in orbital period in which the eccentricity is driven, while outside these windows it is even more strongly damped than for the gravitational tide alone. There are two consequences. As pointed out by , a puzzle exists as to why all hot Jupiter orbits are not highly circular. It is observed that ∼ 25% of hot Jupiters have eccentricities e ≥ 0.1.  argue that this must imply the planets with eccentric orbits have far larger Q than planets with circular orbits. Including the thermal tide, we find that it is expected that narrow windows in orbital period should exist in which eccentricity is driven to large values. This may explain the puzzling mix of zero and nonzero eccentricities in the observed planets. As a corollary, one cannot simply constrain the gravitational tidal Q, since it's effects are mixed in with the thermal tide effect. In some ranges of orbital period they combine to cause more rapid circularization, while in other orbital period ranges they partially cancel. A more detailed study including both effects is required to place meaningful constraints on Q.</p><p>§7 shows that the timescales to achieve spin, orbital and thermal equilibrium are small or comparable to the Gyr ages of observed transiting planets. Simultaneous equilibria for spin period, radius and eccentricity are found. Radii increase strongly toward the star, mainly due to asynchronous spin, inside orbital periods of 1-2 weeks. Asynchronous spin again increases to longer orbital periods. Nonzero equilibrium values of eccentricity are found in the region where e = 0 is unstable.</p><p>In summary, this initial investigation has found that thermal tides have a significant impact on hot Jupiter rotation rates, eccentricities and thermal state, and that seemingly unrelated observation puzzles, such as large radii and nonzero eccentricities, may have a natural explanation within this model.</p></div>
