				<p>Moons of giant planets may represent an alternative to the classical picture of habitable worlds. They may exist within the circumstellar habitable zone of a parent star, and through tidal energy dissipation they may also offer alternative habitable zones, where stellar insolation plays a secondary, or complementary, role. We investigate the potential extent of stable satellite orbits around a set of 74 known extrasolar giant planets located beyond 0.6 AU from their parent stars-where moons should be long-lived with respect to removal by stellar tides. For this sample, the typical stable satellite orbital radii span a band some ∼ 0.02 AU in width, compared to the ∼ 0.12 − 0.15 AU bands for the Jovian and Saturnian systems. Approximately 60% of these giant planets can sustain satellites or moons in bands up to ∼ 0.04 AU in width. For comparison, the Galiean satellites extend to ∼ 0.013 AU. We discuss how the actual number and characteristics of satellites will depend strongly on the formation pathways. We investigate the stellar insolation that moons would experience for these exoplanet systems, and the implications for sublimation loss of volatiles. We find that between 15 and 27% of all known exoplanets may be capable of harboring small, icy, moons. In addition, some 22-28% of all known exoplanets could harbor moons within a &quot;sublimation zone&quot;, with insolation temperatures between 273 K and 170 K. A simplified energy balance model is applied to the situation of temperate moons, maintained by a combination of stellar insolation and tidal heat flow. We demonstrate that large moons (&gt; 0.1M ⊕), at orbital radii commensurate with those of the Galilean satellites, could maintain temperate, or habitable, surface conditions during episodes of tidal heat dissipation of the order 1-100 times that currently seen on Io.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Based on the example of our own solar system, giant planets appear to be excellent candidates for playing host to significant satellite and moon systems. Of particular interest is the possibility that moons may share characteristics with terrestrial type worlds, both in terms of composition and size, and in terms of thermodynamic conditions favorable to life. If a host giant planet orbits within the so-called circumstellar habitable zone then moons of mass greater than approximately 0.1M ⊕ may be able to retain a long-lived atmosphere, and sustain temperate surface conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Williams et al. 1997</ref>).</p><p>Moons may also represent an entirely new class of habitable environment owing to the potential for them to form beyond the planetary snow-line in a system and hence accumulate a significant icy mantle, and the potential for them to enter into orbital resonance conditions favorable for driving significant tidal heating and sustainable sub-surface liquid oceans (e.g. Reynolds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McKay &amp; Kasting 1987)</ref>. The latter is a direct consequence of the dynamically dense nature of moon systems. The Galilean moon Europa has served as a prototype for such objects, and it appears possible that a liquid water ocean, perhaps as deep as 100 km (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Melosh et al 2003)</ref> currently exists beneath an outer icy crust. This state is consistent with vigorous tidal heating by Jupiter due to the maintenance of an eccentric orbit (e ≃ 0.01) by the mean-motion 4 : 2 : 1 Laplacian resonance between Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Other moons in our solar system, which would otherwise be inert, also show evidence for dynamically driven heating. For example, the recent detection of water "geysers" on Enceladus in the Saturnian system (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Porco et al. (2006)</ref>) points towards a remarkably active geology, even on such a small moon. In the case of Enceladus, although it is known to be in a 1:2 mean-motion orbital resonance with the moon Dione (with a resultant orbital eccentricity of 0.0045), it appears unlikely that the resultant tidal heating by Saturn is sufficient to maintain a sub-surface ocean, although the tides may contribute to localized heating. Proximity to a librational resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wisdom 2004</ref>), together with radiogenic heating and a variety of possible internal compositions may provide the additional boost required to explain it's activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Porco et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Non-classical habitable zones such as that proposed for Europa could greatly extend the potential for biota in planetary systems by essentially decoupling from the stellar energy output (e.g.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reynolds et al. (1987)</ref>) and circumventing the mass requirement for atmospheric retention. In addition, the classical circumstellar habitable zone could conceivably be extended when the surface temperature of a satellite or moon is maintained by a combination of stellar insolation and tidal heating. In the broader context of life within a planetary system such potential habitats are of enormous interest in seeking both the origins of life and the capacity for life to survive through unfavorable circumstances. For example, not only could moons like Europa offer potential "incubators" for life, they might -through forward contamination (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gladman et al. (2006)</ref>) -offer relatively safe haven for microbial life set adrift due to cataclysmic events on inner, terrrestrial-type, worlds.</p><p>It is not unreasonable to speculate that moon and ring systems will eventually be detected using more sensitive instrumentation and current and future observational techniques. Indeed, such detections appear plausible even with current transit methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sartoretti &amp; Schneider 1999)</ref>, especially when applied to future missions such as KEPLER or COROT which may even be able to detect the signature of equivalent systems to Jupiter-Europa using eclipse timing (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Doyle &amp; Deeg (2003)</ref>). With the eventual construction of 20-30 meter class telescopes the detection during transit of massive moons and their associated atmospheres will also become significantly more feasible ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ehrenreich et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>In this paper we present an initial evaluation of the potential for a subset of currently known extrasolar giant planets to harbor satellite and moon systems. We also investigate the likely impact of stellar insolation on icy moons around these exoplanets by considering the orbital incursions within various zones of stellar insolation, the time-averaged stellar insolation, and the sublimation rates of water-ice from a moon surface. We further consider the potential combination of stellar insolation and tidal heating of moons in creating habitable environments, such as temperate moons, and examine the related constraints on system parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Satellite orbital terrain</head><p>Previous works have investigated the longevity of satellite systems due to tides and migrations, and in particular Earth-mass moons around giant planets on close orbits to the parent star <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ward &amp; Reid 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnes &amp; O'Brien 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnes &amp; O'Brien (2002)</ref> note that for parent stars with M * &gt; 0.15M ⊙ , Earth sized moons of Jovian planets can remain in stable orbits for some 5 Gyr; they also point out that beyond approximately ∼ 0.6 AU there are essentially no meaningful dynamical constraints on moon masses and survival times. Moons around such planets could therefore be both massive and long-lived.</p><p>In this present work we therefore restrict our investigation to the potential orbital ranges of stable satellite systems around known planets whose semimajor axes are a p &gt; 0.6 AU.</p><p>A simple consideration of the Hill Sphere radius; R H = a p (M p /3M * ) 1/3 (Burns 1986) from the restricted 3-body problem, leads to a broad constraint on the outer physical extent of any system in terms of the satellite semi-major axis a s . The critical semimajor axisthe location of the outermost satellite orbit that remains bound to the planet has been of R H . We use the numerical result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref> for prograde satellites which suggests a critical semi-major axis of 0.36R H . For the majority of the exoplanet systems we will consider below, the planets also have significant orbital eccentricity. We therefore modify our Hill radius estimate by conservatively considering the perihelion star-planet separation (i.e. (1 − e)a p ) in calculating the allowed satellite orbits. Similarly, a consideration of the Roche limit: d R = R s (2M p /M s ) 1/3 , where R s , M s are the satellite orbtial radius and mass respectively, provides a constraint on the inner radius of a viable satellite system, such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3M p 2πρ s 1/3 &lt; a s &lt; 0.36(1 − e p )a p M p 3M * 1/3 (1)</formula><p>where M p is the planet mass, and M * is the parent star's mass. In other words -a moon can only survive if it is far enough from the planet that it is outside the satelliteplanet Roche limit (which we subsequently label a inner s ), is not entirely disrupted, and close enough to the planet that it is within some fraction of the planet-star Hill radius (which we subsequently label a outer s ). These limits are somewhat conservative, since the Roche limit is strictly true only for liquid or "rubble-like" objects, solid objects can in principle survive closer in to the host planet. It is interesting to note that, given the observables M p (typically modulo sini), a p , e p , and M * (from stellar modeling), the only variable which remains to determine the range of a s is the satellite density ρ s .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The planet sample</head><p>The sample used here has been compiled from both the on-line catalog from the Geneva Extrasolar planet search programme 1 , and that of the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopedia 2 both of which are themselves compilations of detections. We have extracted planet candidates (including multiple systems) with semi-major orbital axes &gt; 0.6 (see above) and measured eccentricities. We have then compiled the planet orbital data with the parent star masses estimated from stellar models, cited in the on-line catalog. The final sample used here (at the time of writing) consists of 74 planets, 13 of which are known to be in multiple planet systems -excluding these objects does not alter our conclusions.</p><p>For all planets we use the estimated Msini as a direct surrogate for true mass, ignoring therefore any systematics which bias the sample towards low inclination systems, or the scatter introduced by the (presumed) random distribution of inclinations. Even allowing for a 50% (i = 30 • ) underestimate of M p our conclusions are not significantly altered.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> we plot the number of systems with a given range of a s ; a outer s − a inner s , which we refer to as the allowed satellite orbital radii or band, estimated from Equation 1. We have assumed here a mean satellite density (ρ s ) of 3 g cm −3 , commensurate with the upper-mid range of densities seen in the Galilean satellites (Io -3.55 g cm −3 , Europa -3.04 g cm −3 , Ganymede -1.93 g cm −3 , Callisto -1.83 g cm −3 )</p><p>For this sample the most frequently occurring band is ∼ 0.02 AU, and ∼ 60% of the giant planets have bands less than 0.04 AU in width. For comparison we also indicate in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> the allowed bands for the Jovian and Saturnian systems: 0.122 and 0.148 AU respectively. We also note that, for example, the Galilean moons actually occupy only the inner 10% of the allowed Jovian orbital terrain and that it is the irregular, smaller, satellites which occupy the outermost stable orbits. The narrowest allowed band in our sample is approximately 0.0088 AU (for the planet HD45350b which has Msini = 0.98 M J , a p = 1.77 AU and the highest eccentricity in our sample: e = 0.78).</p><p>These results should not be surprising, the exoplanet sample is strongly biased towards planets with semi-major axes smaller than those of the giant planets in our own solar system. It does raise the issue however of what the impact on moon populations is of a reduced total orbital terrain. We discuss this in §7 below</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Tidal heating, stellar insolation, and boosted temperatures</head><p>We address three questions: First, what the potential is for Europa-analog moons in the current exoplanet sample, i.e. icy moons beyond the water sublimation line, which are tidally heated to levels commensurate with the presence of subsurface liquid oceans. Second, what the present stellar insolation is for hypothetical moons in this exoplanet sample, and what the implications are for the surface environments and retention of volatiles. Third, since we find that some ∼ 50% of the sample could harbor moons warmer than 170 K, but not in the liquid-water zone we investigate the requirements for boosting temperatures through tidal heating to attain surface equilibrium temperatures 273 &lt; T eq &lt; 373 K. For this latter question we assume that the moons must be massive enough to retain a significant atmosphere.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Potential Tidal Heating</head><p>We here consider in very simple terms the potential tidal heating for moons due to the simplest type of mean motion orbital resonance. For a satellite or moon in a non-zero eccentricity orbit ( maintained by orbital resonances with other moons -c.f. Io, Europa and Ganymede, or via resonances with the host planet orbit, see §8) the rate of tidal dissipation ( ˙ E), assuming Keplerian motion, synchronous rotation, and zero obliquity, may be written in terms of the surface heat flow (H T ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">H T = ˙ E 4πR 2 s = 21 38 G 5/2 ρ 2 s R 5 s µQ e 2 s M p a 3 s 5/2 (2)</formula><p>where µ is the satellite elastic rigidity (assumed uniform), Q is the satellite specific dissipation function, R s the satellite radius and e s the satellite orbital eccentricity, which is assumed to be small (see e.g., ). This may be re-written in terms of the satellite mass M s as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H T = 21 38 G 5/2 µQ 3 4π 5/3 e 2 s ρ 1/3 s a 15/2 s M 5/3 s M 5/2 p (3)</formula><p>For a given H T it is therefore possible to place a constraint on the maximum satellite orbital radius where such heating might occur, given the planet mass and the satellite mass, density, orbital eccentricity and composition. In order to calibrate this relationship in a large potential parameter space we first choose a specific question, namely; what the potential extent of the zone is around the planet candidates within which an icy, Europa mass moon (≃ 0.008M ⊕ ), might be heated to levels commensurate to those estimated for Europa. These levels are therefore assumed to be reasonable for maintaining and/or generating subsurface liquid water oceans.</p><p>We assume that such a moon has an orbital eccentricity commensurate with that of Europa e ≃ 0.01, an icy composition and rigidity µ ≃ 4 × 10 10 dyne cm −2 (appropriate to ice at temperatures near 100K, c.f. ) and Q ≃ 100, similar to that of solid materials on Earth. We note that the rigidity of a solid, silicate, rock is a few 10 11 dyne cm −2 . If a rock-like rigidity was assumed then the results presented in this section and those following would not be significantly altered beyond factors of 1.4-4 due to lower values of H T for a given configuration. In no case would our conclusions be significantly altered. Given both the very considerable uncertainty in other factors, and the varying values of µ used in the literature, we choose the lower, ice rigidity in what follows.</p><p>We further assume a density ρ s = 3 g cm −3 . Estimates of the actual tidal dissipation in Europa are of course subject to significant uncertainty, however surface heat flows of between H T ≃ 300 ergs s −1 cm −2 and H T ≃ 50 ergs s −1 cm −2 have been estimated in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cassen et al. 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cassen et al. , 1980</ref>. Such flows are broadly consistent with the known system parameters and with the hypothesis of a tidally sustained sub-surface liquid ocean. For comparison, on Io, the surface heat flow due to tides is estimated to be ≃ 1500 ergs s −1 cm −2 .</p><p>The orbital radii at which such a moon would have to be in order to experience tidal heating greater than, or equal to 50 − 300 ergs s −1 cm −2 is then estimated. The number of systems versus the difference between these radii and the innermost stable orbit (a inner s ), is plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. For the outer exoplanet sample it is clear that the physical orbital range for such a moon is commensurate with that of the Jovian system, despite the range of host planet masses, although in some cases can be a factor 2 larger. In all cases the inner allowed orbit (a inner s ) is less than 0.001 AU. Furthermore, in all systems these levels of tidal heating can be achieved for orbital radii well within the allowed maximum orbits of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. For a given surface heat flow the required satellite orbit a s ∝ M 2/9 s . Clearly then, even an Earth-mass moon would reside only a factor ∼ 3 times further from the host planet (assuming all other parameters remain fixed) to attain the same levels of heating as assumed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Only a small fraction of the exoplanet sample used here (∼ 3%) would not be able to retain such a moon in a stable orbit. In addition, as described in §5 below, those systems are also those within stellar insolation zones likely unsuitable for icy covered moons with subsurface oceans. Thus, the reduced satellite orbital terrain in this exoplanet sample (compared to that of the Jovian systems) does not appear to limit the potential tidal heating required to sustain putative sub-surface oceans on icy moons. Nor does it force such moons to be heated to greater levels, which might result in the loss of volatiles (c.f. Io).</p><p>However, if the reduced stable satellite terrain results in a lower likelihood of the presence of large, icy moons then it remains an open question as to whether the exoplanets in the sample are more or less likely to harbor tidally heated moons. We discuss some of these issues in more detail in §7 below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Stellar insolation and moon conditions</head><p>Hayashi <ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref> introduced the idea of a planetary snow-line in a proto-stellar/protoplanetary disk as the distance from the system center at which the local disk gas temperature drops below 170 K, which is the characteristic, zero-pressure, sublimation temperature for water ice. Icy moons must almost certainly form beyond this snow-line in a proto-planetary disk system and beyond the local snow-line within the circumplanetary disk of the forming host planet. The precise location of the planetary snow line in our own solar system is still unclear, indeed it has been suggested that it may have been as small as ∼ 1 AU for a dusty disk, compared to the often quoted distance of 4 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sasselov &amp; Lecar 2000)</ref>.</p><p>However, a giant planet hosting formed or forming moons with significant icy mantles may migrate inwards to a final orbit which passes within the planetary snow-line, and/or the later main sequence evolution of the parent star may result in the water sublimation-line (socalled to distinguish it from the snow-line in a proto-planetary disk) eventually intersecting the planet/moon orbit. In this context it is appropriate to evaluate the present conditions experienced by potential moon systems around known exoplanets.</p><p>Specifically there are several classes of conditions that "water rich" exomoons could experience, based on sublimation temperatures (170 K), and temperatures commensurate with liquid surface water at one atmosphere pressure (273-373 K) which are typically considered representative of "habitable" conditions for life. These classes can be defined as:</p><p>• An orbit, or incursions, within the "vapor line", where stellar insolation would produce a mean surface temperature in excess of 373 K.</p><p>• An orbit, or incursions, within a stellar insolation zone resulting in mean surface temperatures between 273 and 373 K where, for a massive moon retaining a significant atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. 1997</ref>), liquid surface water could exist, or for a less massive moon, volatile loss would be rapid. We label this as the "liquid water" zone rather than the circumstellar habitable zone.</p><p>• An orbit, or incursions, within a stellar insolation zone resulting in mean surface temperatures between 170 and 273 K, where significant water-ice sublimation will occur, with subsequent volatile loss for lower mass moons unable to retain an atmosphere.</p><p>• An orbit, or incursions, within a stellar insolation zone resulting in mean surface temperature less than 170 K, where water-ice sublimation is significantly reduced.</p><p>By limiting our exoplanet sample to systems with a p ≥ 0.6 AU we naturally avoid planets which spend substantial time within the inner "vapor-line" (see below).</p><p>In order to make an initial estimate of the orbital radius at which stellar insolation produces a given surface temperature we follow the classical prescription for estimating the equilibrium surface temperature of a fast-rotating body, namely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T eq = (1 − A B )L * 16πǫσd 2 1/4 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where A B is the Bond albedo, L * the parent stellar luminosity, and d the distance from the parent star. The factor ǫ is a crude, first-order, correction in the case where an atmosphere is assumed (for zero-atmosphere ǫ = 1). It incorporates the infrared optical depth, and for a present-day Earth-type atmosphere ǫ ≃ 0.62 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">McGuffie &amp; Henderson-Sellers (2005)</ref>). The fast-rotating approximation should be a fair one when applied to moons of giant planets aligned with the system orbital plane, since while they should have synchronous spin-orbits (as is the case for the Galilean satellites) the combination of their orbital period with that of their host planet will typically result in rapidly changing, and generally uniform insolation across the moon surfaces. For moon systems at significant inclination to the system plane there is the potential for much more static stellar insolation, we have not considered this situation, but note that the slow-rotating T eq is only a factor of √ 2 larger than that for a fast-rotating body.</p><p>We have also examined the potential eclipse, or shadowing, times of moons by the host planet, assuming all moon orbits lie in the planetary system plane. These range from ∼ 12% to ∼ 0.1% of the total moon orbital period, for close-in (a inner s ) and outer (a outer s ) moons respectively. In the case of close-in moons (as defined by Equation 1) the actual shadow time is typically ∼ 20 minutes, compared to ∼ 5 hours for the outermost allowed moons in the sample. We therefore ignore this effect in considering the first-order, long term, impact of stellar insolation on moon and satellite systems.</p><p>A major source of uncertainty is whether or not an atmosphere is included in the estimation of surface conditions. Since we are first concerned here with the potential vacuum sublimation of surface volatiles, and the impact on moon characteristics, we assume zeroatmosphere conditions and set ǫ = 1. Stellar luminosities are compiled for our exoplanet sample from the on-line catalog and sources described in §2. Where luminosities are not directly available we have estimated them using the reported optical magnitudes and distances. The total range is 0.29 &lt; L * /L ⊙ &lt; 4.59 with a mean of 1.66L ⊙ . We then compute the orbital ranges for T eq &lt; 170 K, 170 K&lt; T eq &lt; 273 K, 273 &lt; T eq &lt; 373 K, and T eq &gt; 373 K, assuming albedo's of either A B = 0.68, commensurate with that of Europa, or 0.3 commensurate with that of a mixed surface, such as the Earth. As described above, we have not included the effect of an atmosphere on T eq .</p><p>The orbital parameters (a p , e, P ) of the sample exoplanets are used to evaluate the amount of time each planet spends within a given zone, and to evaluate time averaged fluxes and temperatures. In both cases we are effectively assuming no time latency in reaching an With an assumed moon albedo A B = 0.68 then 22 of the 74 sample planets spend time within the zone of 273 &lt; T &lt; 373 K. Of these, two also spend time interior to this zone, i.e. within the "vapor line". Beyond this, approximately 53% of the systems never enter the liquid-water zone and remain with T eq &lt; 273 K.</p><p>For those planets passing into, or through, the liquid-water zone there is a significant range in the amount of time actually spent in this zone, or within the vapor line. Only 1 system spends its entire orbital period with the liquid-water zone (depending on assumed albedo), and many spend less than 30% of their orbit within this zone, with actual times varying from a few days to ∼ 100 days. 73% of systems spend some time in the outer "sublimation" zone (170 &lt; T eq &lt; 273 K), and 63% of those do not enter the liquid-water zone. Beyond these zones there are only 18 planets (24% of the sample) which always remain beyond their system sublimation-lines.</p><p>In terms of time-averaged equilibrium temperatures between 5% and 18% of systems (for albedos of 0.68 and 0.3 respectively) attain 273 &lt; T eq &lt; 373 K, and between 51% and 28% of systems remain at or below the sublimation temperature at all times <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). The remaining 43% or 54% of systems have surface temperatures which place them in what might be best termed the sublimation zone (170 K&lt; T eq &lt; 273 K) -a similar number to that determined from the simple zoning criteria above.</p><p>Allowing for atmospheres (ǫ &lt; 1) in Equation 4 would shift all insolation zone radii a outwards (e.g. by a factor ∼ 1.27 for ǫ = 0.62). However, our primary purpose here is to evaluate the impact of insolation on the icy mantle of small moons, where atmospheres may be hard to retain. We do note however that for those systems which may remain within the liquid-water zone at all times, or with an equivalent time-averaged temperature, then one would expect that if an atmosphere can be retained by a moon then substantial liquid surface water could potentially exist ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. 1997</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.0.1.">Sublimation rates &amp; volatiles loss</head><p>As described above, in vacuum the sublimation temperature for pure water ice is ∼ 170 K, and this is the physical criterion used to define the sublimation-line in a planetary system. A significant number of the exoplanets in our chosen sample spend between 10% and 100% of their orbital periods within this sublimation-line, but outside of the liquid-water line. To first order we can evaluate the effect of this on an icy mantle on associated moons by considering the upward sublimation rate of water ice at these temperatures. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Spencer (1987)</ref> we plot in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> the rate of surface lowering due to sublimation for water ice as a function of temperature. The water vapor pressure over ice is used in this calculation. This plot assumes only sublimation loss, and does not account for re-deposition of material, which at ∼ 170 K may be at rates approximately equal to those of sublimation -depending on local surface temperature variations (e.g. latudinal variation on Galilean satellites, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Spencer (1987)</ref>). What is immediately apparent is that for T eq &gt; 170 K sublimation loss rates are extremely quick -with 100km depth of water ice sublimating in only a few 10 6 years at 170 K -if there is no re-deposition.</p><p>The escape velocity from the surface of a Europa mass moon (∼ 0.0082M ⊕ ) is ∼ 2 km s −1 , compared to a mean velocity of a water molecule in a gas at 170 K of ∼ 0.4 km s −1 . Applying the thermal (Jeans) escape methodology (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lammer et al. (2004)</ref>) then the typical flux of escaping gas particles at these temperatures is at least a factor 10 8 lower than that for gas in the exosphere of a large moon with 1000 K temps (e.g. similar to the Martian exosphere). Thus, thermal escape appears unlikely to be a dominant mechanism for material loss in cold moons beyond the sublimation line, and even up to the ice-line at 273 K. However, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. (1997)</ref> describe, sputtering by charged particles trapped within the magnetosphere of the giant planet host is likely to be a highly efficient loss mechanism for moons -if they do not have protective magnetic fields. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. (1997)</ref> further suggest that moons of mass &lt; 0.1 M ⊕ , without magnetic fields, at any distance from the parent star will have a hard time retaining an atmosphere for as long as a billion years.</p><p>Thus, it appears reasonable to speculate that small (&lt; 0.1M ⊕ ) icy moons which spend significant time within the sublimation-line are likely to lose sublimated material and eventually all surface volatiles over relatively short timescales. The major caveat to this statement is that if a small moon with a host planet in such an orbital configuration has a strong magnetic field it might retain a cold atmosphere of volatiles, and their dissociated atomic species over longer timescales.</p><p>For our current sample of exoplanets, and the zones occupied as described in §5, between 49% and 72% of these systems are such that small moons are unlikely to have retained any surface water from an icy mantle -if they initially had one. Thus, we can re-evaluate our estimate of the potential for small, tidally heated "Europa-like" moons to restrict ourselves to those beyond the sublimation line. As seen in §5 this would result in some 28-51% of our current sample of exoplanets being capable of harboring small, icy, moons with the potential for tidally heated subsurface oceans. In terms of all currently known exoplanets (i.e. including those within 0.6 AU of their parent star) this corresponds to 15-27% of the total population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Tidally boosted temperatures</head><p>An intriguing possibility, raised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reynolds et al. (1987)</ref>, is that a combination of stellar insolation and tidal heating act to raise the surface temperature of a moon to within the classically habitable range. The range of stellar insolation seen around the above sample of exoplanets is also motivation for examining this possibility, since many planets are only just beyond the liquid water zone of their parent stars. To examine this we make a very naive assumption that the equilibrium temperature of an object's surface -where we define the surface as some ad hoc layer of outer material -is that of a pure black body receiving both an input radiation flux and an input flux from tidal heating. This condition can be written as a form of zero-order energy-balance equation;</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ǫσT 4 eq = (1 − A B ) 4 f rad + H T ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where f rad and H T are the stellar flux and tidal surface heat flow respectively. An implicit assumption is that the tidal surface heat flow (which is really just the net rate of tidal energy dissapation divided by the moon surface area) acts exactly like a radiation field. In other words the energy flux is assumed to be entirely thermalized by the object's surface. This is extremely crude, by comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Reynolds et al. (1987)</ref> employed a radiativeconvective equilibrium code to examine the impact of tidal heating on a hypothetical object similar to Titan (i.e. with a thick atmosphere). However, the differential adjustment to T eq as f tidal is varied is quite similar (within an order of magnitude) between the more sophisticated model with an atmosphere and our simplistic model, where a "greenhouse" atmosphere is incorporated via the atmospheric infrared transparency factor ǫ in Equation 5. We note as well that neither model allows for non-thermal energy dissipation -e.g. the tidal surface energy flow could equally power the bulk rearrangement of an object's surface. We therefore use the above to illustrate in the broadest terms the potential for tidal boosting.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> we present some of the constraints and potential environments discussed here in terms of the parameters M s and a p , the satellite or moon mass, and the distance from the parent star respectively. Major limits on M s and a p are indicated by shaded regions. The approximate minimum mass for retention of an atmosphere is indicated at M s = 0.1M ⊕ (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. (1997)</ref>). The limiting orbital semi-major axis below which moons will be tidally stripped on relatively short timescales is also indicated at a p = 0.6 AU (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnes &amp; O'Brien (2002)</ref>). Immediately beyond this line is the ice-line (T eq = 273 K) for an assumed 1L ⊙ parent star, an albedo A B = 0.68, and ǫ = 0.62, which occurs at 0.75 AU. The related vapor and sublimation lines are also plotted. We also plot a hypothetical upper mass limit based on the minimum mass subnebula postulated for the Jovian system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Canup &amp; Ward 2002)</ref>. The subnebula has been estimated at ∼ 2% of the final mass of Jupiter, or ∼ 6M ⊕ , and we therefore treat this as a zero order estimate of the maximum possible mass for a single moon.</p><p>Given the expression for tidal heating in Equation 3, we can substitute for a s by either the minimum allowed satellite orbital radius (a inner s ) or the outer, a outer s . In both cases the host planet mass M p cancels out and we can rearrange for M s , namely:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M inner s = 38 21 3/5 6 π 1/2 (µQ) 3/5 G 3/2 H T e 2 s ρ 17/6 s 3/5 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where we have assumed µQ = 4 × 10 12 dyne cm −2 in what follows. Similarly for the outer allowed satellite orbital radius we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M outer s = 38 21 3/5 4π 3 (µQ) 3/5 G 3/2 H T ((1 − e p )a p ) 15/2 e 2 s ρ 1/3 s (3M * ) 5/2 3/5 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>M inner s and M outer s are therefore the required moon masses at the inner and outer allowed orbital radii to generate a given H T , assuming all other parameters are fixed. It is immediately apparent that M inner s will be small for most interesting choices of parameters. Equation 7 can also be scaled for moons at arbitrary radii within the outer allowed orbital radius. Three sets of curves (dashed and solid lines) are plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> corresponding to loci of constant T eq (373 K and 273 K respectively) for moons at radii 0.1a outer s , including the effects of stellar insolation according to Equation 5 (and A B = 0.68, ǫ = 0.62). This orbital radius scaling is chosen to correspond with the approximate relative location of the Galiean satellites in the Jovian system <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. As described above, we choose ρ s = 3 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> , and from left to right increasing values of moon eccentricity: e s = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1. Zero eccentricity, e p = 0, is assumed for the planet. The regions between the pairs of curves for a given e s therefore represent the temperate (habitable) zone produced by the combination of stellar insolation and tidal heating -which clearly extends this zone to greater distances (by as much as a factor ∼ 2 in planet-star radius for an Earth mass moon with e s = 0.01) from the parent star than the classical, stellar insolation, zone alone.</p><p>However, in addition to the major caveat that the "energy balance" represented by Equation 5 is extremely approximate, it should be noted that the actual levels of tidal heating required in these zones can be as high as ∼ 10 6 erg s −1 cm −2 -which is a factor ∼ 10 3 larger than the surface heat flow estimated for Io. It is an interesting question whether or not this would create such an unstable surface environment that habitability would be compromised. More modest heating levels are required to boost temperatures which are already close to temperate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Tidal boosting and known exoplanet systems</head><p>The outer stable orbit (Equation 1) provides a natural scaling for a moon system architecture. A given hypothetical moon must have a semi-major axis of βa outer s </p><p>Thus, for a given exoplanet in the sample used here we can estimate the time-averaged H T required to attain a given T eq (Equation 5), and for an assumed set of moon properties, such as mass, orbital eccentricity, density, rigidity, dissipation, and atmosphere we can then evaluate the required orbital radius of the moon βa outer s .</p><p>We have applied this calculation to the subset of known exoplanets considered above. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> summarizes the results for the example of a 0.1 M ⊕ moon (the minimum mass moon likely capable of retaining a terrestrial-type atmosphere) with an orbital eccentricity of e s = 0.01, density ρ s = 3 g cm <ref type="bibr">−3</ref> , and albedo, rigidity and dissipation commensurate with that estimated for Europa. We have assumed an atmosphere with ǫ = 0.62. To attain a moon surface temperature T eq = 273K then (as described above) 46 of the exoplanets would require a moon to have H T &gt; 0 to boost the stellar insolation, for T eq = 373K then 70 of the exoplanets would require a moon to have H T &gt; 0. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we plot the distribution of both the absolute orbital semi-major axis required for such moons and the ratio of this orbital axis to the inner (a inner s ) stable orbital semi-major axis. The latter plot confirms that such moons would reside comfortably outside of the inner Roche limit.</p><p>For the range of habitable surface temperatures the required orbital range is ∼ 0.002 − 0.007 AU, corresponding to ∼ 4 − 10 times the innermost stable orbital radius. Since βa outer s only scales as M 2/9 s a larger moon of mass 1M ⊕ would shift these ranges outwards by approximately 67%. In either case, the relevant orbital terrain is very similar in absolute terms, to that occupied by the Galilean moons (as explicitly indicated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>, and does not therefore raise any immediate concerns that this would be an unusual configuration for a giant planet.</p><p>The tidal surface heat flow H T required in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> ranges from ∼ 10 3 − 10 5 erg s −1 cm −2 , compared to (for example) the 1.5 × 10 3 erg s −1 cm −2 estimated for Io. In <ref type="figure">Figure  8</ref> the distribution of total energy dissipation rates for the case of 0.1M ⊕ , e s = 0.01 and T eq = 273K is shown, and ranges from ∼ 10 21 − 10 23 erg s −1 . By comparison, for Io the total dissipation rate is ∼ 6 × 10 20 erg s −1 . These levels of energy dissipation for the boosted moons therefore raise a number of questions. First, very basic order of magnitude energy estimates suggest that dissipation at a level of 10 23 erg s −1 may not provide enough longevity to be of interest for habitability. The total energy of a planet-moon system consisting of a Jupiter mass planet and a 0.1M ⊕ moon with 0.003 AU orbital semi-major axis is dominated by the rotational energy of the giant planet. In the case of Jupiter this total energy is at least 10 4 0 ergs, modulo uncertainties in internal rotation and composition. This energy could be dissipated completely in ∼ 3 billion years at a rate of 10 23 erg s −1 -assuming tidal heating was sustained at this level, whereas in reality the moon might well move out of the assumed mean-motion resonance on a shorter timescale. It is also not yet known whether Jupiter's apparently fast rotation rate is actually typical for giant planets -others may spin slower. For the lower end of dissipation energies the maximum lifetime could be one or two orders of magnitude larger, however the issue remains that the mean-motion resonances may not last that long, and indeed may come and go over a moons lifetime. Second, as discussed in the previous section, it is unclear exactly how these levels of tidal heating would manifest themselves in terms of surface environment. For a liquid ocean dominated moon, the bulk motions would be considerable. For a moon where tidal heating results in significant tectonic and volcanic activity, the surface environment might be rendered less hospitable as a result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Satellite formation and orbital terrain</head><p>We discuss briefly the relationship of surviving moon or satellite systems to the formation and early history of a given planetary system in general. There is currently no clear consensus on the precise formation mechanisms for satellites of giant planets -although it is certainly very different from the mechanism likely responsible for producing the Earth-Moon system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Peale 1999</ref>). The standard model (e.g. see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pollack et al. (1991)</ref>) for the Galilean satellites follows an analog to the core-accretion model for giant planets, but invokes a minimum mass subnebula -where the total observed mass in circumplanetary solid material is added to sufficient gas to match solar element abundances. However, dynamical timescales in satellite systems are much shorter than their planetary analogs and it is not clear that such a model can succeed in reproducing the known Galilean satellites and their often icy compositions. Alternatives include the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Canup &amp; Ward (2002)</ref> which invokes a gas-starved circumplanetary accretion disk where satellites form late relative to the growth of the giant planet (specifically Jupiter). In both scenarios the migration of satellites within the circumplanetary disk can proceed much as it does for the planets themselves.</p><p>Based on the above results, while we have shown that the orbital terrain suitable for significant tidal heating due to planet-moon interaction in the existing exoplanet sample is physically comparable to that in the Jovian system, the actual total stable satellite orbital terrain is typically much smaller by a factor ∼ 5 − 6. This raises the question; does this reduced terrain also reduce the number of potential satellites/moons and therefore reduce the net likelihood of tidally heated moons ?</p><p>As already noted <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>, the actual occupancy of the stable satellite orbital terrain in the Jovian system is small for the Galilean satellites, which span only the inner ∼ 10% of the total allowed range. The lesser satellites, which are a factor 10-100 smaller in radius, do however occupy the terrain out to a outer s . However, the bigger issue is whether an analogous system of large moons could form around a planet with, for example, a total stable orbital terrain some ∼ 16 − 20% of the Jovian range. In order to answer this question we need to know (amongst other factors) whether or not a planet has undergone significant migration toward the parent star, thereby reducing the stable satellite terrain, and how the timing of such a migration compares to the formation time of a satellite system. Two basic, and undoubtedly simplistic, scenarios can be considered which more or less bracket the range of possible models. In the first, the satellite system of a giant planet forms essentially contemporaneously with the planet, and in the case of a migrating planet, during the period of either Type I or II migration. In the second, the satellite system forms "late" in a largely gas-free environment due to N-body accretion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Canup &amp; Ward (2000)</ref>), and at a time when the host planet has ceased migration. In the first scenario, although the planet-star Hill sphere radius shrinks as the planet migrates inwards the circumplanetary disk continues to receive inflowing material (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lubow et al. (1999)</ref>) -thus forming satellites can continue to accrete material even if the stable orbital terrain is shrinking. In the second scenario the formation of satellites is potentially constrained by the amount of material retained according to the Hill sphere criterion (e.g. Equation 1). If the first scenario occurs then we can argue that a reduced final stable orbital terrain compared to, for example, the Jovian system, does not necessarily reduce the likelihood of the formation of an equivalent number of large moons. In this case then it will be correct to state that there is at least an equal potential for tidally heated moon systems in the current exoplanet sample compared to the Jovian system -as summarized by <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. This is also clearly dependent on the actual sub-nebula mass, which we have assumed scales with the final host planet mass. However, in the second scenario it may well be the case that fewer moons can be formed in which case certain exoplanets may represent a more barren terrain for significant moons, heated or otherwise. It should be noted that a third scenario exists, which is that moons are captured bodies which did not participate in the evolution of the sub-nebula.</p><p>The issue of moon composition, in particular the presence of an icy mantle, has been briefly described in §5.0.1. In addition to issues of sublimation rates, a full treatment would necessarily include discussion of the chemical/elemental structure of the proto-planetary nebula, and sub-nebula. The distribution of water in proto-planetary systems is clearly relevant in this case.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary and Discussion</head><p>We present an initial investigation of the potential for, and possible scenarios of, moons around giant exoplanets which are subject to tidal heating and which may therefore provide a distinct class of habitable environment beyond that of the classical "habitable zone". For the majority of a p &gt; 0.6 AU planetary systems discovered thus far, we make a clear prediction that any associated, long-lived, satellite systems will occupy a significantly narrower range of orbital semi-major axes than the examples of the Jovian or Saturnian systems. Despite this, the potential for tidal heating to levels sufficient to sustain sub-surface liquid water oceans does not appear to be impacted, even for Earth-sized moons -if the formation pathways to large moons are not effected by the narrower stable orbital terrain.</p><p>We have also explored the zonal and time-averaged stellar insolation that hypothetical moon systems around known exoplanets might experience. In many cases it seems likely that if ice shrouded moons had at some time existed around these planets then sublimation processes will have likely removed this material. For small moons the volatiles will have been lost, for moons more massive than some 0.1 M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Williams et al. 1997</ref>) an atmosphere may have been retained. Between 28 and 51% of the exoplanet systems studied here are expected to be capable of harboring small moons with intact icy mantles. This translates to between 15 and 27% of the total population of known exoplanets at this time.</p><p>We consider the possibility of a combination of stellar insolation and tidal "boosting" raising the surface temperature of a moon into the temperate range (273 &lt; T eq &lt; 373 K). A very general set of constraints is presented; demonstrating how this can lead to an extended temperate, or habitable, zone of as much as a factor ∼ 2 greater distance from the parent star for massive (∼ 1M ⊕ ) moons. We also find that the relevant orbital terrain around the known exoplanets for tidally boosted, temperate, massive moons is essentially the same as that of the Galilean satellites in the Jovian system. However, the required tidal heating energy budgets range from the level seen in Io to as much as 100 times greater. At this upper extreme it is not clear whether such dissipation could be either long-lived (more than a few 100 million years) or compatible with a habitable surface environment.</p><p>We have ignored a multitude of possible additional factors in making our estimatesfor example, there are likely significant resonance conditions which may occur for moons orbiting planets which are themselves in eccentric orbits about the parent star, and there are also likely influences from other, as yet undetected, planets in the system. We have also not considered resonances beyond simple orbital mean-motions -for example, spinorbit librational resonances such as that likely in the case of <ref type="bibr">Enceladus (Wisdom 2004</ref>). Such effects are interesting and should be explored further. We have also not included any estimate of the likelihood that moons will enter into resonance conditions that will drive orbital eccentricity and hence moon-planet tidal dissipation -or of the dynamical timescales of such situations. This will require a more extensive study which should include modeling of the origin of a satellite or moon system and the potential orbital migration of major satellites within such a system. Such a study should also include an evaluation of any variation in the composition and structural properties of the satellites resulting from different circumstellar/circumplanetary formation distances.</p><p>However, taken at face value, one of the implications of the above observations is that the potential for sub-surface oceans in icy moons, or even ocean moons (for those systems which lie close enough to the parent star for significant surface temperatures to develop, boosted by tidal dissipation) suggests that broad questions of habitability may need to be re-visited to include such environments as significant potential biospheres. As the parameter space for exoplanet detection expands to include lower-mass, larger-orbital-radii systems, and if future missions and instruments begin to detect the presence of moons around giant planets, we will be able to extend the evaluation of such potential habitats.</p><p>The author acknowledges the funding support of the Columbia Astrobiology Center through Columbia University's Initiatives in Science and Engineering, and the support of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory.
