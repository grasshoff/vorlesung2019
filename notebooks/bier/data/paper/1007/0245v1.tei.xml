				<p>Radial velocity (RV) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value of M T sin(i) condition (i.e., give information about) not only the planet&apos;s true mass M T but also the value of sin(i) for that system (where i is the orbital inclination angle). Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed value of M T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a distribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e., the presumptive prior distribution. Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn depends on the intrinsic distribution of M T for the exoplanet population being studied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several &quot;toy models&quot; for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M T. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for simple power-law distributions of M T , the median value of sin(i) in an observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the 0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the range between −2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of indicies, the 95% confidence interval on M T varies from 1.002-4.566 (α = −2) to 1.13-94.34 (α = +1) times larger than M T sin(i) due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M T yield more complicated and somewhat unintuitive posterior sin(i) distributions. In particular, if the M T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M c , the posterior sin(i) distribution will depend on the ratio of M T sin(i) to M c , often in a non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets, both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i) factor as more than a &quot;numerical constant of order unity&quot; with simple and well understood statistical properties. We argue that reports of M T sin(i) determinations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding confidence bounds on M T at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly stated assumed form of the true M T distribution in order to more accurately reflect the mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>As is well known the observational study of exoplanets began with, and in large part has been based on, radial velocity (RV) data which allow a measurement of the planet's orbital parameters plus a value of M T sin(i), where M T is its true mass and sin(i) is the angle between the direction normal to the planet's orbital plane and the observer's sight line (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Marcy et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marcy et al. ( , 2005</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Johnson (2009)</ref>). Indeed, the very classification of an unseen stellar companion as an exoplanet is normally made based on the value of M T sin(i), hereinafter designated as M 0 , the observed or indicative mass.</p><p>It would, of course, be preferable to determine M T itself and avoid the degeneracy with the largely uninteresting random variable sin(i), and our understanding of exoplanet systems has been greatly advanced by the relatively few cases in which the observations of tran- sit events allows the two parameters to be measured separately (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charbonneau et al. (2007)</ref> and references therein and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Winn (2010)</ref> and references there in).</p><p>Nevertheless, the M T sin(i) degeneracy does not seem too serious because it appears to be so simple and well understood. In particular, it seems extremely safe to assume that i is randomly and isotropically distributed or, in other words, that the orientation of the orbital plane of an exoplanet in space is independent of the direction from which we observe it. However, this isotropic distribution only describes the prior distribution of i, not its posterior one, i.e., not the relevant distribution after it is conditioned by the measurement of an M T sin(i) value.</p><p>In order to specify this isotropic i prior distribution of sin(i), consider a longitudinal strip of a sphere between θ = i and θ = i + dθ in polar coordinates. The strip extends around 2π in φ (the azimuthal angle), and the surface area of the strip is just 2πr 2 sin(i)dθ. The probability of a randomly oriented vector piercing through that area is then just its fractional area of the whole surface of the sphere</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f i = 2πr 2 sin(i)dθ/2πr 2<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The pdf of the inclination angle (assuming random orientation) is thus sin(i). In other words, the probability distribution function of the inclination angle of exoplanet falls into this range i to i + dθ is just sin(i).</p><p>In order to determine the prior probability of sin(i), simply consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f i di = f j dj<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where j = sin(i). After some algebraic manipulation, it is easy to show that f j (the pdf of sin(i) falling into a range of sin(i) − d sin(i) and sin(i) + d sin(i)) is sin(i)/ 1 − sin 2 (i). Up to this point, the analysis is straightforward. However, complications arise at the next step, the derivation of the posterior distribution of sin(i), because it depends on the prior or true distribution of M T . As we do not yet know the M T distribution (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marcy et al. (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jorissen et al. (2001)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Udry &amp; Santos (2007)</ref>), this consideration is not only an important one in principle but might also be in practice. The present paper is primarily intended to investigate this issue, the posterior distribution of sin(i) given an observation of M 0 , in some detail.</p><p>Before presenting a Bayesian analysis in the next sections, it may be helpful to note that the issue resembles familiar complications in interpreting photometric data that are conventionally called Malmquist-type biases (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Malmquist (1920)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eddington (1913)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hogg &amp; Turner (1998)</ref>) in some respects. Namely, even if the measurement errors are symmetric and unbiased (and, in the simple cases most often analyzed, also gaussianly distributed...but that is not essential), the true brightness of an astronomical object is normally more likely to be fainter than its measured brightness than it is to be brighter. The well known reason is that there are usually a larger number of fainter objects than brighter ones on which the (symmetrical) measurement errors may act to produce the observed brightness.</p><p>However, the considerations for sin(i) which we investigate in this paper are not related to measurement errors. It would be unchanged even if all of the observations in question were perfect and ideal. Neither is it a selection bias on sin(i) of the sort that was briefly considered as an explanation of exoplanet RV discoveries in their earliest days (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Black (1997)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gray (1997)</ref>). Rather, we are considering the unavoidable consequences of the combination of a physical variable, M T with an unobservable stochastic one, sin(i), when conditioned by a measurement of their product. This is, of course, a classical issue in Bayesian statistics.</p><p>Section 2 defines the basic question addressed by this paper and gives a very simple illustrative example of why it can be an important issue. Section 3 presents a Bayesian derivation of the equations needed to answer the question for any given distribution of masses for a population of exoplanets, and Section 4 presents the results of the analysis obtained by assuming various "toy models" for the true exoplanet distribution of masses. We then discuss observational selection effects briefly in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6 with a discussion of its practical implications for RV studies of exoplanets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE</head><p>The question we wish to analyze can be formulated in two equivalent but slightly different forms, one describing the M T distribution and one the sin(i) distribution:</p><p>1) What is the probability that M T is less than X, given that RV data yield</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M 0 (= M T sin(i))?</formula><p>The answer may be written as P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) and depends on P (M T ), the intrinsic distribution of exoplanet masses.</p><p>2) What is the probability that sin(i) is less than Z, given that RV data yield M 0 (= M T sin(i))? This answer may be written as P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 ) and also depends on P (M T ).</p><p>To relate the sin(i) probability distribution and the true mass distribution, it is simply:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) = 1 − P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>for Z = X MT . To illustrate the fundamental issue, consider the following toy model: Suppose that all exoplanets have a true mass of either 1.0 M J or 2.0 M J where M J is the mass of Jupiter and that there are an equal number of exoplanets with each of these masses. If an exoplanet is determined to have M 0 = M T sin(i) = 0.5 M J , the value of sin(i) is obviously either 0.5 or 0.25 depending on whether it is one of the low or high true mass exoplanets, respectively. Moreover, since a sin(i) value of 0.5 is about 2.236 times more likely than one of 0.25 for the prior (isotropic i) distribution of sin(i), it follows that the posterior distribution of sin(i) for this system consists of two δ functions, one at 0.5 and one at 0.25 with the former having an amplitude 2.236 times that of the latter.</p><p>Since any intrinsic exoplanet mass distribution could be arbitrarily well approximated by a series of δ functions, we can conclude that the the intrinsic mass distribution affects the posterior distribution of the sin(i), for any particular observed value of M 0 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISTRIBUTIONS</head><p>Consider a planet at any mass M T .

This distribution function is plotted in the upper panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> in cumulative form, we can also look at the probability of observed mass M 0 given M T , which is simply the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P (M 0 |M T ) = M0 MT 1 − ( M0 MT ) 2<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Thus, the culmulative prior probability of observed mass M 0 given M T (note that we are here fixing true mass M T and calculating the prior distribution of the observed mass M 0 , while in the analyses which follows we will do just the reverse to obtain posterior distributions) and setting M T = 1 is just:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P (M 0 &lt; X|M T = 1) = 1 − 1 − X 2<label>(9)</label></formula><p>As expected, the plot has the same behavior as in P (sin(i) &lt; Z), as plotted in the lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. Proceeding now to posterior distributions, Bayes' Theorem states</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P (A|B) = P (B|A)P (A) P (B)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Assigning A = M T and B = M 0 , we directly obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P (M T |M 0 ) = P (M 0 |M T )P (M T ) P (M 0 )<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Equation 8 gives the first term in the numerator of Eq. 11. The second term in the numerator is an unknown function (which ultimately may be determined from observations), but it is possible to consider simple toy models, plausible guesses and even theoretical estimates for P (M T ) and thus explore their consequences. Finally, the denominator of Eq. 11 can be obtained from</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P (M 0 ) = P (M 0 |M T )P (M T )dM T<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P (M T |M 0 ) = P (M 0 |M T )P (M T ) P (M 0 |M T )P (M T )dM T<label>(13)</label></formula><p>which provides the desired posterior distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P (M T |M 0 ) = M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 P (M T ) M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 P (M T )dM T (14) for M 0 &lt; M T .</formula><p>It is frequently most interesting to consider instead the cumulative probability distribution at which M T &lt; X, requiring the integration of the numerator of Eq. 13 up to X. This gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) = X P (M T |M 0 )P (M T )dM T P (M T |M 0 )P (M T )dM T<label>(15)</label></formula><p>Since if the observed mass is M 0 , then the true mass M T has to be larger than or equal to M 0 , since M 0 = M T sin(i) and sin(i) ≤ 1, therefore the lower integral limit is M 0 , and the upper mass limit could be as large as physically possible for mass of a planet (M max ). Therefore, we have the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) = X M0 M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 P (M T )dM T Mmax M0 M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 P (M T )dM T (16)</formula><p>The upper bound on the integral in the denominator M max is somewhat arbitrary, corresponding to the maximum mass of any planet drawn from the P (M T ) distribution. However, the value of M max affects only the normalization of P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ), not its form.</p><p>This formulation in terms of M T most transparently displays the underlying logic of the derivation. However, the same approach can equally well give the answer to question #2 above, since the two are equivalent. In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 ) = P (M T &gt; X|M 0 )<label>(17)</label></formula><p>And, thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 ) = 1 − M0/Z M0 M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 f MT (y)dy Mmax M0 M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2</formula><p>f MT (y)dy (18) Due to our current ignorance of the true P (M T ), we cannot evaluate these expressions uniquely for the actual observed values of M 0 of known exoplanets. It is nevertheless instructive to do so for various assumed P (M T ) distributions. We devote the remainder of the paper primarily to that exercise.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MASS DISTRIBUTIONS</head><p>In order to investigate the size and character of the statistical effect under discussion, we will apply the formula derived in the previous section to a series of simple "toy models" of P (M T ), some of which might turn out to reassemble reality at least qualitatively. From the previous derivation, P (M T ) is assumed to be a normalized probability, however, in the following discussion, we will be adopting f MT (y) as the absolute true mass distribution (with no normalization). This is simply due to the fact that both of the derived Bayesian equations (Eq. 16 and Eq. 18) are normalizable quantities, so using the absolute true mass distribution f MT (y) is not a problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Power Law M T Distributions</head><p>Beginning with a particularly simple possibility, we now assume the distribution of true masses of exoplanets follow a power-law, thus we adopt the form f MT (y) = Ay α , where both A and α are constants. Then we can evaluate the the main integral (hereafter</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Φ(M 0 , α) = M 0 M T 1−( M 0 M T ) 2 AM α T dM T )</formula><p>of Eq. 16 for several cases (α = 1, α = 0, α = −1, α = −2) to obtain the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Φ(M 0 , α) =                  AM T 1 − M 2 0 M 2 T if α = 1, A √ M 2 T −1 log(2 √ M 2 T −1+MT ) MT 1− 1 M 2 T if α = 0, −A tan −1 ( 1 √ M 2 T −1 ) if α = −1, A M0 1 − M 2 0 M 2 T if α = −2.<label>(19)</label></formula><p>For the distribution of sin(i), we can refer to Eq.3. We use this result to plot a few specific cases in <ref type="figure">Fig 2,</ref> assuming various values of α.</p><p>Note from <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> that α = −2 gives a median sin(i) value of 0.860 while an equally plausible value of α = −1 gives a median sin(i) value of 0.704. If the mass distribution is an increasing function of mass, the resulting median sin(i) value will be reduced quite dramatically; for example α = 1 gives a median sin(i) value of 0.02! It is equally easy to generate the corresponding P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) distributions, using Eq. 16, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig 3.</ref> Since the observed mass is set to 1, thus, the true mass has to be larger than 1, and as the power-law  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-The posterior probability function P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 ) assuming a power-law mass function. When we have a large α, there are many large planets, thus, we are more likely to have a small sin(i) in order to match the observed M 0 . When we have a small α or a negative α, there are many small planets, so we have a higher probability of a larger sin(i) to match the observed M 0 .  index increases, (which means a larger number of high mass planets in the true mass distribution), the probability of finding a planet below X decreases (as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig 3)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Z α = -1, M 0 =1 α = -2, M 0 =1 α=0, M 0 =1 α = 1, M 0 =1, M max = 100</formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">P(M T &lt;X | M 0 =1) X α = -1, M 0 =1 α = -2, M 0 =1 α=0, M 0 =1 α = 1, M 0 =1, M max = 20</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Power Law Plus a Delta Function M T Distributions</head><p>The distribution of planetary masses in the Solar System, the highly non-linear and at least partially nongravitational nature of planet formation as well as some specific theoretical models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kokubo &amp; Ida (1996)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kokubo et al. (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ida &amp; Lin (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baraffe et al. (2010)</ref> and references therein) suggest that the P (M T ) distribution might contain one or more characteristic masses, rather than being an entirely scale free power law. In order to investigate the implications of such a P (M T ), we consider a toy model in which some of the exoplanets are distributed in an α = −2 power law population while the others all have the same mass M c . We may then again evaluate the expressions of Section II directly.</p><p>Thus we have f MT (y) = Ay α + Bδ(y − M c ), where M c is the critical mass scale of interest. It is convenient to introduce the dimensionless parameter η, defined by M 0 = ηM c and to set A and B equal. Without loss of generality M c = 1 is adopted (i.e., M c is defined as the unit of mass) for purposes of plotting and giving numerical values. We can then obtain the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) = 1 η 1 − η 2 X 2 + η √ 1−η 2 1 η 1 − η 2 M 2 max + η √ 1−η 2 (20)</formula><p>given that M 0 &lt; M c &lt; X &lt; M max .

Finally, if M 0 &lt; X &lt; M max &lt; M c , then the results are similar to the original situation when f MT (y) = Ay α except that some of the planets are in the δ function part of the distribution, thus reducing the relative probability of sampling the power-law portion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">P (M T &lt; X|M 0 ) = 1 2 1 η 1 − η 2 X 2 1 η 1 − η 2 M 2 max (22)</formula><p>We can also obtain the distribution of sin(i):</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">P (sin(i) &lt; Z|M 0 ) = 1 − 1 2 1 η √ 1 − Z 2 1 η 1 − η 2 M 2 max (23) if 0 &lt; sin(i) &lt; M 0 /M c &lt; M 0 /X.</formula><p>If we set Z = M0 X and M 0 = ηM c , while M c = 1, then we can plot the following <ref type="figure">figure Fig 4.</ref> It illustrates the discontinuity in the probability at the delta function (i.e., when η = Z).</p></div>

This distribution can be modeled very roughly as two power-laws separated by a gap in mass. One power-law lies at a low mass range (the terrestrial planets) while the other lies at a much higher mass range (the giant planets).

One can see that there is a significant jump in probability of P (sin(i) &lt; Z|η) whenever M 0 = Mc (aka η = Z).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">OBSERVATIONAL SELECTION EFFECTS</head><p>In the preceding analysis we have consistently assumed that exoplanets discovered by the RV method uniformly (i.e., without bias) sample the distribution of M T and sin(i) values in nature. Obviously, this is unrealistic. In reality, both variables (and others) influence the probability that a given exoplanet system will be detected in an RV survey, and this selection bias in turn affects the likely values of both M T and sin(i). Fig. 5.-Both of the above panels show the posterior probability distribution of sin(i) and M for a Solar System like mass distribution. The upper panel shows the probability P (sin(i) &lt; Z|η) as we change η, thus the observed mass M 0 goes from 0.1Mc to 10, 000Mc. The lower panel plots P (M &lt; X|M 0 = ηMc) as we change X. Mc is set to 1 as usual.</p><p>Happily, this complication does not fundamentally alter our results because the basic effect discussed in this paper is a purely statistical one, independent of any observational biases. More specifically, one could conduct an exactly parallel analysis in which the true distributions of M T and sin(i), which appear in equations Eq. 16 to Eq. 18, are replaced with the biased distributions which a particular RV survey samples, if its selection function can be determined reasonably accurately.</p><p>A very simple example would be a case in which the probability of an RV survey detecting an exoplanet of mass M T is given by some selection function S(M T ), independent of sin(i) and other properties of the system. In that case, it suffices to replace P (M T ) with S(M T )P (M T ) everywhere it occurs in the equations and proceed as before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">IMPLICATIONS</head><p>The primary implication of the results presented here is that in general the value of sin(i) for a given exoplanet system will not be drawn from its prior distribution, corresponding to an isotropic distribution of i as is often assumed, at least implicitly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-The upper panel shows the cumulative prior distribution of sin(i).
