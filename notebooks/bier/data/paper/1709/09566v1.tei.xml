			<abstract>
				<p>NASA regards data handling and archiving as an integral part of space missions, and has a strong track record of serving astrophysics data to the public, beginning with the the IRAS satellite in 1983. Archives enable a major science return on the significant investment required to develop a space mission. In fact, the presence and accessibility of an archive can more than double the number of papers resulting from the data. In order for the community to be able to use the data, they have to be able to find the data (ease of access) and interpret the data (ease of use). Funding of archival research (e.g., the ADAP program) is also important not only for making scientific progress, but also for encouraging authors to deliver data products back to the archives to be used in future studies. NASA has also enabled a robust system that can be maintained over the long term, through technical innovation and careful attention to resource allocation. This article provides a brief overview of some of NASA&apos;s major astrophysics archive systems, including IRSA, MAST, HEASARC, KOA, NED, the Exoplanet Archive, and ADS.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since at least 1983, NASA has regarded data handling and archiving as an integral part of astrophysics space missions. This commitment now provides the major return on the considerable investment the agency has made over the past 20 years (Committee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics 2010).</p><p>All astronomy archives provide sustainability. The Committee on NASA Astronomy Science <ref type="bibr">Centers (2007)</ref> concluded that a sustainable archive provides data discovery and analysis tools; facilitates new science; contains high-quality, reliable data; provides simple and useful tools to a broad community; provides user support to the novice as well as to the power user; and adapts and evolves in response to community input.</p><p>NASA believes that an astronomy archive's job includes the following major tasks.</p><p>• Ingest new data, including reprocessing of old data.</p><p>• Maintain and continue to serve a vital repository of irreplaceable data, in which considerable investment has already been made. This includes support for observation planning as well as, particularly in NASA's case, mission planning. The archive must also be a resource for original science, and a place to find high level science products.</p><p>• Enable cutting-edge research. NASA does this by supporting application programming interfaces (API) and supporting the Virtual Observatory (VO) protocols; by providing expert user support; by developing new and enhanced services; and by enabling multi-wavelength projects.</p><p>The last of these is evolving quickly as the amount of data steadily increases. The archive's mission is changing from "search-and-retrieve" for a user to analyze locally (on their own machine), to doing at least some analysis in situ, in the archive, prior to downloading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Archives Enable Science</head><p>If one has never thought about the utilty of an archive, one might ask whether anyone other than the proposing astronomer might be interested in a particular data set. However, the reality is that science archives extend the useful life of NASA's mission data indefinitely, as new results can continue to be gleaned from the data in context with new observations and fresh analyses. For example, we are still learning things from IRAS data more than 33 years after the mission ended (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Rebull et al. (2015)</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> demonstrates some specific examples of how archives double an observatory's output. The first plot shows the fraction of refereed astrophysics journal articles, worldwide, as a function of time. As of 2014, 10% of all refereed journal articles use data that ultimately come from IRSA (this includes 2MASS, WISE, and Spitzer). The upper right plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows the fraction of Spitzer papers as a function of time. Early in the Spitzer mission, all papers were written by program PIs; this makes sense, since the people most equipped to process data and write papers initially are those associated with the instrument teams and/or the mission itself. However, by 2008, more papers came from archival research than programs tied to specific principal investivators (PIs). This effect is not just limited to infrared missions; the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> shows Hubble papers as a function of time. Once again, after the first several years of the mission, archival research dominates, contributing more than half the papers.</p><p>Here are just a few archival science highlights:</p><p>• WISE and Spitzer discover the coldest brown dwarf (Luhman 2014)</p><p>• WISE morphological study of Wolf-Rayet nebulae ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Toalá et al. 2015)</ref> • Buckyballs in a young planetary nebula using Spitzer data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Cami et al. 2010)</ref> • WISE, 2MASS, and PanSTARRS data may reveal super-void in cosmic microwave background (CMB) cold spot seen by Planck ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Szapudi et al. 2015</ref>) • The planets HR8799 b,c,d were imaged by HST in 1998; post-processing speckle subtraction now available provides more than an order of magnitude contrast improvement over what the state of the art had been when data were taken in 1998 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Soummer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Pueyo et al. 2015)</ref> • </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">IPAC/NExScI: NASA Exoplanet Archive</head><p>The NASA Exoplanet Archive is also located at IPAC at Caltech 3 . It is focused on exoplanets and the stars they orbit, and stars thought to harbor exoplanets. It includes Kepler data, and is the U.S. portal to CoRoT data. It also has online tools to work with these data, like the periodogram service. It also has a place (Exo-FOP) for observers to upload/share data on planets and planet candidates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">IPAC/NExScI: KOA</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">More archives</head><p>Other archives based at these centers, not all necessarily NASA-funded, also follow this model. Two examples at STScI are Pan-STARRS (optical ground-based synoptic data) and VLA-FIRST (radio data). The Palomar Oschin wide-field survey is one example at IRSA; it has three incarnations, Zwicky Transient Facility (2017+), intermediate <ref type="bibr">Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF;</ref><ref type="bibr">2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">-2016</ref>, and the Palomar Transient Factory <ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>. There are, of course, many other non-NASA archives in the U.S. (SDSS, NRAO, etc.) and around the world (CDS, ESO, ESA, etc.). These are beyond the scope of this article, and information about them can be found in other articles in this and prior ADASS conference proceedings.</p><p>Also, in many cases, observers can deliver data back to these centers for distribution, which may include data beyond original program; more on this below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Lessons Learned</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Easy Access and Support</head><p>All of these archives have easy access. Researchers at all levels (including team members, emeriti professors, and summer students) all need to be able to get and use data easily. Thus, these archives need an intuitive, web-based interface, with no extra software installation required. Users want to be able to visualize and assess the data, using tools at the archive, but they also want to simply download the data to their own disk as fast as possible.</p><p>Expert help needs to be there when users need it, meaning that documentation has to be easily found and/or helpdesk tickets promptly answered. The archive must provide access to knowledgeable staff, who have done science with the data products, who can (a) find problems, and (b) pass on valuable experience to new users. Speed and accuracy matters for the Helpdesk; people do not want to be 'left hanging.' Some questions can be very complex; acknowledging that a person has read the ticket and is working on it is important, even if it takes days/weeks to actually get an answer. Documentation can come with tools and/or data releases, or in response to specific tickets (special/unusual or frequently asked questions). Documentation should be updated frequently in response to tickets. Demonstrations of holdings and new tools can be provided live (at meetings like the AAS, ADASS, DPS, etc.), or in video tutorials (IRSA has &gt;60 videos; &gt;4500 views total). The complexity of science user needs increases with time, because the 'easy stuff' has already been done -more advanced data reduction techniques become available, or users need to query the database in a way not envisioned when the archive was designed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Data Visualization and Discovery</head><p>Visualization at the archive is important. Science users coming to look for original data, catalogs, or plots need to be able to find what they are looking for. Users probably mostly come specifically to find a particular data set, but they may also come looking for generally anything available on their target. They come knowing that they need a particular item, but if data discovery is easy, they will find more data products of use to them. Visualization helps them assess if the data are of interest or not, before downloading (and reading the documentation!).</p><p>High level science products make data discovery easy and greatly enhance the science return of the archives by making complex data sets accessible to a wider audience of researchers. For people who are, for example, not experts at reducing Spitzer data, being able to find already-reduced multi-wavelength reliable photometry of their target means that the barriers to being a Spitzer data user are lower, and Spitzer data get used in more projects. Hubble Legacy high-level science products (HLSP) are used 10 times as much as more typical HST pipeline products. Especially when there are large, coherent projects (such as Hubble Treasury, Spitzer Legacy, or Spitzer Exploration Science), data reduction can be optimized for the science, and data products become even more usable. For example, source extraction over the entire sky has to take into account bright and faint backgrounds, with a variety of source densities, and often depth is sacrificed for accuracy. With a focused project, source extraction can be optimized for that project, say, the Galactic Plane, and both depth and accuracy is higher than with a broader project. These high level science products products can be generated by the support center for the telescope, or contributed by the community back to the archive.</p><p>More recently, some delivered high level science products have included source lists from entire missions (Spitzer, Hubble, Chandra, Herschel, WISE, etc.). In those situations, easily combining data across wavelengths widens the user base for each data set and deepens the science return.</p><p>One example of such cross-wavelength advances comes from NED. In context of assessing the completeness of the database, while studying the fusion of extragalactic data from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, and more, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ogle et al. (2016)</ref> found super-luminous spiral galaxies. This result was found by looking at what was already in the archive.</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ogle et al. (2016)</ref> result is just one example of two important concepts. (1) As the data sets get bigger and bigger, scientists won't be able to pull all of the data out of the archive to work with it. IRAS catalogs, considered enormous at the time, can fit on a modern iPhone without anyone particularly noticing, but WISE catalogs top 50 billion rows. Requests to 'download the entire catalog' aren't trivial. The mission of the archive is evolving from a 'search-and-retrieve' approach to one of 'do at least some analysis in situ.' (2) In the era of larger and larger data sets ('big data'), there are science discoveries waiting in the archives that were never imagined or expected by the mission or even program PIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Priorities and Long-Term Commitment</head><p>In order to set priorities, the archives rely on community feedback. Each archive has ideas of what they would like to do next, but these plans should be shaped by what the community needs, wants, wishes for, or (in some cases) doesn't know they want yet. This input is collected from mission staff members, user committees, user surveys, helpdesk tickets, giving talks and demonstrations at conferences, and the explicit funding review cycles, and all of that feeds into setting priorities.</p><p>NASA as a whole (and sometimes individual missions) explicitly funds archives, as well as archival research. The NASA ADAP (Astrophysics Data Analysis Program) is specifically set up to fund researchers primarily using archival data. Having a welldesigned archive &amp; products can greatly enhance the research value of the dataset. In order to achieve that goal, archives need to reduce the barriers to usage. They need to make it easy to find the data, and make the data accessible and easy to use (which speaks to reliability, units, file format, instrumental artifacts, and documentation). In this fashion, NASA explicitly enables new ideas of things to do with older data. Moreover, NASA has a strong tradition of active collaboration between missions and archives. In practice, this means that even missions not yet launched are thinking about optimizing the resulting science from their future archives.</p><p>The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) is responsible for standardized VO protocols for interoperability between archives (i.e., NOT the applications that use those protocols). Tools that use VO protocols, however, make data discovery easier. For example, users can, with the interface they know, get access to new data elsewhere. The VO protocols enable interoperability of tools, within archives and across archives.</p><p>There is also infrastructure in place to ensure that information (not just data) flows between the people running these archives. Three organizations that do this are the Astronomy Data Centers Executive Committee (ADEC), the US Virtual Observatory Alliance (USVOA), and the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO). NAVO enables comprehensive and consistent access to all NASA data through VO protocols. It coordinates NASA interactions with the international and national VO communities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows that the rate at which IRSA receives VO-protocol queries is increasing with time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Keeping it Running</head><p>As archives, and the science they enable, grow more sophisticated, there are more and more API queries made of the archives. APIs, or application program interfaces, to the archives enable programs, scripts, or even users at the command line to query the archives. Scripted access to archive data enables complex projects. However, it also enables rapid queries. New users of the API, in particular, can launch inadvertent denial of service attacks on the servers. A real life example (from IRSA) is more than 70,000 requests over 10 hours, or an average of 2 per second. The servers must be watched to ensure that no one user is robbing the rest of the community of bandwidth and computing resources. Empirically, IRSA has many users making small requests via the APIs, but a few users make enormous requests.</p><p>The archive must be kept running 24/7 while improving it, or 'assembling the plane while it is in flight.' The archives aim to increase the audience and their usage of the archive while keeping it within existing resources. As a result, the archives must be efficient in how they use resources. One example of how IRSA does this is to use the same software across multiple data sets (see talk by X. Wu).</p><p>IRSA has an interactive user interface, re-using pieces developed by other projects at IPAC. NED is experimenting with machine learning; NED needs to absorb data that is embedded in free-form text, where the tables are not standard. For example, the position of the object may be given in a column whose header is one of RA, Ra, ra, R.A., or something else entirely. NED has a pilot project to apply machine learning to classify data and facilitate their extraction. The archives must improve scalability, extensibility, and data prospecting, and they must accomplish greater integration of functionality and content across systems. For example, ADS, as an archive focused on the literature, bridges the "data" world of astronomy archives and the "publishing" world of scholarly literature. As such it integrates content and functionality relevant to both. ORCID offers an example of a standard which has been promoted by publishers to help with author disambiguation; integration of the claiming and indexing in ADS means that the astronomy community has an "easy" way to create the claims using a trusted platform. Searching by object name using SIMBAD TAP offers an example of integration of cross-archive functionality in the new ADS using VO standards. ADS also provides embedding of publisher images via APIs.</p><p>The archives have to be ready to ingest new data from the community. At IRSA, Spitzer Legacy programs changed the astronomy culture by mandating that products be delivered back to the community. Now such data deliveries are a common feature of Spitzer proposals. As discussed above, these deliveries bring these data to a larger audience via the central Spitzer archive. But, IRSA has to have resources to ingest these products. The expense is not necessarily in hardware resources but in the time it takes to educate the people delivering the products. The delivery has to be well-organized and documented, not just for the people at IRSA operationally ingesting the data, but for all future users of the data. For people who frequently make deliveries, this is (now) easy. It is not necessarily easy for people new at making deliveries. IRSA has developed tools to help people learn, but it still takes time and often hand-holding. Complexity is not just about size. And an unanticipated side effect is that you can get optical and UV data out of the Spitzer archive (SINGS, LVL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">What's Next: Big Data</head><p>The era of "big data" is here for some missions, and certainly it has arrived when one considers collectively the data across all of the NASA astrophysics archives. IRSA has already invested in data visualization services to help people identify and experiment with data quickly, and decide whether they want to download the data or not. Planning for big data includes identifying the most critical needs of users, including increased analysis at the archive facilitated by user workspaces, and richer services for in-situ analysis. All of the archives are thinking about this in some way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary</head><p>Long-term, sustainable archives greatly increase the return on observatory investment, doubling the science return in published papers. Having robust, reliable support for both expert and novice users pays off. User support by instrument experts is crucial for the sucessful use of the data/archives by the wider astronomy community. Standardization of tools within an archive increases efficiency. Interoperability between archives increases access to data sets and facilitates multi-mission analysis. High level data products can expand the reach of large data sets. The archives are seeing a shift in approach from 'search and retrieve' to 'analyze in situ.'</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
