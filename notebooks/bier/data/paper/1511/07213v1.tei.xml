				<p>Aims. One of the necessary parameters needed for the interpretation of the light curves of transiting exoplanets or eclipsing binary stars, as well as interferometric measurements of a star or microlensing events is how the intensity and polarization of a light change from the center to the limb of a star. Scattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect both the center-to limb variation of intensity (CLVI) and polarization (CLVP). In this paper, we present a study of the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra considering different contributions of scattering and absorption opacity for different spectral type stars with spherical atmospheres. Methods. We solve the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in the presence of continuum scattering, considering spherical model of a stellar atmosphere. We developed two independent codes based on Feautrier and short characteristics methods, respectively, to cross-check our results. Results. We calculate the center-to-limb variation of intensity (CLVI) and polarization (CLVP) in continuum for the Phoenix grid of spherical stellar model atmospheres for a range of effective temperatures (4000 − 7000K), gravities (log g = 1.0 − 5.5) and wavelengths (4000 − 7000Å), which are tabulated and available at the CDS. In addition, we present several tests of our codes and compare our calculations for the solar atmosphere with published photometric and polarimetric measurements. We also show that our two codes provide similar results in all considered cases. Conclusions. For sub-giant and dwarf stars (log g = 3.0−4.5), lower gravity and lower effective temperature of a star lead to higher limb polarization of the star. For giant and supergiant stars (log g = 1.0 − 2.5), the highest effective temperature yields the largest polarization. By decreasing of the effective temperature of a star down to 4500−5500K (depending on log g) the limb polarization decreases and reaches a local minimum. It increases again down to temperatures of 4000K. For the most compact dwarf stars (log g = 5.0−5.5) the limb polarization degree shows a maximum for models with effective temperatures in the range 4200−4600K (depending on log g) and decreases toward higher and lower temperatures.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Center-to-limb variation (i.e., the angular variation) of intensity (CLVI) and polarization (CLVP) are necessary for interpretation of light curves of a star during exoplanetary transits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Müller et al. 2013;</ref>) of eclipsing binary systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bass et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kemp et al. 1983</ref>) as well as for interpreting interferometric observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wittkowski et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chiavassa et al. 2010</ref>) and microlensing observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">An et al. 2002)</ref>, and helioseismology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kuhn et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Toutain et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kuhn et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>Proper interpretation of exoplanet light curves resulting from high-precision photometry (e.g. obtained by Kepler mission) requires precise computations of center-to-limb variations of the intensity (i.e. limb darkening/brightening) for stars of different spectral classes. Limb darkening calculations for extensive grids of plane-parallel 1D hydrostatic stellar model atmospheres were made by different authors (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Claret (2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Sing (2010)</ref>). In our previous works, we studied the CLV of intensity and polarization for plane-parallel stellar atmosphere models of different spectral classes <ref type="bibr">(FGK)</ref> and surface gravities log g = 3.0 − 5.0 . Recently, Harrington (2015) calculated linear polarization in continuum for MARC stellar atmosphere models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gustafsson et al. 2008</ref>) and found it systematically higher than ours for the same effective temperatures and log g. It was suggested that this difference results from contribution of spectral lines. Spectral lines are important for blue wavelengths where there may be little real continuum observed, but for 4000Å and longer the difference in our results can be due to considering different stellar model atmosphere (see, for example, comparison of continuum polarization for several solar models by ). We will investigate line contribution in a separate paper.</p><p>However, for lines of sight near the limb of the star, the approximation of plane-parallel model atmosphere is not valid. The reason for that is that these 'rays' take significantly different path from what is predicted by a plane-parallel assumption. The more extended the stellar atmosphere (lower surface gravity) is, the more pronounced this effect is. Therefore, to obtain precise values of intensity near the limb of the star one needs to calculate CLVI using spherical model atmospheres. There are several theoretical studies where limb darkening coefficients in different photometric bands are computed for stars with spherical model atmospheres (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Claret et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Claret et al. , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr">Neilson &amp; Lester 2013a,b)</ref>.</p><p>Consider, for example, an exoplanetary transit. As the ingress and egress moments are critical for describing the light curves, accurate calculations, especially close to the limb, are necessary for the interpretation of light curves. In some cases it is not sufficient to use polynomial fit in µ to describe stellar limb darkening.</p><p>On the other hand, the center-to-limb variation of linear polarization in the continuum is not so well studied despite the fact that it yields a lot of information about stellar atmospheres. Recently,  showed that variation of linear polarization during a transit provides information on physical parameters of stellar spots (such as size and position), as well as on the orbital parameters of exoplanets (for example, longitude of ascending node that cannot be derived from the photometric light curve). The crucial input in these calculations is the center-to-limb variation of linear polarization.</p><p>In this paper we calculate the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra of different spectral classes under the assumption of spherical geometry. In addition, we expanded the range of effective temperatures and surface gravities as compared to our previous study ( ). As there are no earlier results for CLVP for spherical atmosphere of different stars to compare our calculations with, we developed two independent codes for solving the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in presence of continuum scattering, in order to make a cross-check of our results. In the next section we describe the two methods of solving the radiative transfer equations in detail. Section 3 contains the comparative tests and results of our calculations of solar and stellar CLVI and CLVP. The conclusions of our paper are presented in the fourth section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods of calculation</head><p>Polarized radiation is fully described by four Stokes parameters I ,Q,U and V . It is customary to assume a coordinate system where Stokes parameter Q is either parallel or perpendicular to the local limb (here we choose the former, as in . In this paper we are considering continuum polarization due to scattering by atoms and free electrons (Rayleigh and Thomson scattering, respectively). This means that, as in one-dimensional models there is no way of breaking axial symmetry, Stokes U is equal to zero. The same is valid for the V component, as neither scattering nor magnetic fields can produce circular polarization in the continuum. Note that in case of spectral lines both Stokes U and V can be non-zero, via mechanisms known as Hanle and Zeeman effect, respectively (see, for example, monograph by Landi Degl <ref type="bibr">'Innocenti &amp; Landolfi 2004</ref>).</p><p>Therefore, in the problem we are facing, the Stokes vector can be described as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(r, µ, λ) = I Q ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where µ = cos θ and θ defines a line of sight direction with respect to the atmospheric normal. For the direction corresponding to the center of stellar disk µ = 1, while for the stellar limb µ = 0. r is the radial coordinate (our models are spherically symmetric and hence one-dimensional) and λ is the wavelength of the radiation. To obtain the emergent Stokes vector, one has to solve the polarized radiative transfer equation in the stationary spherically symmetric media (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hubeny &amp; Mihalas 2014)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µ ∂I(r, µ, λ) ∂r + 1 − µ 2 r ∂I(r, µ, λ) ∂µ = − (k c + σ c ) I(r, µ, λ) + η(r, µ, λ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where η is emission term which comes from both the thermal emission (free-free and free-bound processes) and from scattering processes. k c and σ c stand for coefficients of absorption and scattering, respectively. Their sum gives total absorption koefficient. It is common to refer to the ratio of emission and absorption coefficients as the "source function". The source function (S) in the continuum can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(r, µ, λ) = 1 (k c + σ c ) (k c B(λ) + σ c S s (r, µ, λ)),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where B(λ) describes photon creation from the thermal pool of the gas and is described by the Planck function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">B(λ) = B(λ, T ) 0 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>S s (r, µ, λ) defines the contribution from scattering sources, and is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S s (r, µ, λ) = 1 −1 P R (µ, µ ′ ) I λ (r, µ ′ , λ) dµ ′ 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where µ ′ is the direction of the incident radiation, and P R is the Rayleigh phase matrix that takes the angular dependence of Rayleigh and Thomson scattering (e.g., Stenflo 1994):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P R = E 11 + 3 4 P 2 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Matrix E 11 has only one non-zero element, E 11 = 1 that describes unpolarized, isotropic scattering. The matrix P 2 describes the linear polarization scattering and has the following form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P 2 = 1 2 1 3 (1 − 3µ 2 )(1 − 3µ ′2 ) (1 − 3µ 2 )(1 − µ ′2 ) (1 − µ 2 )(1 − 3µ ′2 ) 3(1 − µ 2 )(1 − µ ′2 ) .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>To solve the radiative transfer equation in a spherical coordinate system (Eq. 2), it is advantageous to describe the angular and spatial dependence of the radiation field by a set of parallel rays that are tangential to the discrete radial shells. This is known as the "along-the-ray" approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avrett &amp; Loeser 1984)</ref>. The new coordinate system is described by the impact parameter p that illustrates rays and the distance along z <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.1)</ref>. The radius in the new coordinate system can be written through the p and z as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r = p 2 + z 2 .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Each ray p intersects the radial shells r at an angle θ whose cosine µ is written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">µ = r 2 − p 2 r = z p 2 + z 2 .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Article number, page 2 of 13 N.

Substituting Eq. 5 into Eq. 3 and then in Eq. 12 would lead to an integro-differential equation for the specific intensity and polarization. With given boundary conditions, this integrodifferential equation can be solved directly but it turns out that the iterative solution of the coupled systems of equations 3, 5 and 12 is faster and more robust. Starting from the initial guess for the source function (usually S I = B and S Q = 0) one computes angular and spatial distribution of the intensity and polarization and uses them to compute new value of the source functions. The process is then repeated and iterated until convergence. This approach is known as Λ iteration. For a much wider and more detailed insight in the problem, see, for example, new edition of the classical reference "Stellar Atmospheres", by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hubeny &amp; Mihalas (2014)</ref>. In this work we use the iterative approach to the problem. The main issue then is to numerically solve Eq. 12, given the current values of the source function. This equation is known as the formal solution. We perform the formal solution using two different techniques that are described in the next two subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Feautrier solution of the radiative transfer equation</head><p>The first approach to the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation considered in our paper is the Feautrier method modified for a spherically symmetric coordinate system <ref type="bibr">(Hummer &amp; Rybicki 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mihalas 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sen &amp; Wilson 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. 2014, etc)</ref>. In this method the two radiative transfer equations (one for I and one for Q)(Eq.12) can be rewritten as a two-point boundary problem in the form of second order differential equations. Defining the mean-intensitylike and flux-like variables as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">         u(z, p, λ) = I + (z, p, λ) + I − (z, p, λ) 2 v(z, p, λ) = I + (z, p, λ) − I − (z, p, λ) 2 .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Note that u and v are vector quantities given by u I u Q , and v I v Q , respectively. Substituting eq. 13 in eq. 12, the later can be rewritten as two differential equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">         ∂u(z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) = v(z, p, λ) ∂v(z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) = u(z, p, λ) − S(z, p, λ).<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The combination of these two equations yields the second order differential radiative transfer equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">∂ 2 u(z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) 2 = u(z, p, λ) − S(z, p, λ).<label>(15)</label></formula><p>To solve the differential equation one needs boundary conditions. The upper boundary condition at r = r 1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) where we assume no incident radiation (I − ≡ 0) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">u = v,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>which, further, results in the following expression at the boundary condition z = z max :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∂u(z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) τ(z max ,p,λ)=0 = u(z max , p, λ),<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where z max = r 2 1 − p 2 . At the lower boundary two cases should be distinguished: the rays that intersect the core (p ≤ r ND , "core rays") from those that do not (p &gt; r ND , "surface rays") (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). For the core rays, we assume that radiation coming up from the bottom of the star is not polarized (Q + = 0), and we use the diffusion approximation for the intensity I + (µ) = S + µ ∂S ∂τ . For the surface rays we use a "reflecting" boundary I + = I − both for intensity and polarization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">           ∂u I (z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) τ max = I cor e − u I (z, p, λ) ∂u Q (z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) τ max = u Q (z, p, λ)<label>(18)</label></formula><p>for the core rays, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">           ∂u I (z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) τ max = 0 ∂u Q (z, p, λ) ∂τ(z, p, λ) τ max = 0<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Article number, page 3 of 13 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. kostogryz_arxiv for the surface rays. Therefore, we numerically solve the radiative transfer equation Eq.15 with boundary conditions Eq. 17, 18, 19, which, after making the variables discrete, leads to a block tri-diagonal system. More details on the solution of radiative transfer equation in spherical coordinates can be found in Peraiah (2001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Short characteristics solution</head><p>Short characteristics method for the numerical formal solution ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kunasz &amp; Auer 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mihalas et al. 1978</ref>) is based on the integral form of the radiative transfer equation, i.e. on the "formal" solution on the line segment connecting appropriately chosen upwind point U and local point L:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">I L = I U e −∆ + ∆ 0 S(t )e −t d t ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>where I L and I U are specific monochromatic intensities in the local and upwind point, respectively, ∆ is monochromatic optical path between the points and S is the source function. Now, to numerically solve the integral in Eq. 20, one usually assumes either low-order polynomial or spline behaviour of the source function on the interval UL, which leads to the following scheme for the formal solution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">I L = I U e −∆ + w U S U + w L S L + w L ′ S ′ L ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where w are weights which depend on ∆, and S ′ L is the derivative of the source function in the local point along the direction of the proparagation of radiation (i.e. 'along-theray'). This derivative is evaluated either explicitly or expressed through S L , S U and, in some schemes by means of an additional point, D, in the downwind direction of the ray propagation. In one-dimensional schemes, upwind and downwind points are chosen to be the previous and following grid points, with respect to the direction of propagation of the radiation. Originally, first or second order polynomials have been used to obtain weights in Eq. 21, but strictly monotonic Bezier splines lead to a better behaved numerical solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">de la Cruz Rodríguez &amp; Piskunov 2013</ref>). In the computations presented in this paper we have used Bezier splines of the second order. In the case of the linearly polarized radiation we are considering here, the formal solution for the Stokes vector is obtained by performing the formal solution for I and Q components separately. To recap this brief description, it is important to remember that, to obtain the specific intensity in the local point, one needs appropriate intensity in the upwind point and values of emissivity and opacity in upwind, local, and, depending on the numerical scheme, possibly downwind point.</p><p>As noted in the previous subsection, radiative transfer in spherical media is simplified by the use of the so called alongthe-ray approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Avrett &amp; Loeser 1984)</ref>. In this approach, short characteristics method is straightforward to apply. To obtain the full radiation field, the radiative transfer equation is solved ray-by-ray where rays are described by the impact parameter p. Consider the ray described by the line segment AB in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>: First notice that to formally solve the radiative transfer equations on segment AB is, because of the symmetry arguments, identical to solving the equation on segment AM in the direction A→M, with the boundary condition I A = 0, followed by the solution in the opposite direction, with the boundary</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">condition I ← M = I → M .</formula><p>This is identical to treating the segment AM as a single, one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere with two rays propagating in directions µ = −1 and µ = 1. The procedure for the ray A'B' is similar, except the boundary condition in B' is different and follows from the diffusion approximation <ref type="bibr">(Stokes I component)</ref>, or is equal to zero <ref type="bibr">(Stokes Q component)</ref>.</p><p>After the intensity has been computed at all points and for each ray, we can compute the source function using Eq. 5. The process is repeated until convergence. A standart way of accelerating this convergence is to use Jacobi iteration, also known as 'operator splitting', 'operator perturbation' or Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI). In the cases considered here it is not necessary as the optical thickness of the medium is rather moderate but in general it leads to an increase in convergence by a order of magnitude. For a review of ALI see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hubeny (2003)</ref>.</p><p>In principle, the only difference between the two approaches we have used is in the formal solution (Feautrier versus the short characteristics), which is, again, the most important part of the computation as the angular integration of the specific intensity in order to obtain the source function is rather straightforward. We now describe the stellar models we have used and discuss the main contributors to the continuum opacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Stellar models and opacities</head><p>Emergent polarized intensity is uniquely determined by the atmospheric model, i.e. the change of temperature and pressure with geometrical height in the atmosphere. We use spherically symmetric PHOENIX local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Husser et al. 2013</ref>). We consider effective temperatures in the range 4000 ≤ T eff ≤ 7000K in steps of 100K and surface gravities 1.0 ≤ log g ≤ 5.5 in steps of 0.5.

The main contributions to continuum opacities for several representative stellar model atmospheres are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.2</ref>. We consider contributions from: Thomson scattering on free electrons e − and Rayleigh scattering on HI, HeI, H 2 , CO, H 2 O, and other molecules (thin dashed lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.2</ref>). For calculating absorption opacities we take into account free-free (ff) and bound-free (bf) transitions in H − , HI, HeI, He − , H − 2 , H + 2 , and metal photoionization(thin solid lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.2</ref>).

In the deeper layers (for τ ≥ 1), absorption by H − is perhaps not the most dominant but still important contributor for solar type and cooler stars. For the hotter giant stars <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2e,f)</ref> absorption by H − is essential in the upper layers of the stellar atmosphere, while deeper in the atmosphere (τ ≥ 1) it decreases and becomes almost negligible. Another absorption opacity source that plays an important role in the deeper layers of atmosphere for solar type and cooler stars is H + 2 . For hotter giant stars, absorption by H + 2 is negligible and the most important  opacity source is neutral hydrogen HI. Note that these absorption opacities do not produce any polarization.</p><p>The main contributions to the polarization of the stellar continuum spectrum are scattering sources: Rayleigh scattering on neutral hydrogen HI (Chandrasekhar 1960) and on molecular hydrogen H 2 . The latter is more important in cooler atmosphere of dwarf stars <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. For cool giant stars the scattering by H 2 turns out to be less influential <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2c,d)</ref>. Instead, Thomson scattering by free electrons e − becomes more significant and even dominates in the hot and low-gravity stellar atmospheres <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2e,f</ref>).</p><p>The behavior of the total scattering (thick dashed line) and absorption (thick solid line) opacity is convenient for qualitative understanding the amount of scattering polarization in the atmosphere. The deeper is the 'critical' optical depth in the atmosphere where the scattering becomes dominant over the absorption, the higher linear polarization is to be expected. Therefore, according to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.2</ref>, for the stellar atmosphere with T eff = 4000K, log g = 1.5 and for the wavelength 4000Å, where the scattering dominates at τ ≤ 7 × 10 −1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.2c)</ref>, the polarization is expected to be very high, as well as for T e f f = 7000K, log g = 1.5 and for all wavelengths. On the contrary, for solar-type models with T eff = 5800K, log g = 4.5 at the same wavelength the critical height between scattering and absorption is about τ ≈ 10 −5 that should lead to smaller amount of polarized light. We will see that this is indeed the case (see Sect. 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We have independently (NK and IM) developed a spherical radiative transfer code to compute center-to-limb variation of intensity and scattering polarization in the continuum. Both codes are based on the iterative solution of the scattering problem but use two different methods for the numerical formal solution: Feautrier and short characteristics, described in the previous section. The codes usually agree down to the relative difference of few hundredth. In the following subsections we comment further on the differences. We also note that all the results in the paper have been double-checked using both codes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Test of our codes</head><p>3.1.1. Model atmosphere with equal absorption and scattering opacity</p><p>In this subsection we describe the test of both our approaches to the formal solution presented above. We consider an isothermal spherical atmosphere with inner and outer boundaries at 1 and 30 stellar radii, respectively, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Avrett &amp; Loeser (1984)</ref>. The total opacity (k c +σ c ) is given by C /r 2 , where the constant C is determined by the requirement that the total radial optical depth of the atmosphere is equal to 4. This results in C = 120/29, and then radial optical depth is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">τ = 120 29 1 r − 1 30 (22)</formula><p>We assume a constant monochromatic scattering coefficient σ c = 0.5. Then, it follows that k c ≡ 1 − σ c = 0.5. For the given model atmosphere, i.e. variation of temperature, opacity and scattering coefficient with radius (note that, contrary to the plane-parallel case where τ is chosen as an independent coordinate, we actually require the geometrical scale expressed in physical units), we can self-consistently solve the scattering problem and obtain values of the polarized source function at all points in the atmosphere as well as the angular variation of emergent polarized intensity (I and Q). There are no available solutions of this specific test case for the polarized radiation so we start by comparing the mean intensity defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">J = I (µ)dµ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>between the two codes and also with other results found in the literature.</p><p>The dependence J (r ) is well-known for this test case of the spherical atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mihalas et al. 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rogers 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Avrett &amp; Loeser 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gros et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atanackovic-Vukmanovic 2003)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3a</ref> presents the results of calculations by Feautrier method (solid lines) and short characteristics (dashed lines) as compared to other studies: <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mihalas et al.

Solid line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3b</ref> describes the residuals between our two codes, which are calculated according to Eq. 24, where J ≡ J SC is the solution with short characteristics method, which is about 0.5% of most. Thus, we can conclude that for the test model atmosphere, our calculations agree within 0.5%.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Residuals = J − J F J F × 100%.<label>(24)</label></formula><p>In addition to the mean intensity, we are interested in the relative difference between our two approaches when computing CLVI and CLVP for this test model atmosphere. The comparison is presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a,c</ref>. The results obtained with Feautrier technique are shown with solid lines, and the one obtained with short characteristics method are presented by dashed line. The residuals both for CLVI and CLVP is given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b,d</ref>. The differences between our codes for the intensity are very small (order of percent). The relative difference for the polarization is also very small for the major part of the Q/I (µ) curve. It is only for µ very close to 1 that our codes show more significant difference, up to 20%. This is due to the different nature of the formal solution: short characteristics method using Bezier splines imposes monotonicity of the interpolant (in this case the source function). This approach suppresses numerical overshooting but can potentially decrease the accuracy. In the Feautrier formal solution, on the other hand, it is implicitly assumed that the source function behaves as the second order polynomial. The difference between the two approaches is especially prominent in the cases where the source function varies a lot between the adjacent depth points which is the case here. Namely, for the ray with emergent µ close to (but not equal to) one, 'local' µ changes significantly along the ray path. This leads to the significant variation of the polarized source function S Q as it strongly depends on the scattering angle. This, in turn, leads to different results for the emergent intensity after the formal integration. However, these differences become important only for the rays with µ → 1, which Article number, page 6 of 13 N. M. <ref type="bibr">Kostogryz et al.:</ref> CLV of intensity and polarization in continuum spectra of FGK stars for spherical atmospheres. are of no interest for our investigation as the polarization there is very small. In the remainder of the paper, we compare the results of the two codes for the realistic model atmospheres. We found that the relative differences are much lower, down to a few percent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Purely scattering atmosphere</head><p>Similar to our previous study  as a test of our codes we investigate a center-to-limb variation of linear polarization in the case of a purely scattering atmosphere. We set the scattering coefficient equal to the total opacity, while the absorption coefficient is zero. After such assumptions, the intensity and polarization of the outgoing continuum radiation become independent of the frequency and of all thermodynamic properties and, therefore, any initial plane-parallel atmosphere can be used.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chandrasekhar (1960)</ref>, who solved the radiative transfer equation for an ideal purely scattering atmosphere in the plane-parallel approximation, the polarization increases from the center to the limb and can reach up to 11.7%. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peraiah (1975)</ref> solved the radiative transfer equation in spherically symmetric purely scattering homogeneous medium for different ratios of extended atmosphere radius to the radius of stellar "surface" and showed that for the spherical atmosphere the CLVP can be higher than for plane-parallel atmosphere. We solve the radiative transfer equation for several Phoenix stellar model atmospheres with effective temperatures of 4000K and 5800K, log g of 4.5, and 1.5 and for two different wavelengths of 4000 and 7000Å, in which the scattering and absorption coefficients are redefined to get a purely scattering atmosphere. In the left panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> the CLVP for different models with T eff = 5800K, log g = 4.5 at 4000Å (dashed line), T eff = 4000K, log g = 4.5 at 7000Å (dash-dotted line) and T eff = 5800K, log g = 1.5 at 4000Å (solid line) are shown. The star symbols describe the exact solution for a purely scattering plane-parallel atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chandrasekhar 1960</ref>). For stars which do not have extended atmospheres (e.g., solar type stars), we can detect small deviation of CLVP from planeparallel atmosphere only at the limb, while extended atmospheres show much higher polarization. Here, we notice that the scattering polarization emerging from a purely scattering spherical atmopshere depends on the extension of the atmosphere. For a more extended atmosphere, i.e. smaller log g , we obtain larger differences with respect to plane-parallel geometry. In particular the polarization is higher, which agrees with <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peraiah (1975)</ref>.</p><p>Following the solar terminology, the limb position of the star is defined as a line of sight where the largest gradient of CLVI occurs. Note that the limb position can only be defined using the solution of radiative transfer equation in a spherical atmosphere. Therefore, to explain limb darkening measurements we need to find the limb position and recalculate all µ taking into account that µ at the limb should be equal to zero (i.e. we make a difference between "geometrical" and "observational" µ). In the right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> we present the same curves but for recalculated values of µ. In this panel we still see small difference of a theoretical extended atmosphere (solid line) from Chandrasekhar's solution, while dwarf star atmospheres with different effective temperatures and for different wavelengths show very good agreement with the exact solution for plane-parallel atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chandrasekhar 1960)</ref>. This shows that scattering has been correctly calculated in the codes. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Center-to-limb variation of polarization for the pure scattering atmosphere.

Therefore, in this subsection we are going to investigate how our calculations fit the solar photometric and polarimetric observations.</p><p>Before exploring how our calculations fit the observations, the difference between our two codes is studied for the solar atmosphere to estimate the difference in numerical calculations.

We show that our calculation (solid line) represents the observation (dashed line) very well for 5000Å, while there are small discrepancies for 4000Å and 6000Å that can be associated either with natural variations of the solar brightness or with imperfect solar model atmosphere or with polynomial interpolation of the observations. We conclude that the CLVI for both plane-parallel and spherical atmospheres can be used for interpretating solar observations.

We compare our single wavelength (4500Å) continuum computation for Phoenix spherical stellar models with other studies for the B filter <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 9)</ref>. Note that the filter includes contributions from many spectral lines, especially for cooler atmospheres, so we don't expect a perfect match.</p><p>As is seen from the first panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.9</ref>, where four various limb darkening curves are presented, the different stellar atmospheric models and different authors present diverse results that can be used for testing stellar model atmospheres. As expected for hot stars we can reproduce broadband simulations well since there are not many spectral lines and the continuum dominates. At the very limb the curve from Claret et al. (2013)(solid line) has artificial negative limb darkening that may come from the fitting with 4-parameters and not from calculations.</p><p>Because the various stellar models provide different results, in the second and the third panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 9</ref> we compare our calculations with those from non-linear limb darkening law <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Claret et al. 2013</ref>) for the same input spherical Phoenix stellar models. In our previous study of CLVI with plane parallel approximation ) we discussed that the model atmosphere with the same surface gravity and with lower temperature than 5800K that showed a larger deviation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Claret et al.

However, analyzing the CLVI calculated for different surface gravities, we can also add to the previous conclusion that low gravity star show a larger discrepancy between CLVI in the continuum at 4500Å and the one calculated in the broadband B filter. Naturally, to explain broadband observations of the CLVI we need to take all the spectral lines contributing to the passband of the filter into account, while our calculations are useful for explaining the monochromatic measurements at the continuum level.</p><p>In order to estimate the maximum difference between our two numerical approaches, we solve the radiative transfer equation for the most extended model atmosphere with log g = 1.0, effective temperature 4000K at wavelength 4000Å. The relative difference between two our approaches is about 1.0−1.5% in intensity and about 2.0−3.0% in polarization that is smaller than the observational error bars, which can be 10% or more even for solar measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wiehr &amp; Bianda 2003</ref>).  For plane-parallel atmospheres, the center to limb variation of intensity, assuming isotropic scattering, is almost identical to CLVI from a solution with dipole scattering (i.e. one including polarization). In order to check if this holds for extended spherical atmospheres, we calculate CLVI for isotropic and anisotropic scattering, that is, excluding and including polarization, respectively. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> we present the results of our calculations for Phoenix model atmosphere with T eff = 4000K, log g = 1.0 and wavelength λ = 4000Å. For this model the relative difference between these two calculation for CLVI is about 8% at the limb, while for more compact stellar model atmospheres this effect is smaller.</p><p>We solve the radiative transfer equation for polarized light taking spherical symmetry of a star into account for the grid of spherical Phoenix model atmospheres within the range of effective temperatures from 4000 to 7000K at steps of 100K and for log g from 1.0 to 5.5 at steps of 0.5. For different wavelengths, effective temperatures, log g and various position on the stellar disk µ, we present the values of CLVI in <ref type="table">Table 1 and  of CLVP in Table 2</ref>. In addition we present µ l imb that is equal to the calculated µ where the largest gradient in the limb darkening curve occurs and corresponds to the real radius of a star, which is calculated and presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> as well.

For the fixed surface gravity (log g = 4.5) and the wavelength (λ = 4000Å), give as titles in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11a</ref>, the cooler atmosphere shows larger CLVP. Fixing the surface gravity and temperature, one can investigate the behavior of continuum polarization in different wavelengths. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11b</ref> shows that at shorter wavelengths higher polarization can be obtained. However, there are some cases in our grid of model atmospheres where we have larger polarization for longer wavelengths and hotter temperatures. It is true for giant and supergiant stars with log g ≤ 1.5 where the main source of scattering opacity is Thomson scattering on free electrons (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2e, f)</ref>, which is independent on wavelength but increasing with increasing temperature. The last panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 11c)</ref> shows that the higher gravity of a star leads to lower linear polarization.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> we present the distribution of integrated value of polarization within the range of µ = 0.0 − 0.3 depending on effective temperature and gravity of a star at λ = 4000Å. We see that polarization degree depends on the atmosphere extension (i.e. scale height), which varies with the effective temperatures and surface gravities. As is seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>, the coolest stars with log g = 3.0 − 4.5 show larger polarization, while for very compact dwarf stars with log g = 5.0 − 5.5 the highest polarization is seen for T eff ≈ 4200 − 4600K (depending on log g ) and decreases for smaller temperatures. For giant and supergiant stars (log g &lt; 3.0), the situation is different. The limb polarization is the largest for the hottest stars where the Thomson scattering plays an important role in opacity, then it decreases for the stars with effective temperatures of about 4500−5500K (depending on log g ), and cooler stars again show an increase of polarization because of Rayleigh scattering that dominates in scattering opacity (see, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). For coolest and most compact dwarfs limb polarization decreases. This complex behavior can be explained by the interplay of opacity and geometry that depends on the variation of physical parame-      ters in the atmosphere, such as effective temperature and density.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">Wavelength, Å T, K log g µ l imb R ⋆ /R ⊙ I (µ)/I (1.0) 0.01</formula><p>Therefore, we conclude that for the range of effective temperatures of 4000 − 7000K and surface gravities of 3.0 -5.0, that were also considered in our previous study ) with the plane-parallel approximation, the continuum polarization is the largest for lowgravity cool stars. The extension of the grid of stellar model atmospheres, especially to smaller log g , shows the increasing of CLVP for hot stars, where the Thomson scattering becomes dominating in scattering opacities and also increasing of CLVP for cool stars, where Rayleigh scattering on HI is still the most important scattering opacity. For the range of temperatures of 45000−5500K (depending on log g ) the decreasing of limb polarization in continuum occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we developed two independent codes for solving radiative transfer equation of polarized light in continuum considering spherical stellar atmospheres and presented the center-to-limb variations of intensity and polarization for the range of effective temperatures of 4000 − 7000K, surface gravities of log g = 1.0 − 5.5, and for several wavelengths (4000, 4500, 5000, 6000, 7000Å). We showed that two different formal solutions, such as Feautrier method and short characteristics, provide very similar results within small deviations that are discussed in the paper.</p><p>For the test isothermal model atmosphere with inner and outer boundaries at 1 and 30 stellar radii and constant opacity (σ = 0.5) we calculated the mean intensity and compared our results with the already published values. It was shown that the discrepancies for all results are about 1 − 2% that can be explained by different discretizations in r and different approximations of source function. As we have the same discretization in r but still different approximations for description of source function, the differences between our results is within 0.5%. For this test model the CLVI and CLVP calculations with two different formal solutions were compared and showed that the intensity varies within 0.4%, while the deviation in polarization is larger. Anyway, for the most extended real atmosphere the deviations between the two codes is approximately 2−3%.</p><p>For the solar atmosphere we obtained very good agreement for CLVI and CLVP with observations. Moreover, we compare our previous calculations for a plane-parallel atmosphere with calculations in a spherical atmosphere and showed that CLVI in a spherical atmosphere is more informative at the limb and provides information about the radius of the Sun The CLVP in a spherical atmosphere for different models have larger deviations than in plane-parallel atmosphere and can be used for testing solar model atmospheres.</p><p>For extended stellar atmospheres (giant and super-giant stars) with log g = 1.0 − 2.5 all models provide large polarization with two maxima for cooler and for hotter atmospheres. These two maxima in polarization consist of two different scattering processes for hot and cool atmospheres.
