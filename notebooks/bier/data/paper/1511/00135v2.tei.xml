				<p>Many giant exoplanets in close orbits have observed radii which exceed theoretical predictions. One suggested explanation for this discrepancy is heat deposited deep inside the atmospheres of these &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;. Here, we study extended power sources which distribute heat from the photosphere to the deep interior of the planet. Our analytical treatment is a generalization of a previous analysis of localized &quot;point sources&quot;. We model the deposition profile as a power law in the optical depth and find that planetary cooling and contraction halt when the internal luminosity (i.e. cooling rate) of the planet drops below the heat deposited in the planet&apos;s convective region. A slowdown in the evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources which do not extend to the planet&apos;s center. We estimate the Ohmic dissipation resulting from the interaction between the atmospheric winds and the planet&apos;s magnetic field, and apply our analytical model to Ohmically heated planets. Our model can account for the observed radii of most inflated planets which have equilibrium temperatures ≈ 1500 K − 2500 K, and are inflated to a radius ≈ 1.6R J. However, some extremely inflated planets remain unexplained by our model. We also argue that Ohmically inflated planets have already reached their equilibrium phase, and no longer contract. Following Wu &amp; Lithwick who argued that Ohmic heating could only suspend and not reverse contraction, we calculate the time it takes Ohmic heating to re-inflate a cold planet to its equilibrium configuration. We find that while it is possible to re-inflate a cold planet, the re-inflation timescales are longer by a factor of ≈ 30 than the cooling time.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The discovery of extra-solar planets in the last two decades has been accompanied with a variety of surprises, which challenge standard planetary formation and evolution theories that were originally inspired by our solar system. One of these mysteries is the detection of close-orbit planets with radii as large as ∼ 2R J , where R J is the radius of Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Chan et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hartman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2013)</ref>. Theoretical evolution models predict that isolated gas giants older than ∼ 1 Gyr cool and contract to a radius of about 1.0R J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burrows et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ginzburg &amp; Sari 2015)</ref>. The proximity of the observed planets to their parent stars imposes a strong stellar irradiation that induces a deep radiative envelope at the outer edge of the otherwise fully convective planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guillot et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006</ref>). This radiative layer slows down the evolutionary cooling of the planet compared with an isolated one, resulting in a higher bulk entropy and radius at a given age <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Burrows et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chabrier et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marleau &amp; Cumming 2014)</ref>. However, at least some of the observed hot Jupiters have radii which exceed the theoretical predictions, even with stellar irradiation taken into account ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liu et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>There have been several suggested explanations to the radius discrepancy (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baraffe et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baraffe et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fortney &amp; Nettelmann 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2013</ref>, for comprehensive reviews), varying from enhanced atmospheric opacities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. 2007</ref>), suppression of convective heat loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Chabrier &amp; Baraffe 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Leconte &amp; Chabrier 2012)</ref>, or an extra power source inside the planet's atmosphere. In this work we focus on the effects of an extra power source in the atmosphere. Possible heat sources include tidal dissipation due to orbital eccentricity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bodenheimer et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bodenheimer et al. , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gu et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Winn &amp; Holman 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jackson et al. 2008</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liu et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ibgui &amp; Burrows 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Miller et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ibgui et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ibgui et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Leconte et al. 2010</ref>), "thermal tides" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arras &amp; Socrates 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">,b, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Socrates 2013</ref>), Ohmic heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Batygin &amp; Stevenson 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Perna et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Perna et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rauscher &amp; Menou 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rogers &amp; Showman 2014)</ref>, turbulent mixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Youdin &amp; Mitchell 2010)</ref>, and dissipation of kinetic energy of the atmospheric circulation .</p><p>The influence of the additional heat on the planet's cooling history (and therefore on its radius) increases with its deposition depth inside the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baraffe et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref>. In a previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ginzburg &amp; Sari 2015</ref>; hereafter Paper I) we gave an intuitive analytic description of the effects of additional power sources on hot Jupiters, which explains this result and reproduces the numerical survey of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spiegel &amp; Burrows (2013)</ref>. However, Paper I and previous numerical works focus on the specific case of localized "point-source" energy deposition. In the current work we study a more general scenario, in which the deposited heat is distributed over a range of depths in the atmosphere (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The outline of the paper is as follows. We summarize the results of Paper I for localized power sources in Section 2, and generalize them to extended sources in Section 3. In Section 4 we apply our model to the specific case of Ohmic dissipation, and quantitatively estimate the radii of Ohmically heated hot Jupiters, with a comparison to observations. In Section 5 we discuss the possibility of re-inflating a cold planet. Our main conclusions are summarized in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">POINT SOURCE ENERGY DEPOSITION</head><p>In Paper I we analyzed the effects of localized heat sources deep in the atmosphere on the cooling rate of irradiated gas giants. We summarize the analysis here because a similar technique is used in Section 3. Our model is one-dimensional and does not differentiate between the day and night sides of the planet (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2013)</ref>. We first discuss the effects of stellar irradiation, and then incorporate an additional heat source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Irradiated Planets</head><p>Irradiated planets, in contrast with isolated ones, develop a deep radiative outer layer which governs the convective heat loss rate (i.e., internal luminosity) of the interior ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guillot et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006</ref>). The radiative-convective transition and the internal luminosity are best analyzed in the <ref type="bibr">[τ, U ]</ref> plane, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">τ (r) = ∞ r κρdr ′<label>(1)</label></formula><p>denoting the optical depth at radius r, and U ≡ a rad T 4 is the radiative energy density. The density, temperature, and opacity are denoted by ρ, T , and κ, respectively, and a rad is the radiation constant. Assuming power-law opacities κ ∝ ρ a T b (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Youdin &amp; Mitchell 2010)</ref>, the convective interior is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U U c = τ τ c β ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with U c ≡ a rad T 4 c denoting the central radiation energy density, determined by the central temperature T c , τ c ∼ κ c ρ c R, with κ c denoting the estimate for the central opacity, if the power-law opacity could be extrapolated to the center, ρ c denoting the central density, and R is the planet's radius. The power β is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">β = 4 b + 1 + n(a + 1) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where n is the polytropic index. The radiative envelope is characterized by the equilibrium temperature on the planet surface (i.e., photosphere)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T eq = (1 − A) 1/4 T ⊙ R ⊙ 2D 1/2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with T ⊙ and R ⊙ denoting the stellar temperature and radius, respectively, and where D and A are the planet's orbital distance and albedo, respectively (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guillot et al. 1996</ref>). This equilibrium temperature defines an energy density of U eq ≡ a rad T 4 eq , and luminosity L eq ≡ 4πR 2 σ SB T 4 eq , where σ SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The radiative profile is given by the diffusion approximation (valid for τ ≫ 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">U = U eq + 3 c L int 4πR 2 τ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where c is the speed of light and L int is the internal luminosity. According to the Schwarzschild criterion, convective instability develops when the radiative temperature profile is steeper than the adiabatic one. By differentiating Equations (2) and (5) we find that a profile with β &gt; 1 is fully radiative, while for β &lt; 1 (which is the relevant scenario; see Paper I) convection sets in at the radiativeconvective boundary, located at an optical depth of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">τ rad ∼ L eq L int ∼ τ c U eq U c 1/β ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the radiative energy density is U eq /(1 − β).</p><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(6)</ref> shows that increasing stellar irradiation decreases the internal luminosity and deepens the penetration of the radiative layer, which is isothermal to within a factor of (1 − β) −1/4 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Guillot et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burrows et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Youdin &amp; Mitchell 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spiegel &amp; Burrows 2013)</ref>. These results can be also obtained graphically by drawing a radiative tangent with a slope 3L int /(4πR 2 c) from the point [0, U eq ] to the convective profile (see Paper I).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Power Deposition</head><p>In Paper I we parametrized an energy point-source with its power L dep and some deposition optical depth τ dep . This source alters the radiative profile of Equation (5)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dU dτ = 3 4πR 2 c · L tot ≡ L int + L dep τ &lt; τ dep L int τ &gt; τ dep ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>with L tot denoting the total luminosity for τ &lt; τ dep . If we focus on intense deposition L dep ≫ L int , then we may approximate L tot ≈ L dep , and by analogy with Equation (6), convection sets in at τ b ∼ L eq /L dep (we reserve the notation τ rad to the inner radiative-convective transition, as discussed below). In the regime L dep τ dep /L eq 1 (necessary for a significant effect, see Paper I) a convective layer appears between τ b and τ dep , which we distinguish as the secondary convective region. The internal luminosity is found by drawing a radiative tangent from [τ dep , U (τ dep )] to the main interior convective profile, with the transition point denoted by τ rad . This is equivalent to drawing a tangent from [0, U iso ], with</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">U iso U eq ≈ 1 1 − β U (τ dep ) U (τ b ) ∼ L dep τ dep L eq β ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where U (τ dep ) is adiabatically related to U (τ b ). Therefore, the results of Section 2.1 are reproduced, but with U iso instead of U eq (note the change in notation of the deep isotherm from U eff eq in Paper I to U iso here). Combining Equations (6) and <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> shows that the internal luminosity is reduced from a value of L 0 int without heat sources to</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L int L 0 int ∼ 1 + L dep τ dep L eq −(1−β) ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where we have interpolated with the weak heating regime (L dep τ dep /L eq 1). The conclusion is that additional heat sources slow the cooling rate if deposited deep enough.</p></div>

Specifically, hot Jupiters irradiated by an equilibrium temperature of T eq ≈ 1500 K are expected to reach a radius of R ≈ 1.3R J at this age (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liu et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ginzburg &amp; Sari 2015)</ref>.</p><p>As explained in Section 2.2, deep heat deposition slows down the cooling rate even more, resulting in an additional radius inflation at a given age.

When the planet reaches this equilibrium temperature, cooling and contraction stop entirely, and an enlarged equilibrium radius is retained.</p></div>

The cooling history of the planet until it reaches this equilibrium state is unaffected by the deposited energy (see Appendix A for a more general discussion).

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> we present a schematic plot of the current field lines, which must form closed loops (since ∇ · J = 0). The H/R current drop is intuitively understood due to the folding of the current lines inside the wind zone, in order to eliminate their radial component at the surface (note that the wind zone depth is exaggerated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>. Alternatively, the drop can be understood by noting that the condition ∇ · J = 0 leads to J r /H ∼ J θ /R (with J θ , J r denoting the tangential and radial components of the current) in the wind zone and that J r transitions continuously below the wind zone, where it is comparable in magnitude to the tangential component. Since J(r) ∝ (r/R) l−1 below the wind zone, the current surface density is roughly constant there (while the pressure varies by orders of magnitude) as long as the radius is not much smaller than R. The decrease of the current, and therefore the Ohmic dissipation, at r ≪ R is irrelevant for the planet's inflation, because the density, and therefore the temperature, approach their maximal (central) values at r ∼ R/2 in a polytropic profile (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Peebles 1964)</ref>. We note that our two layer model is very similar to the three layer analytical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>. Instead of a discontinuous jump in the conductivity with depth (between their middle and inner layers), we use a smooth power-law, as described in Section 4.2, which better represents numerical conductivity profiles calculated in previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming 2012)</ref>, including <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref> itself.</p><p>The acceleration of a fluid element due to the Lorentz force is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">f = 1 ρ J × B c .<label>(23)</label></formula><p>By combining Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref> we find the mag-  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2011)</ref>, we estimate the magnetic field of the planet using the Elsasser number criterion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Christensen et al. 2009</ref>, for an alternative), which arises from a balance between the Lorentz and Coriolis forces at the core</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">netic drag deceleration f = − B 2 ρc 2 σσ v.<label>(24)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_26">B 2 ρ c c 2 = Ω σ c ,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where the Lorentz force is given by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref>, but with the conductivity σ c and density ρ c of the planet's interior instead of the atmosphere.

For example, one effect which is taken into account in these simulations, but neglected in our following analysis, is the induced (by currents) magnetic field, which should be added to the planet's dipolar field. Nonetheless, we make a rough order of magnitude estimate here, following . The winds are driven by a horizontal temperature difference ∆T T eq between the day and night sides of the tidally locked planet, leading to a forcing acceleration of (c 2 s /R)(∆T /T eq ), with c s ∼ (k B T eq /m p ) 1/2 denoting the speed of sound in the atmosphere. This forcing is balanced by both the Coriolis force (the classical thermal wind equation; see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2010</ref>) and the magnetic drag ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>; Menou 2012)</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">c 2 s R ∆T T eq = Ωv 1 + σ σ c ρ c ρ ,<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where the magnetic drag is given by Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref>. Unlike Menou <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2012)</ref>, we neglect the nonlinear advective term v∇v ∼ v 2 /R with respect to the Coriolis force, since the Rossby number is Ro ∼ v/(ΩR) &lt; 1, as evident from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2010</ref>). Note that Ro ∼ 1 only when the magnetic drag is negligible, and the temperature difference is maximal ∆T ≈ T eq , since (by coincidence) the sound speed and rotation velocity are similar c s ∼ ΩR ∼ 10 5 cm s −1 . Therefore, a low Rossby number approximation is more adequate for the general case (∆T ≤ T eq , and with magnetic drag included). A more careful analysis takes into account the dependence of the Rossby number (the ratio between the advective and Coriolis terms) on the latitude φ: Ro = v/(2ΩR sin φ). Evidently, our low Rossby number approximation is valid except for a narrow ring around the equator φ → 0, therefore providing a reasonable estimate for the average atmospheric behavior. An alternative analysis, relevant close to the equator, and in which the advective term is dominant, is presented in Appendix B. As seen in Appendix B, both methods lead to qualitatively similar results (see also Menou 2012). Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> indicates the existence of two regimes: an unmagnetized regime, where the forcing is balanced by the Coriolis force, and a magnetized regime, in which the magnetic drag is the balancing force. The transition between the regimes is when σ/σ c ∼ ρ/ρ c . Due to the sharp increase of the conductivity with temperature (see Section 4.2), the magnetized regime corresponds to high equilibrium temperatures. Using the conductivities calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming (2012)</ref>, we estimate the transition equilibrium temperature at T eq ≈ 1500 K, inside the observationally relevant range (see Menou 2012, for similar results).</p><p>The temperature difference ∆T is determined, in the simplest analysis, by the ratio of advective to radiative timescales <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Menou 2012)</ref>, with higher-order effects taken into account by more comprehensive treatments ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Komacek &amp; Showman 2015)</ref>.

This result explains observed day-night temperature differences (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. 2009</ref>), which are smaller than T eq , but only by an order of unity factor.  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Menou (2012)</ref> obtain the same result using a simpler prescription for the radiative timescale, which is different by a factor of τ and valid only for τ = 1, coinciding with Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref> in this case.

Interestingly, Equation (28) indicates that for low temperatures (and therefore, in the unmagnetized regime) the relative day-night temperature difference at the photosphere (τ ∼ 1) falls rapidly with decreasing temperatures ∆T /T eq ∝ T 5 eq , where we neglect the weak dependence of the photospheric opacity on the temperature, and substitute Ω ∝ T 3 eq (though at large enough separations the planets may not be tidally locked). Consequently, we predict that warm Jupiters, with T eq 10 3 K will have very small daynight temperature differences, compared to hot Jupiters, with T eq 10 3 K, which are in the saturated regime ∆T ∼ T eq of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref>. This prediction, which is robust to the Rossby number regime, as seen by Equation (B2), can be tested against observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kammer et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wong et al. 2015</ref>). Using Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(28)</ref>, we find the decay of the velocity with depth v ∝ ∆T ∝ κ/τ 2 ∝ P −5/2 , with P denoting the pressure, and utilizing the relation P/g ∼ τ /κ (we neglect the mild change of σ/ρ with depth in the atmosphere for the magnetized case).</p><p>The velocity drops as a power law in pressure, which increases exponentially with a scale height H, allowing us to replace the discontinuous drop in the current surface density in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref> model with a continuous drop from an outer J = J 0 , given by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref>, to a roughly constant J = J 0 (H/R) in the interior.

In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref> and to this work, the model of Batygin et al. (2011) does not predict a drop in the current at the edge of the wind zone. This results in their overestimation of the deposition at depth, though it is partially balanced by their slightly steeper heating profile (see Section 4.2).</p></div>

The electric conductivity in the outer layers of the planet is determined by the ionization level of alkali metals, with Potassium dominating the results, due to its low ionization energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Huang &amp; Cumming 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming (2012)</ref> calculated the Potassium ionization level using the Saha equation, and arrived at the scaling of the conductivity with pressure and temperature. For a simple power-law estimate, we evaluate their scaling (their Equation A3) at the radiative convective boundary as σ ∝ T 7.5 ρ −0.5 (the exponential dependence on the temperature is approximated as a power law with index = d ln σ(T )/d ln T , evaluated at the radiativeconvective boundary), and obtain the relation σ ∝ P 0.8 , where we used P ∝ T n+1 , with n ≈ 5 from the equation of state of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref>. This polytropic equation of state is a good approximation in the relevant temperature range, as seen, for example, in  <ref type="formula">)</ref> equation of state. We note that in Paper I we used a different n ≈ 2, relevant for lower radiative-convective boundary temperatures that characterize less irradiated and unheated planets (the results of Paper I depend weakly on n). Although our modeling of the conductivity as a power-law is an ad-hoc simplifying approximation, realistic conductivities exhibit a (roughly) power-law dependence on the pressure level inside the planet (see, e.g., <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>). Using Equation (30) and ρ ∝ P n/(n+1) , we find that the specific Ohmic dissipation scales as dL/dm ∝ P −1.6 . This scaling is in between the somewhat steeper scaling of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. (2011)</ref> and the flatter scaling of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Ohmic Dissipation Efficiency</head><p>In this section we estimate the efficiency ǫ in the Ohmic dissipation scenario, following the arguments of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming (2012)</ref>. As we discuss below (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), this efficiency is dominated by the dissipation in the wind zone, and is higher than the effective efficiency ǫ eff (which is related to ǫ below) used to evaluate the deep energy deposition. Using Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref>, the efficiency, which is defined as the dissipated energy rate in units of the stellar irradiation, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">ǫ = (v/c) 2 σB 2 H σ SB T 4 eq = (σ/σ c ) ρ c v 2 HΩ σ SB T 4 eq ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where we have eliminated the magnetic field using Equation (25). This result can also be understood by dividing the kinetic energy by the magnetic drag's stopping time (ρc 2 /B 2 )σ −1 , which is obtained from Equation (24). It is instructive to consider the variation of the dominant term in the efficiency σv 2 with conductivity, while assuming all other parameters constant.

This maximal efficiency is similar to Menou (2012), who neglected the Coriolis force. Menou (2012) also decoupled the magnetic field strength from the rotation of the planet (and therefore the equilibrium temperature). In our approach, on the other hand, the magnetic field is related to Ω ∝ T 3 eq through the Elssaser number condition, as described above. By taking this relation into account, incorporating the scaling of conductivity σ with temperature from Section 4.2, and considering the dependence of all other variables: H, ρ, and c s on the temperature, Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_35">yield ǫ ∝ T 3 eq T eq &lt; T m T −6 eq T eq &gt; T m ,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>with T m ≈ 1500 K denoting the transition between the magnetized and unmagnetized regimes. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(34)</ref> has the same qualitative behavior as the more illustrative Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(32)</ref>, which demonstrates the dependence of the efficiency on the conductivity σ (which is the dominant factor, due to its sharp increase with temperature).  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.-Schematic Ohmic heating profile (logarithmic scale) of a hot Jupiter.

Nevertheless, we can use Section 3, by replacing ǫ with ǫ eff . The first segment, characterized by a flat deposition due to the increase of conductivity with depth (since L ∝ J 2 /σ, J ∝ σv in the wind zone, and v is constant for τ &lt; τ 0 ), extends to τ 0 ∼ 1. Beyond τ 0 , the velocity drops as v ∝ P −5/2 , so J ∝ P −1.7 ∝ τ −0.9 until τ 1 = τ 0 (H/R) −1.1 , beyond which J is roughly constant.

In contrast to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming 2012</ref>; Menou 2012) our treatment is valid for optical depths above unity. We found that the winds decay as a power law with pressure, allowing us to replace the discontinuity of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref> with a continuous drop, and to relate the wind zone depth z wind (which is an arbitrary parameter in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref> to the atmospheric scale height.</p><p>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>, we do not choose a constant fiducial wind speed, and therefore a constant efficiency, but rather calculate the wind speed by comparing the thermal forcing (due to the day-night temperature difference) to the Coriolis force (relevant for T eq 1500 K) and to the magnetic drag (relevant for T eq 1500 K). This analysis leads us to replace the constant ǫ with an efficiency which rises to a maximum of ǫ ≈ 0.3 at T eq ≈ 1500 K, and then drops at higher equilibrium temperatures due to the reduction of wind speeds by the magnetic drag. Our variable ǫ model is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Menou (2012)</ref>, with two main differences: we consider the balance between the thermal forcing and the Coriolis force instead of the nonlinear advective term v∇v (our low Rossby number approximation is more appropriate in this case, see Section 4.1), and we do not treat the planet's magnetic field as a free parameter, but rather couple it to the planet's rotation rate, and therefore to its equilibrium temperature. Despite these differences, our model qualitatively reproduces the results of Menou (2012), as seen by comparing our Equation (34) to their <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>Another new ingredient in our work is the analytic translation of a given heat dissipation efficiency to an inflated planet radius. Most previous studies calculate the Ohmically heated planet evolution using stellar evolution codes, with the exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming (2012)</ref>, who numerically integrate a simplified model based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Arras &amp; Bildsten (2006)</ref>. In this work, however, we calculate the planet's evolution using a generalization of a simple analytic theory, derived in Paper I. This analytical approach provides a broader understanding of the scaling laws governing hot-Jupiter inflation.</p><p>One interesting example of an insight gained by our analytical model is the qualitative shape of the R(T eq ) curve plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Specifically, how come the inflation increases with temperature, while the heating efficiency ǫ(T eq ) drops due to the magnetic drag at high temperatures, as explained above? The answer is obtained by considering Equation (35), which indicates that the inflation is determined by two competing factors. While the efficiency decreases, the increasing H − opacity pushes the radiative-convective boundary (in the final equilibrium state) to lower pressures (since P/g ∼ τ /κ), raising the temperatures of the inner adiabat (this effect is represented by the T b eq term in the equation). Quantitatively, due to its high maximal efficiency ǫ max ≈ 0.3, our model predicts somewhat more inflated planets in the range 1500 K ≤ T eq ≤ 2000 K, compared with the constant ǫ = 3% model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>, as seen by comparing our <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> and their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 5</ref>. However, the differences between the two models are modest (≈ 0.1R J ), due to the relatively weak dependence of the inflated radius on the efficiency ∆R ∞ ∝ ǫ 0.3 , the sharp drop of the efficiency at T eq 1500 K, evident from Equation (34), and the somewhat flatter heating profile of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>. The model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. (2011)</ref>, on the other hand, predicts higher inflations, due to the absence of a drop in their heating profile (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Nonetheless, by comparing our <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> to their <ref type="figure">Figures 6-8</ref>, we find that the differences are partially compensated by the lower efficiencies ǫ ≤ 5% and the somewhat steeper heating profile of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. (2011)</ref>, and amount to ≈ 0.3R J for 1M J planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">PLANET RE-INFLATION</head><p>In the previous sections we assumed that planets cool and contract from high temperatures (and therefore large radii) under the influence of both stellar irradiation and additional power deposition (e.g. Ohmic dissipation). However, another possible scenario (due to migration on long timescales, for example) involves dissipation mechanisms that come into play only once the planet has already cooled and contracted to a relatively small radius (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013, and references within)</ref>.</p><p>It is clear from the discussion in Section 3 that the final equilibrium temperature profile of the planet is given by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, with central temperature T ∞ c , even if the planet had initially T c &lt; T ∞ c (the general equilibrium profile, in case the energy deposition does not reach the center, is given in Appendix A). However, although planets cool down (and contract) or heat up (and expand) to the same temperatures (and radii), imposed by the stellar irradiation and the heat deposition, we show below that the timescales to reach equilibrium are different. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> we present a schematic plot of the reheating (and therefore re-inflation) of a planet from an initial central temperature T c (assuming the planet has cooled for a few Gyr in the absence of power deposition) to a final equilibrium central temperature T ∞ c &gt; T c , imposed by the energy deposition. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>, the planet heats up from the outside in. This result, which is also evident from numerical calculations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>, is due to both the increase in heat capacity and final temperature with depth and the decrease in deposition with depth, so the heating rate is ∝ τ −(1+α+β/4) . This outside-in heating implies that models, which exploit the entire heat deposited in the convective region to heat up the planet, overestimate the reheating rate (see, e.g., the recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2015</ref>, who suggest a novel test to distinguish between reheating and stalling contraction).</p><p>The time to heat the planet's center, which determines the re-inflation timescale is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">t heat ∼ M mp k B T ∞ c L dep (τ c ) .<label>(38)</label></formula><p>It is instructive to compare this timescale to the cooling timescale of initially hot planets to the same equilibrium central temperature. Due to the decrease of the internal luminosity with central temperature, the cooling timescale is also determined by the final equilibrium temperature T ∞ c , as seen by combining Equations (6) and (10)</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">t cool ∼ M mp k B T ∞ c L int = M mp k B T ∞ c L dep (τ rad ) ,<label>(39)</label></formula><p>where the last equality is due to the condition L int = L dep (τ rad ), which is fulfilled in the final cooling stage (see Section 3 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).

Since the typical cooling time to a radius of 1.3R J is ∼ 1 Gyr (see, e.g., <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>), the long heating timescales of ∼ 30 Gyr (for ǫ = 5%, which</p><p>Optical Depth</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">1 τ b τ rad τ c</formula><p>Temperature <ref type="formula">(</ref> matches inflation to 1.3R J ) imply that planets can only be mildly re-inflated with Ohmic dissipation (up to about 0.2R J ), and that they do not reach their final equilibrium temperature (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013</ref>, for similar results).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this work we analytically studied the effects of additional power sources on the radius of irradiated giant gas planets. The additional heat sources halt the evolutionary cooling and contraction of gas giants, implying a large final equilibrium radius. A slowdown in the evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources which do not extend to the planet's center.</p><p>We generalized our previous work (Paper I), which was confined to localized point sources, to treat sources that extend from the photosphere to the deep interior of the planet. We parametrized such a heat source by the total power it deposits below the photosphere ǫL eq , and by the logarithmic decay rate of the deposited power with optical depth α &gt; 0. Implicitly, we assumed a heating profile L dep (τ ) = ǫL eq τ −α , with L dep (τ ) denoting the accumulated heat deposited below an optical depth τ . Motivated by previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>), we measured the total heat with respect to the incident stellar irradiation L eq and adopted the efficiency parameter ǫ, which was assumed small ǫ &lt; 1.</p><p>We generalized the technique used in Paper I and showed that planetary cooling and contraction stop when the internal luminosity (i.e. cooling rate) drops below the heat deposited in the convective region L int L dep (τ rad ) (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref>. This condition defines a threshold efficiency ǫ τ</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">−(1−α) rad</formula><p>, required to explain the inflation of observed hot Jupiters, where τ rad ≈ 10 5 is the optical depth of the radiative-convective boundary (of ∼ 1 Gyr old planets with an equilibrium temperature of T eq ≈ 2 · 10 3 K) in the absence of heat deposition, and only flat enough heating profiles α &lt; 1 have an impact.</p><p>The method presented in this work reproduces previous numerical results while providing simple intuition and it may be used to study the effects of any power source on the radius and structure of hot Jupiters. Combining the model with observational correlations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Demory &amp; Seager 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Laughlin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Miller &amp; Fortney 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>) may reveal the nature of the additional heat deposition mechanism, if exists, and provide a step toward solving the observed radius anomalies.</p><p>For a quantitative example, we focused on the suggested Ohmic dissipation mechanism, which stems from the interaction of atmospheric winds with the planet's magnetic field (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huang &amp; Cumming 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref>. This mechanism can be described by a power law α ≈ 0.3 in the planet's interior, and a reduction of ≈ 5 · 10 2 in the efficiency, due to the slimness of the wind zone. We therefore found that the threshold efficiency in this case is ≈ 5%, in accordance with previous numerical studies.</p><p>Assuming a constant efficiency of 3%, we estimated inflated radii which are similar to the numerical predictions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref>. However, we challenged the assumption of a constant efficiency, made in previous studies, and examined the correlation between the efficiency and the equilibrium temperature. We found that the efficiency rises with temperature, due to the increase in electrical conductivity, to a maximum of ≈ 0.3 at T eq ≈ 1500 K, and then drops due to the magnetic drag (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Menou 2012)</ref>. As a result, we are able to explain the concentration of radius anomalies around this temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Laughlin et al. 2011</ref>), and to account for the radii of most inflated hot Jupiters, which are in the range ≈ 1500 K − 2500 K and reach ≈ 1.6R J . In addition, we argue that if these planets are indeed inflated by the Ohmic mechanism then they have already reached their final equilibrium state (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Batygin et al. 2011</ref>), and that the energy deposition must have suspended their contraction, and could not have re-inflated them from a smaller radius, since re-inflation timescales are too long (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013)</ref>. Nonetheless, some extremely inflated planets have radii which exceed the predictions of our model. In contrast to most previous studies, we did not introduce any free parameters to model the wind zone, but rather related the wind velocity, and therefore the amount of dissipated heat, to the strength of the magnetic field and to the equilibrium temperature. This procedure, combined with the generalized technique from Paper I, enabled us to estimate the observational correlations expected in an Ohmic heating scenario, and to compare them with observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Laughlin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>). Although our main conclusions are robust, the exact shape of the radius-equilibriumtemperature curve should be studied with more detailed simulations, due to the approximate nature of our assessments.</p><p>This research was partially supported by ISF, ISA and iCore grants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. GENERAL POWER-LAW ENERGY DEPOSITION</head><p>In Section 3 we analyzed the effects of extended heat deposition, parametrized by a power-law heating profile which extends from the surface to the interior of a hot Jupiter. However, in Section 3 we confined the discussion to heating profiles with a cumulative power index α &lt; 1− β, which extend to the planet's center. In this section we relax both constrains, and address more general sources, which may have steeper profiles and a cut-off at some τ cut &lt; τ c .</p><p>We now consider different values of α, with a distinction made by the value of β/(1 − α).</p><p>Case I: α &lt; 1 − β. In this case, as explained in Section 3, a convective region emerges at τ b , given by Equation (16). The convective region continues until τ cut , reaching an energy density of</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">U iso U eq ∼ τ cut τ b β ∼ τ cut ǫ 1/(1−α) β ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>which is derived similarly to Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(8)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>. This secondary convective region is connected to the main interior convective region with a radiative tangent, and L int is found using U iso in the same manner as in Section 2. A schematic temperature profile which clarifies the alternating radiative-convective structure, which is analogous to Paper I and to Section 2.2, is given in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Case II: 1 − β &lt; α &lt; 1. In this case there is no transition to a secondary convective region. Rather, the radiative profile of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> continues up to τ cut , reaching</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">U iso U eq ≈ 1 + ǫτ 1−α cut ≈ ǫτ 1−α cut ,<label>(A2)</label></formula><p>with the last approximation made for the significant heating regime.</p><p>Case III: α &gt; 1. In this case, according to <ref type="bibr">Equa- tion (13)</ref>, the radiative profile is governed by low optical depths and</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">U = U eq + 3 α − 1 ǫL eq 4πR 2 c (A3)</formula><p>for τ ≫ 1.

Therefore, the radiation energy density of the deep isotherm is</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">U iso U eq ≈ 1 + ǫ ≈ 1,<label>(A4)</label></formula><p>regardless of τ cut . We conclude that heating with ǫ ≪ 1 is unable to significantly effect the planetary cooling for α &gt; 1.

(A6)</formula><p>As discussed in Section 3, and seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, an additional requirement is that τ b &lt; τ rad (for Case I, with a similar analog for Case II), with τ rad denoting the radiative-convective transition in the absence of heat deposition. This requirement is satisfied by the condition of Equation (A6) for τ cut &lt; τ rad . On the other hand, if the deposition is intense or deep enough, so that U iso ∼ U c , then the planet reaches equilibrium and cooling stops entirely, as explained in Paper I. A more general analysis, presented schematically in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, shows that for a given heating profile with a cut-off at τ cut &lt; τ c , the planet evolves through 4 distinct stages, with Equation (A5) relevant only to Stage 3:</p><p>Stage 1: isolation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. HIGH ROSSBY NUMBER REGIME</head><p>In Section 4.1 we adopted a low Rossby number approximation Ro ≪ 1, in which the advective term v∇v ∼ v 2 /R in the force balance equation is negligible when compared to the Coriolis acceleration 2Ωv sin φ. Although it is justified for the atmosphere on average, this approximation breaks down close to the equator (φ = 0). In this section we reanalyze the atmospheric wind velocity derivation in the high Rossby number limit Ro ≫ 1, relevant for the equator, and compare the results to the conclusions of Section 4.1.</p><p>In the high Ro case, the force balance Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref>  </p><p>where the advective term replaces the (now negligible) Coriolis term. Equation (B1) indicates that v &lt; c s , and therefore Ro = v/(2ΩR sin φ) &lt; 1, except for the equator (since c s ∼ ΩR; see Section 4.1). This understanding, together with a similar insight from the low Rossby number Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref>, self-consistently justifies our low Ro approximation for the atmosphere on average (excluding the equator). We see again, as in the low Ro case, that due to the strong dependence of the conductivity on the temperature, the magnetized regime corresponds to high equilibrium temperatures. In addition, Equation (32), which demonstrates the dependence of the heating efficiency ǫ ∝ σv 2 on the conductivity (the dominant parameter for an intuitive understanding, due to its strong dependence on the temperature), is clearly valid in the high Ro limit as well, so ǫ ∝ σ for low conductivities, while ǫ ∝ σ −1 for high conductivities (see also Menou 2012). The decay of the velocity and day-night temperature difference with depth is calculated similarly to Section 4.1, with Equation (B1) replacing Equation (26). By combining Equation (B1) with the diffusion Equation (27), we find that for the unmagnetized regime (the magnetized regime is indifferent to Ro)</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">v c s = ∆T T eq 1/2 = Rσ SB T 4 eq c 3 s κ τ 2 .<label>(B2)</label></formula><p>Equation (B2), which is the high Ro version of Equation (28), shows that the velocity and temperature difference decay with depth in the high Ro regime as well. Quantitatively, we find that the decay of the velocity with depth v ∝ κ/τ 2 is the same in both regimes (low and high Ro), as can be immediately understood from Equation <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. We conclude that the high Ro regime, relevant for a narrow strip around the equator, exhibits the same qualitative behavior as the low Ro regime, with some of the quantitative results reproduced as well. Nevertheless, some of the specific power-law scalings with the equilibrium temperature change in this regime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Schematic temperature profile (logarithmic scale) of a hot Jupiter with an energy deposition that extends to its center.
