We sampled the polynomial at the time of each target observation and subtracted it from each target closure phase. We calibrated using a variety of functions; of these, polynomials up to 2nd order in time provided the lowest-scatter calibrated closure phases, with standard deviations of 1.7 ˝ at Ks and 1.9 ˝ at L 1 . We calibrated the squared visibilities similarly, dividing by the calibrator rather than subtracting. We calibrated the mask baselines using the observed power spectra and knowledge of the filter bandpass and plate scale 32 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods 2: LBT Image Reconstruction, Model Fitting, &amp; Parameter Error Estimation</head><p>We fitted models directly to kernel phases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34</ref> linearly independent combinations of closure phases, to search for companions. We modeled the central star as a delta function and each companion as another delta function located a distance s from the star, at position angle P A, and with contrast ∆. We sampled the synthetic complex visibilities at the same baselines and parallactic angles as the data, and performed a grid fit, using a ∆χ 2 to determine our parameter confidence intervals.</p><p>Due to a known degeneracy between companion separation and contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35</ref> brighter companions at smaller separations provide equally good fits as those fainter and farther out. We thus performed fits to individual wavelengths to verify that the positions of b and c agreed across wavelength, then calculated a best fit where the companions coincided at Ks and L 1 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The model grids in this study required " 50, 000 CPU hours to generate, but were computed in a reasonable amount of time using the University of Arizona's El Gato supercomputer.</p><p>We also reconstructed images from the closure phases. To produce cleaner images, we re-calibrated the closure phases toward the best-fit Ks + L 1 model using an optimized calibrator weighting technique applied in previous NRM studies. 8 This calibration is similar to the Locally Optimized Calibration of Images (LOCI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> technique applied in direct imaging. Since this scheme can remove signal and underestimate errors, we applied it only to produce images (see Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 1</ref>), using the polynomial calibration to estimate companion parameters. As a consistency check, we reconstructed images using both the BiSpectrum Maximum Entropy Method (BSMEM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37</ref> and the Monte-Carlo MArkov Chain IMager algorithm (MACIM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38</ref> The companion To create a "typical" error bar for each Keck companion, we estimated the error bar dependence on contrast using the LBT fits. Errors increased with decreasing companion flux, which we parameterized as a square root dependence. For a given Keck companion we thus scaled our LBT errors by the square root of the LBT-to-Keck flux ratio. We inflated the Keck error bars by a factor of 1.3, the ratio of the uncalibrated closure phase scatter in the Keck data (" 4 ˝ ) to that for the LBT data (" 3 ˝ ). We capped the separation upper limits at 3λ{D, where D is Keck's telescope diameter, 10m, since the largest LBT upper limit was at nearly 3λ{D, and companions at those distances are no longer subject to the separation-contrast degeneracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods 4: MagAO Data Reduction and Analysis</head><p>We observed LkCa 15 on November 15 and 22, 2014, as part of the Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPplanetS), a visible-wavelength survey of bright transition discs. GAPplanetS stars are imaged simultaneously in Hα (0.656 µm, ∆λ " 6 nm) and the nearby stellar continuum (0.642 µm, ∆λ " 6 nm) with the 585-actuator Magellan Adaptive Optics systems SDI camera. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42</ref> The continuum channel provides a sensitive, simultaneous probe of the stellar PSF, allowing for effective removal of residual starlight and isolation of Hα emitting sources 12,43 . The observations utilized new single-substrate narrowband Hα and continuum filters, a significant improvement over the previous VisAO SDI filters, which suffered from ghost images. 12</p><p>Seeing during the November 15 observations was better than the site median (0.56 ˘ 0.06 2 ), winds were low (3.6 ˘ 0.9 mph), and humidity was typical of the season (37.0 ˘ 2.8%). Strehl ratio was low (ă 10%), and difficult to measure meaningfully. We characterized image quality using Images were first bias-subtracted, registered, and aligned via cross-correlation. The Hα flat field image showed very little non-uniformity across the field (ă 1%), so a flat field was not applied. We masked CCD dust spots visible in the flat field wherever they affected the image throughput by more than 2%.</p><p>We processed the aligned data using angular differential imaging (ADI 44 ), comparing the Classical ADI reductions We constructed the stellar PSF by median combining images in 0.5 ˝ rotational bins and then median combining again to produce a PSF evenly sampled in rotational space. We subtracted the stellar PSF from the individual images, rotated them to a common on-sky orientation and combined them. Given the small separation between LkCa 15 A and b, the planet moved by only 1.5 FWHM over the course of the observations, resulting in self-subtraction and decreasing the FWHM of the processed planet PSF to " 4 ´ 5 pixels in azimuth.</p><p>KLIP-ADI Reductions KLIP reductions were carried out using a well-tested custom IDL code. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> To optimize reduction parameters, we maximized the signal to noise of injected planets (with the same separation and contrast as LkCa 15 b) inserted after using a negative planet to erase the LkCa 15 b signal. Planets were placed at position angles distant from known artifacts, and east or west of the star to avoid the noisier north / south region of the PSF, corresponding to the wind direction during the observations.</p><p>To limit self-subtraction, the library from which KLIP builds the stellar PSF is limited to images where a planet would have rotated away from its original position. We explored the size of this exclusion region ("rotational mask") systematically through fake planet injection, and found that a 5 ˝ mask ("1 pixel at r " 11 pixels) produced the highest signal-to-noise recoveries of injected planets. Given the stellar FWHM of 0.07 2 , this resulted in azimuthal self-subtraction, with a processed planetary PSF of "2 pixels in azimuth.</p><p>Noise in the KLIP processed images was mostly Gaussian when images were divided into several independently-optimized radial zones, indicating efficient removal of speckles. Dividing We generated error bars by injecting false positive planets with similar separations and contrasts to LkCa 15 b after using a negative planet to eliminate the true signal. Planets were placed at position angles away from the wind direction, and spaced by at least 75% of the measured stellar FWHM. We computed the centroid and peak pixel using a 5 pixel aperture around each planet, and assigned the standard deviations in recovered flux and position as our 1σ photometric and astrometric uncertainties, respectively (see Extended Data <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and Extended Data <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p><p>Signal-to-noise of the Hα Detection To create signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps, we calculated a radial noise profile using the standard deviation of 1-pixel-wide annuli and divided it into the raw images. In the raw maps, LkCa 15 b has SNR " 3 ´ 4. Smoothing by a Gaussian with a 2-pixel FWHM maximized the SNR of injected fake planets, so we applied this smoothing to the final science images, resulting in peak SNRs of 4.4 and 6.8 in the KLIP Hα and ASDI images, respectively. However, directly-imaged exoplanets at small separations suffer from small number statistical effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> The underlying speckle distribution is difficult to probe given the small number of independently sampled noise regions. In an annulus at the distance of LkCa 15 b <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(1.3</ref>  images with a range of contrasts and at positions near LkCa 15 b. We then measured the SNR of each simulated detection to determine the confidence at which we could detect a given contrast.</p><p>As above, we apply a small number statistical correction 48 to the SNR of each recovered planet.</p><p>The simulations suggest that we would have detected an excess with a corrected SNR of 3 (false positive fraction of 10´210´2 ) for a continuum source with contrast greater than 5 ˆ 10´310´3 . Since LkCa 15 A is 1.8 times brighter at Hα than continuum, this corresponds to an Hα-to-continuum-flux ratio lower limit of 2.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limits on LkCa 15 c Hα Contrast</head><p>We established limits on the LkCa 15 c Hα contrast using false planet injections, first using a negative planet to eliminate the LkCa 15 b signal. We injected planets with a range of contrasts at positions sampling the LBT error ellipse for LkCa 15 c. At position angles between -40 ˝ and -52 ˝ , several 2 ´ 2.5 σ peaks near c's location boost the SNRs for recovered planets. Here, we can detect contrasts down to 2 ˆ 10´310´3 with corrected <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> SNRs of 3 (false positive fraction of 2 ˆ 10´210´2 ). Position angles greater than -40 ˝ approach a noisier region of the PSF, leading to decreased sensitivity; here contrasts of 6 ˆ 10´310´3 are required for adjusted signal-to-noise ratios of 3. We cannot reject or confirm accretion onto LkCa 15 c below 6 ˆ 10´310´3 contrast (∆Hα " 5.6) with the current dataset. This improves upon previous spectro-astrometric observations, which yielded a contrast limit of ∆Hα " 3.4 for a position angle near LkCa 15 c. 10</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods 5: Stability Analysis with LkCa 15 d</head><p>We ran a series of orbit integrations to demonstrate that stable solutions exist for b, c, and d at separations within the 1σ semimajor axis error bars (see Extended <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Data Figures 6-7)</ref>. We used the publicly available Swifter package 49 -specifically, the symplectic integrator, SyMBA 50 , which switches to a Burlisch-Stoer algorithm for planetary close approaches. We also ran comparison integrations with the Gauss Radau 15th order integrator and found comparable results, with minimum energy conservation of 1 part in 10 7 over a 10 Myr integration.</p><p>We required all orbits to be nearly co-planar, with a random scatter ă 1 ˝ , and assigned each planet a random eccentricity below 10´410´4 . To assess stability we integrated three different random phase combinations for 10 Myr. We found stable three body solutions out to 1 ´ 2 Myr with semimajor axes of a b " 12.7 AU, a c " 18.6 AU, a d " 24.7 AU. To ensure stability out to 10 Myr with orbits in the 1σ errors requires that all planets be ď 0.5 M J . A wider range of orbits are allowed if d's mass is decreased further. These constraints are in line with previous large numerical studies of equally spaced (in R H,m ), equal-mass planets. 51 Note for planets b and c, there are possible resonant configurations within the predicted period ranges, which would admit somewhat higher masses.     </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>positions agree between the two algorithms, although BSMEM produces more compact emission toward each component. BSMEM has been shown to provide the most faithful image reconstruc- tion of any available algorithms in blind tests. 39 Methods 3: Companion Parameter Error Estimation for Previously-Published Keck Data Orbital fitting required parameter errors for the previously published 8 Keck observations and the LBT observations to be consistently estimated. The published errors for the 2009-2010 compan- ion parameters were generated using the non-linear algorithm MPFIT. 40 While non-linear fitters are often employed for computational expediency, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can easily fall into a local minimum and underestimate parameter errors. The LBT grid χ 2 surfaces show lo- cal minima for both two-and three-companion fits, rendering MPFIT unreliable unless the starting parameters were very close to the global minimum. We compared MPFIT and grid-based parame- ter errors for the LBT data, and found that MPFIT significantly underestimated the errors (Figure 2).</figDesc></figure>

We collected 316 30-second closed-AO-loop images, with a total of 156 minutes of integration time and 48.6 ˝ of sky rotation. We selected the 149 LkCa 15 images with the lowest residual wavefront error (" 50%), equivalent to 74.5 minutes of exposure time. This image subset had 47.6 ˝ of sky rotation, with the rotational space well sampled. The November 22 data were not of sufficient quality to recover LkCa 15 b, due to lower sky rotation (27.0 ˝ ), shorter total integration (91 minutes), and shallower individual exposures (15 seconds). Injected positive planets with the same separation as LkCa 15 b were only recoverable with SNR ą 3 at contrasts ą 5 ˆ 10´210´2 (nearly an order of magnitude brighter than the measured November 15 LkCa 15 b contrast). For this reason, we discuss only the November 15 dataset in the rest of the paper.</figDesc></figure>

LkCa 15 b was detected in the Hα channel via both methods, as shown in Extended Data Figure 2. The planet was not detected in continuum with either method, so continuum images were used as a probe of PSF residuals and scattered light emission from the inner disk. Subtraction of the processed continuum images from the Hα images ("ASDI") left behind only true Hα emission. 12</figDesc></figure>

Photometry and Astrometry We estimated photometry and astrometry by minimizing residuals after injecting a negative planet at the location of LkCa 15 b. The cube of registered and aligned Hα channel images was scaled by the chosen contrast value, multiplied by -1, and injected into the raw images before KLIP processing. Using the full Hα image cube rather than its median combination simulated variability of the PSF between images.</figDesc></figure>

Comparing the LkCa 15 b SNR to the distribution of values in the ASDI SNR map (Extended Data Figure 4), shows that it is a clear outlier. Comparison of the peak pixel in an aperture centered on b to those in the surrounding noise apertures (Extended Data Figures 4-5) further demonstrates b's statistical significance. In addition to the high SNR, low false positive fraction, and the statistics presented in Ex- tended Data Figure 4, the Hα detection is significant because it occurs at the same location as the independent LBT detection. This further reduces the probability of a false positive detection in the MagAO data, since speckles have no preferred location. Fidelity of the LkCa 15 b Detection Neither the existence of LkCa 15 b nor its derived parameters are dependent on our choice to include only the top " 50% of raw images. The planet appears at the same location and with the same approximate brightness when processing all 316 images, as well as only the top 25% of images. An excess with SNR ą 3 appears at LkCa 15 b's location with a wide range of KLIP zone geometries and rotational masks, when any number of KL modes from 2 to 100+ are removed, and whether or not the median radial profile of the PSF is subtracted before processing. Limits on LkCa 15 b SDI Continuum Flux We used simulated planet detections to place an upper limit on LkCa 15 b's continuum flux. We injected planets into the raw continuum channel</figDesc></figure>

Evolution of position angle and separation (inset) for LkCa 15 d. Green and red points indicate Ks and L 1 data, respectively. In both panels, the earliest three points correspond to previously published Keck observations, 8 and the most recent points show best fits to our data. The coloured error bars are derived using the non-linear algorithm MPFIT, which significantly underestimates the parameter errors compared to the more robust grid ∆χ 2 (black error bars; see Methods). The yellow shaded region spans the position angles and separations allowed at 1σ by the multi-epoch observations, which have semi-major axes between 12.6 and 24.7 AU. Solid curves show the best-fit orbit (18.0 AU), and dashed curves show an orbit (24.7 AU) that is stable for a 0.5 M J planet exterior to LkCa 15 b and c. Lower mass planets or resonant configurations permit stable orbits for LkCa 15 d at smaller stellocentric radii. Extended Data Figure 7: Orbital integration results. a) Stable orbits for LkCa 15 b, c, and d over a 10 Myr integration. b) Osculating eccentricity. The planets are each 0.5 M J with initial semi- major axes of 12.7, 18.6, and 24.7 AU, initial eccentricities of order 10´510´5 , and relative inclinations of ă 1 ˝ . After a 10 Myr integration, the eccentricities of c and d have increased to only a few percent.</figDesc></figure>
