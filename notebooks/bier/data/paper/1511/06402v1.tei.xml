			<abstract>
				<p>The DEdicated MONitor of EXotransits (DEMONEX) was a 20 inch robotic and automated telescope to monitor bright stars hosting transiting exoplanets to discover new planets and improve constraints on the properties of known transiting planetary systems. We present results for the mis-aligned hot Jupiter XO-4b containing 7 new transits from the DEMONEX telescope, including 3 full and 4 partial transits. We combine these data with archival light curves and archival radial velocity measurements to derive the host star mass M * = 1.293 +0.030 −0.029 M ⊙ and radius R * = 1.554 +0.042 −0.030 R ⊙ as well as the planet mass M P = 1.615 +0.10 −0.099 M J and radius R P = 1.317 +0.040 −0.029 R J and a refined ephemeris of P = 4.1250687 ± 0.0000024 days and T 0 = 2454758.18978 ± 0.00024 BJD TDB. We include archival Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of XO-4 to infer the stellar spin-planetary orbit alignment λ = −40.0 +8.8 −7.5 degrees. We test the effects of including various detrend parameters, theoretical and empirical mass-radius relations, and Rossiter-McLaughlin models. We infer that detrending against CCD position and time or airmass can improve data quality, but can have significant effects on the inferred values of many parameters-most significantly R P /R * and the observed central transit times T C. In the case of R P /R * we find that the systematic uncertainty due to detrending can be three times that of the quoted statistical uncertainties. The choice of mass-radius relation has little effect on our inferred values of the system parameters. The choice of Rossiter-McLaughlin models can have significant effects of the inferred values of v sin I * and the stellar spin-planet orbit angle λ.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Hot Jupiters are an unique class of extrasolar planets (exoplanets) known for their proximity to their host stars and their large masses. With the discovery of the first hot Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995)</ref>, we now know that understanding the physical nature of hot Jupiters can play a large role in constraining our understanding of a variety of theories regarding planetary formation, disk formation, and planet migration ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Marcy et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nagasawa et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Hot Jupiters provide unique observational opportunities relative to exoplanets of other populations. The small semi-major axis of the orbits of hot Jupiters increase the a priori transit probability, this coupled with a large observational transit signal due to hot Jupiters' large relative radii, and their short periods provide many observational opportunities upon which to identify hot Jupiters and perform follow-up observations. These observational advantages are not unique to photometric observations, but also to radial velocity (RV) measurements where the large masses of hot Jupiters increase the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal as well as to Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) measurements where the RM Electronic address: svillan@astronomy.ohio-state.edu signal is proportional to the transit depth.</p><p>In general, the transits provide a number of geometric ratios to relate the star and planet (i.e., the depth of the transit is related to the planet/star radius ratio), as well as the density of the star. When combined with another constraint on the mass and radius of the primary (e.g., derived from isochrones using the spectroscopic stellar effective temperature and metallicity), and a measurement of the Doppler amplitude from radial velocity observations, it becomes possible to estimate the masses and radii of both the planet and star. Additional measurements allow for the derivation of a large number of physical parameters, not just the planet and stellar masses and radii (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Winn 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Following the discovery of systems containing hot Jupiters, one generally would like to follow-up with observations to better understand the properties of the host star and planet. In general this requires additional photometric and radial velocity observations. Providing stricter constraints on known hot Jupiters provides predictions for future observations, increasing the efficiency of those observations. The purpose of this paper is three-fold in nature. First, to present new data on XO-4b from the DEdicated MONitor of EXotransits (DEMONEX) telescope. Second, we investigate the effects of choices of detrending variables, mass-radius relations, Rossiter-McLaughlin models, and other models or user defined variables on the derived parameters of the system. Third, we improve the parameters of XO-4 and XO-4b by globally fitting all available data in a homogeneous manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">DATA</head><p>The following sections contain summaries of all available data used in our global analysis as well as information regarding the data reduction process used for the new DEMONEX data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">DEMONEX Observations of XO-4</head><p>New observations of XO-4b were made using the DEdicated MONitor of EXotransits (DEMONEX) <ref type="bibr">(Eastman et al. 2010a</ref>). DEMONEX was a low-cost, 0.5 meter, robotic telescope constructed from commerciallyavailable parts operated out of Winer Observatory in Sonoita, Arizona. DEMONEX monitored bright stars hosting known transiting planets over a three year period from <ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2009]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2010]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2011]</ref> in order to provide a homogeneous data set of precise relative photometry for over 40 transiting systems.</p><p>There are 20 nights of data from November 2008 to May 2010 taken during primary transits of XO-4b. All observations were made in the Sloan z band. Due to issues with the mount, 5 nights were lost due to the mount pointing to the incorrect field. In addition, the DEMONEX observing strategy prioritized full transits of other targets over partial transits of XO-4b. Often, that resulted in small observing windows, which we opted to fill with observations near transit in case they happened to be useful rather than sitting idle. Unfortunately, 4 nights only got data out-of-transit and 4 nights only captured the flat bottom of the transit, neither of which ended up providing useful constraints. Thus we were left with an unfortunately low yield of 7/20 (35%) usable nights, but we obtain 3 full transits, 2 ingresses, 2 egresses.</p><p>2.2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McCullough 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McCullough et al. (2008</ref> report the original discovery of the planet XO-4b detected using the XO telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McCullough et al. 2006</ref>). Follow-up BV R observations were made by the XO Extended Team (XOET) as well as follow-up R band photometric observations using the Perkins 1.8-m telescope. Follow-up spectroscopic measurements were made using the Harlan J. Smith 2.7-m telescope and the 11-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. MC08 perform an analysis of the spectra to report the stellar properties of the host star including stellar effective temperature T eff , surface gravity log g * , metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, projected rotational velocity v sin I * , and the RV semi-amplitude K. Combining the stellar parameters with the light curves MC08 report a planet mass of M P = 1.72±0.20 M J , radius of R P = 1.34±0.048 R J , orbital period of P = 4.12502 ± 0.00002 days, and heliocentric Julian date at mid-transit of 2454485.9322 ± 0.0004 for XO-4b.</p><p>We adopt the stellar properties, T eff , log g * , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin I * , from MC08 as Gaussian priors for our global analysis as described in §4.

(2010) (N10) report new Sloan z band photometric and radial velocity observations of XO-4 conducted with the FLWO 1.2 m telescope (photometric) and the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope (RV). Based on these new light curves, N10 report a refined transit ephemeris for XO-4b of P = 4.1250828 ± 0.0000040 days and T c = 2454485.93323 ± 0.00039 BJD TDB .</p><p>N10 also report the first measurements of the RossiterMcLaughlin effect of XO-4b. N10 estimate the skyprojected angle between the stellar spin axis an the planetary orbital axis to be λ = −46.7 +8.1 −6.1 degrees. We compare the N10 results from the publicly-available N10 light curves and radial velocity data against the results we obtain using the same data set outlined in §4.1 to validate our light curve analysis methods and procedures. We also include the publicly-available N10 light curves and radial velocity data in our global analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Todorov et al.

While this routine is intended to convert Geocentric Julian Date from UTC to TDB, it is accurate to 30 ms when using it to convert Barycentric Julian Dates instead ( <ref type="bibr">Eastman et al. 2010b</ref>), which is more than sufficient for our purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">MODELS 3.1. Transits and Radial Velocity</head><p>The models used in this paper to fit the transit and orbital radial velocity data are unchanged from the original <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eastman et al. (2013)</ref> EXOFAST paper. The original EXOFAST paper ignores a number of effects, including RM and transit timing variations (TTVs), that we now include to maintain consistency with work done by the other groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</head><p>We also consider the radial velocity data taken during transit, and as such must consider models for the RM effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rossiter 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">McLaughlin 1924</ref>). The precise model used to model the RM effect can have a significant effect on the inferred parameters, and yet this can vary from system to system <ref type="bibr">Hi- rano et al. 2010)</ref>. A number of RM models exist, and we investigate two separate models here.</p><p>The ambiguity of the proper model of the RM effect that should be used comes from the fact that the RM effect is not, in fact, due to a change in the radial velocity of the star. The radial velocity measurement is made by estimating some measure of the "centers" of known absorption lines and their change in central wavelength relative to laboratory measurements. If the shape of the absorption features changes in such a way as to change the odd moments of the lines, then this can result in a change in the measured line centers, and as a result be attributed to a change in the radial velocity of the star. The precise relation between the change in the line shape and the inferred change in the line center will depend on many intrinsic properties of the star, such as its effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotation rate, as well as the precise algorithm used to estimate the line centers.</p><p>Thus the RM effect manifests as an anomalous radial velocity measurement ∆v RM made during the primary transit, where the anomalous signal is due to a change in the shape of the absorption feature rather than to the motion of the host star. The change in shape is due to the transiting planet preferentially blocking light emitted from the rotating host star. The blocked light, depending on the position of the planet as viewed from the observer, may be red or blue shifted relative to the center of the star due to the rotation of the host star. As this light is blocked it can introduce an asymmetry to the absorption feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gaudi &amp; Winn 2007)</ref>. Because the anomalous signal is dependent on a change in the shape of the absorption feature, the measured ∆v RM will depend heavily on the method used to measure the radial velocity signal, and whether that method is sensitive to changes in the shape of the absorption features.</p><p>The RM anomalous radial velocity shift has a strong dependence on the host star's rotation v sin I * and the orbit of the planet relative to the star's spin axis λ. The RM signal is also dependent on the radius of the planet in stellar radii R p /R * = p, the limb-darkening parameters u 1 and u 2 , and the path the planet takes over star which can be described by the inclination i and orbital distance a or by the impact parameter b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Winn (2010)</ref> gives an approximation for the maximum amplitude of the RM effect as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆v RM ≈ p 2 1 − b 2 (v sin I * )</formula><p>(1) When the effect is observed it is possible to place constraints on the spin-orbit alignment λ, project rotational velocity v sin I * , and the impact parameter b. The transit light curves and previous RV studies provide us with independent constraints on v sin I * and b, and these improve the constraint on λ.</p><p>There are two different RM models we investigate to place the constraint on λ, those based on the moment method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ohta et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ohta et al. , 2009</ref>) (OTS) and those based on the cross-correlation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Queloz et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Winn et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narita et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. 2010)</ref>. There are other models available <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Giménez 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boué et al. 2013</ref>), but we focus on the OTS and cross-correlation methods as the default model in EXOFAST is that based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref> and previous work on XO-4b follows the cross-correlation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Moment Method</head><p>Ohta et al. (2005) describe their derivation of the RM effect as an approximate but accurate analytic formula for the anomaly in the radial velocity curves. Their method approximates the velocity anomaly as the change in the first moment of the absorption line profile and uses only linear stellar limb-darkening. This work is followed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ohta et al. (2009)</ref> where the authors present theoretical predictions for the photometric and spectroscopic signatures of rings around transiting extrasolar planets that now include quadratic limb-darkening and terms for ringed extrasolar planets. These new expressions supersede the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref>.</p><p>To express the radial velocity anomaly we first substitute the variable OTS used to represent stellar intensity to I * to avoid confusion with the stellar inclination sin I * . OTS define the flux of the star as a function of the position of the planet</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F = I(x, z)dxdz I * (x, z)dxdz ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x and z are the position of the center of the planet perpendicular to and parallel to, respectively, the projected rotation axis of the star, and they integrate over the surface brightness of the unocculted stellar disk I * , and I is the surface brightness of the occulted star, such that I = 0 in the region occulted by the planet. OTS then formally express the radial velocity anomaly as the first moment of the relative flux</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∆v RM = −v sin I * xI(x, z)dxdz I * (x, z)dxdz ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where they assume rigid rotation in the star, i.e. no differential rotation such that the projected velocity is constant along lines of constant x.</p><p>When we use these expressions we ignore the potential effects of planetary rings. Under this assumption, the expression can be reduced the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∆v RM = x p v sin I * F (4)</formula><p>where x p is the x component of the planet's position in units of stellar radii and F is the relative flux from Equation (2). The details of these expressions are included in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ohta et al. (2009)</ref>, including detailed expressions for integrating the flux in Equation (2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Cross-Correlation Method</head><p>An alternative method to measure the RM effect is to compare the anomalous radial velocity by crosscorrelation with a stellar template spectrum. This method was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Queloz et al. (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Winn et al. (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Narita et al. (2009)</ref>, among others, and is described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref>. This method involves creating an N ×N element star, where N 2 ∼ 10 6 , and each element contains a solar spectrum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref> create a synthetic spectrum of the star by applying a stellar rotation kernel to redshift each element, multiply the spectral lines by the instrumental profile of their spectrograph, and integrate all of the elements minus those obscured by the transit to create simulated in-transit spectra. These simulated spectra are then fed through their analysis routine that fit the lines and adjust the shape of the model to best fit the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref> cover in detail the choice of absorption line profile (Gaussian, Voigt, etc.), and eventually settle on a form inspired by their Gaussian approximation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆v RM = −F v p (p − qv 2 p ) (5)</formula><p>Here F is the flux ratio and uses the same expression as that of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>, and v p can be expressed as the position of the planet</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v p (x, y) = v(x ′ , y ′ )x ′ sin I * dx ′ dy ′ dx ′ dy ′ .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The parameters p and q are each functions of thermal broadening, micro-turbulent broadening, and the stellar rotation width that describe the shape of the line. The parameters p and q are empirically fit for each individual planetary system the method is applied to. For rigidly rotating stars v(x, y) sin I * is a constant along lines of constant x and the expression reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v p (x, y) = xv sin I * ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and reproduces the OTS</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆v RM = −v sin I * x ′ I(x ′ , z ′ )dx ′ dz ′ I * (x ′ , z ′ )dx ′ dz ′ (8)</formula><p>result as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref>. As a result, to first order, for which p = 1 and q = 0, Equation (5) reduces to Equation (4) and the two methods are identical.</p><p>Because p and q depend on precisely how the algorithm used to estimate the radial velocity measures the shape of the absorption profiles and the line spread function of the spectrograph, it is possible to confuse a change in line shape as instrumental and not due to the RM effect. If ignored, this can lead to a misinterpretation of the RM effect, and as such this method must be applied to each system as outlined above to distinguish between the two effects. There are cases when the moment method and cross-correlation methods produce the same results ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Winn et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Johnson et al. 2008</ref>); however, for many cases the two methods result in statistically different inferences for the derived parameters of v sin I * and λ. For reference, in the case of XO-4b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Narita et al. (2010)</ref> derive and report p = 1.6159 and q = 0.83778.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>To analyze the XO-4b data we use a custom version of the publicly available EXOFAST suite of IDL programs described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eastman et al. (2013)</ref>. This is a continuation of the same code used to fit the KELT discoveries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Siverd et al. 2012</ref>), and includes the ability to simultaneously fit multiple transit light curves, both on the same telescope from different nights and from different telescopes, as well as the ability to include multiple radial velocity data sets. Additional modifications were made by us to update the default RM models, include alternative RM models, and to change how the estimated errors are scaled on the RM data.</p><p>We adopt Gaussian priors from MC08 on the stellar parameters T eff , log g * , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin I * , and use the reported values of p = 1.6159 and q = 0.83778 from N10 when using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref> based RM models. We do ignore secondary eclipse data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Todorov et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Narita Data vs Narita 2010</head><p>As a confirmation of our light curve analysis we make many of the same assumptions used in the N10 paper and compare the output from EXOFAST using the N10 data to the published results of the N10 paper. It should be noted that N10 include the same Gaussian priors we adopt, and additionally include a Gaussian prior on the period and T 0 from MC08. N10 also fix the limb-darkening parameter u 1 and treat the second limb-darkening parameter u 2 as a free parameter. In EXOFAST both u 1 and u 2 are calculated from log g * , T eff , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and the observed band-pass from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Claret &amp; Bloemen (2011)</ref>. During this exercise we do not create a new free parameter for u 2 , nor do we fix u 1 , but we do include the Gaussian priors on period and T 0 . Thus our results are not precisely comparable, although we expect any differences to be relatively minor. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> contains the same parameters published in N10 (Narita χ 2 ) along with those produced by EXOFAST (EXOFAST MCMC ). The values are consistent within the errors for all parameters. It should be noted that N10 use the minima in χ 2 and ∆χ 2 = 1 to quote their best value and errors, where we typically quote the median values of the parameters and the 68% confidence intervals from the MCMC chains. In order to more precisely compare our results to those of N10, we also fit a multidimensional hyperboloid to the output MCMC chains in order to infer the values of the parameters with the minimum χ 2 and the values where ∆χ 2 = 1 (EXOFAST χ 2 ).</p><p>As we did not create a new free parameter for u 2 , the constraint on the second limb-darkening parameter is calculated from the parameters log g * , T eff , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and the band. Thus the uncertainty on u 2 is simply a reflection on the covariance of u 2 with these parameters. We generally find values and uncertainties that are in good agreement with those of N10, verifying that the methods used in N10 are comparable to those used in EXO-FAST. The final column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the differences in the two minimum χ 2 values divided by the uncertainties in quadrature for reference. The differences between methods are less than 1 σ and any differences may be attributable to our slightly different methods of estimating the values for the minimum χ 2 and ∆χ 2 = 1.</p></div>

We then select the the comparison star that gives the lowest out-of-transit (pre-ingress and post-egress) root-mean-square (RMS) for XO-4, and we add additional comparison stars only if their inclusion reduces the out-of-transit RMS of the normalized light curve from XO-4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Detrend Parameters</head><p>EXOFAST can take trends in the photometric data and remove them to improve the quality of data. We investigate which, if any, detrend parameters in the DE-MONEX data are significantly affecting the data quality and thus should be removed. We consider the the position on the star on the CCD, x and y, the time (BJD TDB ), and airmass sec z as these are typical detrend parameters used in other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Collins et al. 2014</ref>). We take the case of no detrending and compare the results when the light curves were detrended against a single parameter. We then began adding in additional detrend parameters to detrend simultaneously. We no-2 http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/ tice that there are significant trends in all four detrend parameters when fitted individually. Once all of the parameters are included, the derived parameters converge to within 1 σ of values previously published in the literature as well as the values derived when we use only the N10 data in EXOFAST from §4.1. This suggests that including all available detrend parameters improves our analysis, at the expense of more computational time and creating the potential of a new local minima in the χ 2 space that we search through. As airmass and time are correlated we only include time to reduce the parameter space that the EXOFAST MCMC chains must search through and to speed up the computational time. Thus our final DEMONEX data set is detrended against x, y, and BJD TDB .</p><p>The parameter most sensitive to the quality of data and selection of detrend parameters is R P /R * , while others (such as v sin I * ) are weakly dependent on the detrend parameters. However many of the derived parameters are correlated with R P /R * , parameters such as the spin-orbit alignment λ that depend on both R P /R * and v sin I * , are still subject to the choice of included detrend parameters. Again we notice that most parameters converge to previous estimates as more detrend parameters are included as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. It it worth noting that for the parameter R P /R * the change in the inferred value for R P /R * can vary by over 3 σ depending on the choice of, and number of, detrend parameters. Thus the systematic uncertainty due to the selection of detrend parameters is far greater than the statistical uncertainty quoted and derived from the data itself.</p><p>Additionally we look at the effects of detrending on the inferred TTVs by enabling the time of the central transit to be a free parameter, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. We should note that not all of the possible combinations of detrend variables were able to be selected as the increased freedom of floating central transit times and the detrending parameters resulted in many chains failing to meet the convergence criteria. To counteract this a Gaussian prior was placed on the period to allow the chains to converge. This prior is only used when detrending DE-MONEX data only. In some cases the inferred variations in the derived O-C is consistent within the uncertainty regardless of which detrending variable is selected. There are still cases where the O-C varies at the few σ level,  indicating that the choice of detrend variable once again matters and the presence of systematic uncertainties that exist in addition to the quoted statistical uncertainties. It is still the case that even when using detrending parameters, multiple nights have an O-C that imply a significant TTV. It is not clear to the authors which detrend parameters, or combinations of detrend parameters, are the "correct" parameters to detrend against. Including detrend parameters has significant implications on the derived parameters, especially R P /R * , but we do not yet have an objective way to determine which set of parameters is "correct". We consider some metric involving χ 2 minimization, but note that this assumes uncorrelated data which we know not to be the case. We understand that our data contain systematics, and detrending is one such effort to reduce the effects of these systematics. We also note that including all of the available parameters produces inferred values consistent with previous measurements, but this can vary at the 3 σ level to the inferred value when detrend parameters are not used. We therefore conclude that detrended data inherently contain additional systematic uncertainties, typically not quoted, and detrending must be applied carefully in order to avoid biasing the inferred parameters. Additionally readers should be cautious when trusting the inferred values of these parameters in this and other papers. We have made efforts to quantify and reduce these systematic uncertainties, but do not yet have an ideal way in which to eliminate them altogether. Our study of these effects is however a step in the right direction.</p></div>

The two values derived for the spin-orbit alignment, λ Hirano = −40.0 +8.8 −7.5 and λ OTS = −20.6 +9.0 −8.0 , disagree at the 1σ level. There is evidence that the OTS method can systematically miscalculate the amplitude of the anomalous radial velocity measurement ∆v RM , but that the method still correctly recovers λ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benomar et al. 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gaudi &amp; Winn (2007)</ref> have shown that there is strong degeneracy between v sin I * and λ for systems with central transits, i.e. low impact parameters.

We note that, although the two models agree at nearly 1σ, the implications are very different. In one case, one could infer that the system is almost consistent with being aligned (λ OTS is consistent with zero at ∼ 2σ), whereas this is much less likely for the other model.

Nights with zero transit timing variations will lie on the dashed line. Even with the exception of UT 2007-11-03 (Epoch -74), there are still a few significant outliers and nights consistent with the presence of transit timing variation. The ∼ 2000 s outlier is the result of poor photometry and the fitting procedure and is omitted in our analysis.

corrections. To perform the fringe corrections a master 
fringe image is created by taking the median of the near-
est 100 images separated by a minimum time step, where 
the stars are masked out in each image. The background 
and amplitude of the master fringe image are fit and then 
subtracted off of each science image.
