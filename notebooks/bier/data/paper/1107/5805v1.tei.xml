			<abstract>
				<p>I describe ongoing work on development of Bayesian methods for exploring periodically varying phenomena in astronomy, addressing two classes of sources: pulsars, and extrasolar planets (exoplanets). For pulsars, the methods aim to detect and measure periodically varying signals in data consisting of pho-ton arrival times, modeled as non-homogeneous Poisson point processes. For exoplanets, the methods address detection and estimation of planetary orbits using observations of the reflex motion &quot;wobble&quot; of a host star, including adaptive scheduling of observations to optimize inferences.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Pulsating Sky</head><p>3 likelihood functions and posterior densities. In § 3 I describe detection and measurement of pulsars using data that report precise arrival times of individual light quanta (photons), including Bayesian approaches to arrival time series analysis using parametric and semiparametric inhomogeneous Poisson point process models. In § 4 I turn to exoplanets, where the most productive detection methods as of this writing find planets that are too dim to see directly by looking for the reflex motion "wobble" of their host stars. Here the data are irregularly sampled time series with additive noise, with very accurate but highly nonlinear parametric models for the underlying orbital motion. I will briefly describe some key inference problems (e.g., planet detection and orbit fitting), but I will focus on application of Bayesian experimental design to the problem of adaptive scheduling of the costly observations of these systems. A running theme is devising Bayesian counterparts to well-known frequentist methods, and then using the Bayesian framework to add new capability not so readily achieved with conventional approaches. A final section offers some closing perspectives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PERIODOGRAMS AND MULTIMODALITY</head><p>Suppose we have data consisting of samples of a time-dependent signal, f (t), corrupted by additve noise; suppose the sample times, ti (i = 1 to N ) are uniformly spaced in time, with spacing δt and total duration T = tN − t1. The measured data, di, are related to the signal by,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">di = f (ti) + ǫi,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ǫi denotes the unknown noise contribution to sample i. If we suspect the signal is periodic with period τ and frequency f = 1/τ , a standard statistical tool for assessing periodic hypotheses is the Schuster periodogram (Schuster 1898), a continuous function of the unknown angular frequency of the signal, ω = 2πf :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P(ω) = 1 N C 2 (ω) + S 2 (ω) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where C and S are projections of the data onto cosine and sine functions;</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C(ω) = i di cos(ωti), S(ω) = i di sin(ωti).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Using trigonometric identities one can show that</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P(ω) = 1 N i die iωt i 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Thus the periodogram is the squared magnitude of a quantity like the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but considered as a continuous function of frequency; accordingly, the periodogram ordinate is often called the power at frequency ω. The periodogram is a periodic function of ω, with period 2π/δt, and it is reflectionsymmetric about the midpoint of each such frequency interval; these symmetries reflect the aliasing of signals with periods smaller than twice the interval between samples (i.e., periods for which the data are sampled below the Nyquist rate). We will assume the angular frequencies of interest have ω ∈ (0, π/δt); equivalently, f ∈ (0, 1/2δt). Suppose the available information justifies assigning independent standard normal probability densities for the ǫi. Then the periodogram has several simple and useful properties. Under the null hypothesis (H0) of a constant signal, f (t) = 0, the Fourier frequencies, fj = j/T (j = 1 to N/2), play a special role. The NF = N/2 values {P(2πfj )} are statistically independent; the probability distribution for each value of 2P(2πfj ) is χ 2 2 (i.e., the periodogram values themselves have exponential distributions). The independence implies that the continuous function P(ω) may be expected to have significant structure on angular frequency scales ∼ 2π/T (or 1/T in f ), the Fourier spacing.</p><p>The best-known use of periodograms in astronomy is for nonparametric periodic signal detection via a significance test that attempts to reject the null. The simplest procedure examines P(ωj) at the Fourier frequencies to find the highest power. From the χ 2 2 null distribution a p-value may be calculated, say, p1. The overall pvalue, p, must account for examination of N/2 independent periodogram ordinates; a Bonferroni correction leads to p ≈ NF p1 (for small p1). When p is small (say, p &lt; 0.01), one claims there is significant evidence for a periodic signal; astronomers refer to p as the significance level associated with the claimed detection.</p><p>In practice, when a periodic signal is present, its frequency will not correspond to a Fourier frequency, reducing power (in the Neyman-Pearson sense). Thus one oversamples by a factor M , examining the periodogram at M × NF frequencies with a sub-Fourier frequency spacing, δω = 1/(M T ) with M typically a small integer. The multiple testing correction is now more complicated because the periodogram ordinates are no longer independent random variables; an appropriate factor may be found via Monte Carlo simulation, though simple rules-of-thumb are often used.</p><p>There is a complementary parametric view of the periodogram, arising from time-domain harmonic modeling of the signal. As a simple periodic model for the signal, consider a sinusoid of unknown frequency, phase φ, and amplitude, A: f (t) = A cos(ωt−φ). Least squares (LS) fitting of this single harmonic to the data examines the sum of squared residuals,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Q(ω, A, φ) = i [di − A cos(ωti − φ)] 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The log-likelihood function, using the standard normal noise model, is L(ω, A, φ) = − 1 2 Q(ω, A, φ), so the same sum plays a key role in maximum likelihood (ML) fitting. For a given candidate frequency, we can analytically calculate the conditional (on ω) LS estimates of the amplitude and phase, ˆ A(ω) andˆφandˆ andˆφ(ω). To estimate the frequency, we can examine the profile statistic, Qp(ω) = Q(ω, ˆ A(ω), ˆ φ(ω)); the bestfit frequency minimizes this (i.e., maximizes the profile likelihood). The profile statistic is closely connected to the periodogram; one can show</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Qp(ω) = Const. − P(ω),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the constant is a function of the data but not the parameters. A corollary of this intimate connection between parametric harmonic analysis and periodograms is that the strong variability of the (nonparametric) periodogram implies strong multimodality of the harmonic model likelihood function (and hence of the posterior distribution in Bayesian harmonic analysis), on frequency scales ∼ 1/T .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p>In astronomy it is frequently the case that phenomena are not sampled uniformly, if only due to the constraint of night-sky observation and the vagaries of telescope scheduling and weather. The periodogram/least squares connection provided the key to generalizing periodogram-based nonparametric periodic signal detection to nonuniformly sampled data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lomb (1976)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Scargle (1982)</ref> took the connection as a defining property of the periodogram, leading to a natural generalization for nonuniform data called the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP). Though developed for analysis of astronomical data, the LSP is now a widely used tool in time series analysis across many disciplines.</p><p>Only recently was the Bayesian counterpart to this worked out, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jaynes (1987) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bretthorst (1988)</ref>. Instead of maximizing a likelihood function over amplitude and phase, they "do the Bayesian thing" and marginalize over these parameters. The logarithm of the marginal density for the frequency is then proportional to the periodogram; for irregularly sampled data, there is a similar connection to the LSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bretthorst 2001)</ref>. But this was more than a rediscovery of earlier results in new clothing. From within a Bayesian framework, the calculations for converting periodogram values into probability statements about the signal differ starkly from their frequentist spectral analysis counterparts.</p><p>The most stark difference appears, not in parameter estimation, but in signal detection via model comparison. The conditional odds for a periodic signal being present at an a priori known frequency is approximately an exponential of the periodogram. But the frequency is never known precisely a priori. For detecting new periodic sources, one must perform a "blind search" over a large frequency range. Even for recovering a known signal in new data, the (predictive) frequency uncertainty, based on earlier measurements, is typically considerable. In Bayesian calculations, frequency uncertainty is accounted for by calculating marginal rather than maximum likelihoods, with the averaging over frequency in the marginalization integral being the counterpart to Bonferroni correction. There is no special role for Fourier frequencies in this calculation, either in location or in number; in fact, one wants to evaluate the periodogram at as many frequencies as needed to accurately calculate the integral under the continuous periodgram (exponentiated). Oversampling, to get an accurate integral, adds no new complication to the calculation.</p><p>A further difference comes from quantifying evidence for a signal with the probability for a periodic hypothesis, instead of a p-value quantifying compatibility with the null. Very commonly, astronomers observe populations of sources; detection and measurement of individual sources is merely a stepping stone toward characterization of the population as a whole. Signal probabilities (or marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors) facilitate population modeling via multilevel (hieararchical) models. Roughly speaking, marginal likelihoods provide a weighting that allows one to account for detection uncertainty in population inferences; e.g., when inferring the number of dim sources, a large number of marginal detections may provide strong evidence for a modest number of sources, even though one may not be able to specify precisely which of the candidate sources are actual sources. In contrast, populationlevel inference is awkward and challenging when p-values are used to quantify the evidence for a signal. For example, one might attempt to use false-discovery rate control to find a threshold p-value corresponding to a desired limit on the number of false claimed detections within a population (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hopkins et al. 2002</ref> for an astronomical example). But the (unknown) actual false detections will be preferentially clustered at low signal levels, corrupting population-level inferences of the distribution of signal amplitudes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. J. Loredo</head><p>A valid criticism of the Bayesian approach is the need to employ an explicit signal model, here a single sinusoid, raising concern about behavior for signals not resembling the model. A frequentist nonparametric "omnibus" test that focuses on rejection of a null appears more robust. But recent theoretical insights into the capabilities of frequentist hypothesis tests ameliorate this criticism.</p><p>Imagine an omnibus goodness-of-fit test that aims to detect periodicity by testing for arbitrary (periodic) departures from a constant signal. Set the test size α (the maximum p-value we will accept as indicating the actual signal is not constant) to be small, α ≪ 1, corresponding to a small expected "false alarm" rate for a Neyman-Pearson test (it is worth emphasizing that the observed p-value itself is not a false alarm rate, despite increasingly frequent use of such terminology in the astronomy literature). We would like the test power β (the long-run rate of rejection of the null when a non-constant signal is present) to be as near unity as possible for arbitrary non-constant signals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Janssen (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Lehman and Romano (2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">LR05)</ref> examine the power of such omnibus tests over all local alternatives (i.e., alternatives, described in terms of a basis, in a region of hypothesis space about the null shrinking in size like 1/ √ N for data sets of size N ). They show that β ≈ α for all alternatives except for those along a finite number of directions in hypothesis space (independent of N ). As a result, "A proper choice of test must be based on some knowledge of the possible set of alternatives for a given experiment" (LR05). Freedman (2009) proves a complimentary theorem showing that, for any choice of test, there are some remote alternatives (i.e., not in a shrinking neighborhood of the null) for which β ≈ 0. As a consequence of these and related results, he concluded, "Diagnostics cannot have much power against general alternatives."</p><p>These results are changing practice in construction of frequentist tests. Instead of devising clever statistics that embody an intuitively appealing "generic" measure of non-uniformity, statisticians are turning to the practice of specifying an explicit family of alternatives (e.g., via a specific choice of basis), and deriving tests that concentrate power within the chosen family (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bickel et al. 2006</ref>). An example in astronomy is the work of Bickel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kleijn and Rice (2008)</ref> on pulsar detection, using a Fourier basis. These developments indicate that, one way or another, one had better consider specific alternatives to the null. In this respect, parametric Bayesian model comparison (with a prior over a broad parametric family) and nonparametric frequentist testing do not seem very far apart. With this perspective, we can see the links between the periodogram and both frequentist and Bayesian harmonic analysis as exposing the choice of alternatives implicit in periodogram-based periodic signal detection.</p><p>Summarizing, some key points from this brief look at periodograms, which will guide subsequent developments, are: (1) We expect the likelihood (and thus the posterior) will be highly multimodal in the frequency dimension. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> The scale of variability of the likelihood in the frequency dimension will be ∼ 1/T . For problems with long-duration datasets and significant prior frequency uncertainty, exploring the frequency dimension will be challenging. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> A key difference between Bayesian and frequentist approaches arises from how frequency uncertainty (and other parameter uncertainty) is handled, e.g., whether one maximizes and then corrects for multiple tests, or marginalizes, letting probability averaging implicitly account for the parameter space size. In 1967, Jocelyn Bell, a graduate student of the radio astronomer Anthony Hewish, was monitoring radio observations of the sky that combined good sensitivity with fast (sub-second) time resolution. She made a startling discovery: a celestial source was emitting a strong periodic signal with a period of less than a second. It is hard to appreciate today just how shocking this discovery was. Theoretical astrophysicist Philip Morrison recalled the early reaction to the news in an interview for the American Institute of Physics: 1 I remember myself meeting at the airport a friend who just returned from Great Britain, an astronomer. And he said, "Have you heard the latest? . . . They've got something that pulses every second-a stellar signal that pulses every second." I said, "Oh, that couldn't be true!" "Yes," he said, "it's absolutely true. They announced it recently. They've studied it for about five or six months. It's extraordinary." . . . <ref type="bibr">[T]</ref>hey sat on these results for several months, because the whole thing was so extraordinary and so unexpected, that they didn't want to release it until they had a chance to confirm it. The reason of course is quite simple. We think of the stars quite sensibly as being-well we say the fixed stars-as being eternal, long-lived, everlasting. And even though we know that's not 100% true-that the star sometimes explodes a little bit, making a nova, or explodes disruptively flinging itself apart entirely, making a supernova-still those are not really fast events from a human time scale. If they take a few seconds or a day, that would be remarkable for a star. You don't see much happening on the stars in a second. . . .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Pulsating Sky</head><p>[W]e knew something remarkable was going on and people gave it a name, pulsar. . . of course the whole astronomical community was galvanized in looking at it.</p><p>We now understand pulsars to be rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars, dense remnants of the cores of massive stars, with masses somewhat larger than that of the Sun, but occupying a nearly spherical volume only ∼ 10 km in radius, and hence with a density similar to that of an atomic nucleus. The pulsations are due to radiative processes near the star that get their energy from the whirling magnetic field, which acts like a generator, accelerating charged particles to high energies. The particles radiate in beams rotating with the star; the observed pulsars are those whose beams sweep across the line of sight to Earth, in the manner of a lighthouse. The fastest pulsars rotate about 700 times a second; more typical pulsars have periods of order a second. If we could hear the variation in intensity of the light they emit, the slower ones would sound like a ticking clock (of extraordinary accuracy); the faster ones would hum and whine.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. J. Loredo</head><p>To date about two thousand pulsars have been discovered; ongoing surveys continue to add to the number. The majority of pulsars pulse in radio waves. But a number of them also pulse in higher energy radiation: visible light, X rays, and gamma rays. Recently, a small number of radio-quiet pulsars have been found that pulse only in high energy radiation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows folded light curves-radiation intensity vs. time, with time measured in fractions of the period-for several pulsars observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. There are clear differences in the light curves for a particular pulsar across energy ranges, indicating that different physical processes, probably in spatially distinct regions, produce the various types of emission. Astronomers are trying to detect and measure as many pulsars as possible, across the electromagnetic spectrum, to characterize pulsar emission as a population phenomenon, pooling information from individual sources to unravel the physics and geometry of pulsar emission and how it may relate to the manner of stellar death and the magnetic and material environments of stars. X rays and gamma rays are energetic, with thousands to billions of times more energy per photon (light quantum) than visible light. Even when a source is very luminous at high energies (i.e., emitting a large amount of energy per unit time), the number flux (number per unit time and area) of X rays and gamma rays at Earth may be low. Astronomers use instruments that can detect and measure individual photons. The resulting time series data are usually arrival time series, sequences of precisely measured arrival times for detected photons, ti (i = 1 to N ); photon energy and direction may also be measured as "marks" on this point process. For gamma-ray emission, the flux is so small that the event rate is well below one event per period. But precise timing measurements spanning long time periods-hours to days-can gather enough events to unambiguously identify pulsar signals, particularly when multiple sets of observations spanning weeks or months (with large gaps) are jointly analyzed.</p><p>In June 2008, NASA launched a new large space-based telescope tasked with surveying the sky in gamma rays: the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. One of Fermi's key scientific goals is to undertake a census of gamma-ray pulsars (see Abdo</p><p>The Pulsating Sky 9 et al. 2010 for the first Fermi pulsar catalog). This has renewed interest in methods for analyzing arrival time series data. Here I will survey Bayesian work in this area dating from the early 1990s that appears little-known outside of astronomy, and then describe new directions for research motivated by Fermi observations.</p><p>Since the photons originate from microscopic quantum mechanical processes at different places in space, a Poisson point process (possibly non-homogeneous) can very accurately model the data. This is the foundation for both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to periodic signal detection in these data. For bright X-ray sources, with many events detected per candidate period, events may be binned in time, and standard periodogram techniques may then be applied to the uniformlyspaced binned counts (the p-value calculation is adjusted to account for the "root-n" standard deviation of the counts). We focus here instead on the low-flux case, where the data are too sparse for binning to be useful, so they must be considered as a point process. This is the case for dim X-ray sources and all gamma-ray sources.</p><p>For most periodic signal detection problems with arrival time data , astronomers use frequentist methods inspired by the periodogram approach in the additive noise setting described in § 2: one attempts to reject the null model of constant rate by using a frequency-dependent test statistic, calculating p-values, and correcting for multiplicity. A variety of statistics have been advocated, but three dominate in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lewis 1994</ref> and Orford 2000 provide good overviews of the most-used methods). All of them start by folding the data modulo a trial period to produce a phase, φi, for each event in the interval <ref type="bibr">[0, 2π]</ref>; the statistics aim to measure departure from uniformity over phase (i.e., they are statistics for detecting nonuniformity of directional data on the circle).</p><p>First is the Rayleigh statistic, R(ω), defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">R 2 = 1 N   N i=1 sin φi 2 + N i=1 cos φi 2   .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The quantity 2R 2 (ω) is called the Rayleigh power. It is the point process analog to the Schuster periodogram of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref>, and under the null, asymptotically 2R 2 ∼ χ 2 2 (so R 2 follows an exponential distribution). In practice, the Rayleigh statistic performs well for detecting signals that have smooth light curves with a single peak per period. As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> reveals, this is not typically the case for high energy emission from pulsars, so statistics are sought that have greater power for more complicated shapes.</p><p>Taking a cue from the resemblence of R(ω) to a Fourier magnitude, the Z 2 m statistic sums power from m harmonics (counting the fundamental as m = 1) of the Rayleigh power:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Z 2 m = 2 m k=1 R 2 (kω).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Under the null, asymptotically Z 2 m ∼ χ 2 2m . The number of harmonics, m, is usually set to a small integer value a priori (m = 2 is popular), though it is also possible to allow m to adapt to the data.</p><p>The third commonly-used method is χ 2 epoch folding (χ 2 -EF). For every trial frequency, the folded phases are binned into M equal-width phase bins, and Pearson's χ 2 is used to test consistency with the null hypothesis of a constant phase distribution. The number of bins is chosen a priori. The counts in each bin (for a chosen ω) will depend on the origin of time; moving the origin will change the folded phases and shift events between phase bins. To account for this, the χ 2 statistic may be averaged over phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Collura et al. 1987)</ref>. This alters its distribution under the null; Collura et al. explore it via Monte Carlo simulation.</p><p>The Z 2 m and χ 2 -EF statistics can be more sensitive to structured light curves than the Rayleigh statistic, but with additional complexity in the form of intractable distributions or the need to fix structure parameters (number of harmonics or bins) a priori.</p><p>All of these statistics are simple to compute, and there are good reasons to seek simplicity. For a typical detectable X-ray pulsar, it may take observations of duration T ∼ 10 4 to 10 5 s to gather a few thousand photons; for a detectable gammaray pulsar, it may take a week or more of integrated exposure time, so T ∼ 10 6 s. The Fourier spacing for such data ranges from µHz to ∼ 0.1 mHz. For a targeted searchattempting to detect emission from a previously detected pulsar (e.g., detected in radio waves)-the frequency uncertainty is typically hundreds to thousands times greater than this Fourier spacing. For a blind search-attempting to discover a new pulsar-the number of frequencies to search is orders of magnitude larger. Pulsars are observed with fundamental frequencies up to ≈ 700 Hz (centrifugal forces would destroy a neutron star rotating more rapidly than about a kilohertz). The nonsinusoidal shapes of pulsar light curves imply there may be significant power in harmonics of the rotation frequency, at frequencies up to fmax ≈ 3000 Hz. The number of frequencies that must be examined is then ∼ fmaxT , which can be in the tens of millions for X-ray pulsars, or the billions for gamma-ray pulsars.</p><p>In fact, the computational burden is significantly worse. The energy emitted by pulsars is drawn from the reservoir of rotational energy in the spinning neutron star. Thus, by conservation of energy, an isolated pulsar must be spinning down (a pulsar in a binary system may instead spin up, if it is close enough to its companion star to accrete mass carrying angular momentum). The pulsar frequency thus changes in time; a linear change, parameterized in terms of the frequency derivative ˙ f , describes most pulsars well, though a few have higher derivatives that are measurable. A pulsar search must search over ˙ f values as well as frequency values. The number of ˙ f values to examine is determined by requiring that the frequency drift across the data set, ˙ f T , be smaller than the Fourier frequency spacing, giving a number of ˙ f trials of T 2 ˙ fmax, with ˙ fmax ≈ 10 −10 Hz s −1 for known pulsars. For a targeted search with the shortest X-ray data sets, using a single ˙ f value (estimated from previous observations) may suffice. For blind searching for gamma-ray pulsars, one may have to consider ∼ 10 3 values of ˙ f . Clever use of Fourier techniques, including tapered transforms, can reduce the burden significantly (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atwood et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Meinshausen et al. 2009</ref>). Even so, the number of effectively independent hypotheses in (f, ˙ f ) space will be thousands for targeted search, and many millions to a billion for blind search. This limits the complexity of detection statistics one may consider, and requires that sampling distributions be estimated accurately far in their tails.</p><p>We now consider Bayesian alternatives to the traditional tests, built using timedomain models for a non-homogeneous Poisson point process with time-dependent intensity (expected event rate per unit time) r(t). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For periodic models, the parameters for r(t) will include an amplitude, A; the angular frequency, ω; a phase (corresponding to defining an origin of time), φ; and one or more shape parameters, S, that parameterize the light curve shape. The likelihood function is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L(A, ω, φ, S) = exp − T dt r(t) N i=1 r(ti),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>written here with the parameter dependence implicit in r(t) = r(t; A, ω, φ, S). We will be comparing models for the signal, including a constant "null" model that will have only an amplitude parameter. Since all models share an amplitude parameter, it is helpful to define it in a way so that a common prior may be assigned to A across all models. We write the periodic model rate as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r(t) = Aρ(ωt − φ),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where ρ(θ) is a periodic function with period 2π, and A is defined to be the average rate,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A ≡ 1 P P dt r(t).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>(For a constant model, r(t) = A.) This implies a normalization constraint on ρ(θ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">2π 0 dθ ρ(θ) = 2π,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>or, equivalently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">τ dt ρ(ωt + φ) = 1.<label>(13)</label></formula><p>That is, ρ(θ) is normalized as if ρ(θ)/2π were a probability density in phase, or ρ(ωt+φ) were a probability density in time (over one period).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. J. Loredo</head><p>To go forward, we now must specify models for ρ(θ), bearing in mind the computational burden of (f, ˙ f ) searching. In particular, since we will need to integrate the likelihood function over parameter space (for evaluating marginals for estimation, and marginal likelihood for model comparison), we seek models that allow us to do as much integration analytically as possible. Here we focus on two complementary choices, one allowing analytical phase marginalization, the other, a semiparametric model allowing analytical shape parameter marginalization.</p><p>Since products of ρ(θ) appear in the likelihood, consider a log-sinusoidal model, so that multiplication of rates leads to sums of sinusoids in the likelihood. Since ρ(θ) must be normalized, this corresponds to taking ρ proportional to a von Mises distribution,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ρ(θ) = 1 I0(κ) e κ cos(θ) ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where I0(κ) denotes the modified Bessel function of order 0. This model has a single shape parameter, the concentration parameter, κ, that simultaneously controls the width of the peak in the light curve, and the peak-to-trough ratio (or pulse fraction).</p><p>If we assign a uniform prior distribution for the phase (implied by time translation invariance), a straightforward calculation gives the marginal likelihood function for frequency and concentration:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L(ω, κ) = I0[κR(ω)] [I0(κ)] N .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The Rayleigh statistic arises as a kind of sufficient statistic for estimation of frequency and concentration for a log-sinusoid model. Interestingly, the κ dependence depends only on the value of R and the sample size. Using asymptotic properties of the Bessel function one can show that, when there is potential evidence for a signal at a particular frequency (amounting to R &gt; √ N ), the likelihood is approximately a gamma distribution in κ. Also, the likelihood function strongly correlates ω and κ, so that the likelihood is largest at frequencies for which the concentration would be estimated as large (which is intuitively sensible). A gamma distribution prior for κ would be asymptotically conjugate. This is an interesting development because it opens the door to Bayesian inference using computational tools already at hand for use of the Rayleigh statistic (see Connors 1997 for a tutorial example calculation). Bayesian inferences for frequency, and for signal detection (via model comparison), require integration of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> over κ, but this is not a significant complication. A table of values of the integral may be pre-computed at the start of the period search, as a function of R, and interpolated for the final calculations. Benefits of this Bayesian counterpart to the Rayleigh test include simpler interpretation of results (e.g., probability for a signal vs. a p-value), the possibility of integrating the results into a multilevel model for population inferences, and the absence of complex, sample-dependent corrections for non-independent test multiplicity due to oversampling.</p><p>The complexity of the light curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> indicates that a model allowing more structure than a single, smooth peak per period will be better able to detect pulsars than the simple log-sinusoid model. Ideally, one might consider a richly flexible nonparametric model for ρ(θ), the overall model now being semiparametric (with scalar parameters f , ˙ f , and φ). But the scale of the (f, ˙ f ) search precludes use of a computationally complex model. Inspired by the χ 2 -EF method, Gregory and Loredo (1992; GL92) consider a piecewise constant shape (PCS) model for ρ(θ), with ρ constant across M equal-width phase bins. Allowing M to be determined by the data makes this model semiparametric in spirit (in the fashion of a sieve), if not formally nonparametric.</p><p>The PCS shape function may be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ρ(θ) = AM f j(θ) , with j(θ) = ⌊1 + M (θ mod 2π)/2π⌋ ,<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where the step parameters f = {fj } specify the relative amplitudes of M steps, each of width 1/M period; with this parameterization, the step parameters are constrained to be positive and to lie on the unit simplex, j fj = 1. The (marginal) likelihood function for angular frequency, phase, and shape then has the form of a multinomial distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">L(ω, φ, f ) = M N M j=1 f n j j ,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>where nj = nj (ω, φ) is the number of events whose times place them in segment j of the lightcurve, given the phase and frequency. These numbers correspond to the counts in bin j in the EF method. The appeal of the PCS model is the simple dependence on f , which allows analytic marginalization over shape if a conjugate prior is used. GL92 adopted a flat shape prior, π(f ) = 1/M !. With this choice, the marginal likelihood for frequency, phase, and M is</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">L(ω, φ) = M N (M − 1)! (N + M − 1)! n1! n2! . . . nM ! N ! .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>Only the term in brackets depends on ω and φ. It is just the reciprocal of the multiplicity of the set of nj values-the number of ways N events can be distributed in M bins with nj events in each bin. Physicists know its logarithm as the configurational entropy of the {nj }. In fact, I devised this model specifically to obtain this result, formalizing a clever intuition of Gregory's that entropy provides a measure of distance of a binned distribution from a uniform distribution that could be superior to the χ 2 statistic used in χ 2 -EF. In a Bayesian setting, the reciprocal multiplicity provides more than a simple test statistic; it enables calculation of posterior probabilities for frequency, phase, and the number of bins. Further, by model averaging (over the choice of M , phase and frequency), one can estimate the light curve shape without committing to a particular binned representation. A collection of pointwise estimates of ρ(θ) vs. θ is smooth (albeit somewhat "boxy"), though considered as a function the estimate is outside the support of the model. A drawback of the PCS model is that the phase parameter may not be marginalized analytically. Numerical quadrature must be used, which makes the approach significantly more computationally burdensome than the log-Fourier model (though not more burdensome than phase-averaged χ 2 -EF). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of the PCS model in action, from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gregory and Loredo (1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">GL96)</ref>. These results use data from ROSAT satellite observations of X-ray pulsar PSR 0540−693, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small irregular galaxy companion to the Milky Way. This pulsar was first detected in earlier data from the Einstein Observatory ( <ref type="bibr">Seward et al. 1984)</ref>; it is fast, with a period of ≈ 50 ms. Later, less sensitive ROSAT observations were undertaken to confirm the detection and improve the estimated parameters, but the pulsar was not detectable using the Rayleigh statistic (implemented via FFT). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2a</ref> shows the marginal likelihood for the pulsar frequency for a 5-bin model, scaled to give the conditional odds in favor of a periodic model over a constant model, were the frequency specified a priori (and the constant model considered equally probable to the set of models with M = 2 to 10 a priori). In fact, the prior measurements predicted the frequency to lie within a range spanning 6×10 −4 Hz (containing about 144 Fourier frequencies for this data spanning T = 116, 341 s). Marginalizing over this range gives odds vs. M as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2b</ref>. There is overwhelming evidence for the pulsar. Further results, including light curve estimates and comparison with χ 2 -EF, are in GL96. A connection of the PCS model to χ 2 -EF is worth highlighting. Using Stirling's approximation for the factorials in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref>, one can show that, for large numbers of counts in the bins,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">log L(ω, φ) ≈ 1 2 χ 2 + 1 2 j log nj + C(M ),<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where C(M ) is a constant depending on M , and χ 2 is the same statistic used in the χ 2 -EF method. In fact, exp[−χ 2 /2] can be a good approximation to the marginal likelihood for ω and φ. Despite this, in simulations the PCS model proves better able to detect weak periodic signals than the phase-averaged χ 2 statistic. The reason probably has less to do with failure of the approximation than with the fact that, from a Bayesian viewpoint, the proper quantity to average over phase is not χ 2 , but exp[−χ 2 /2]. Ad hoc averaging of χ 2 to eliminate the phase nuisance parameter essentially "oversmooths" in comparison to a proper marginalization. The launch of Fermi has renewed interest in improving our capability to detect weak periodic signals in arrival time series. On the computational front, important recent advances include the use of tapered transforms ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atwood et al. 2006</ref>) and</p><p>The Pulsating Sky 15 dynamic programming ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Meinshausen et al. 2009</ref>) to accelerate (f, ˙ f ) exploration (in the context of Rayleigh and Z 2 m statistics). Statistically, the most important recent development is the introduction of likelihood-based score tests by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bickel et al. (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bickel et al. ( , 2008</ref>. Inspired by the recent theoretical work on the limited power of omnibus tests describe in § 2, these tests seek high power in a family of models built with a Fourier basis. An interesting innovation of this approach is the use of averaging over frequency, rather than maximizing, to account for frequency uncertainty. As in the χ 2 -EF case, the averaging is of a quantity that is roughly the logarithm of the marginal likelihood that would appear in a Bayesian log-Fourier model. It seems likely that a fully Bayesian treatment of an analogous model could do better, though generalizing the log-sinusoid model described above to include multiple harmonics is not trivial (Loredo 1993).</p><p>On the Bayesian front, a simple modification may improve the capability of the PCS model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 3a,b</ref> show draws of shapes using the flat prior for M = 5 and M = 30; the shapes grow increasingly flat with growing M . A better prior would aim to stay variable as M increases. Consider the family of conjugate symmetric Dirichlet priors (to keep the calculation analytic),</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">π(f ) ∝ δ 1 − j fj j f α−1 j .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>One way to maintain variability is to make α depend on M in a manner that keeps the relative standard deviation of any particular fj constant with M . More fundamentally, we might seek to make the family of priors divisible. Both requirements point to the same fix: take α = C/M , for some constant C. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3c</ref> shows samples from an M = 30 prior with α = 2/M (the M = 2 prior would be flat for this choice); variability is restored. Informally, we might set C a priori based on examination of known light curves. Alternately, inferring C from the data, either case-by-case or for populations (e.g., separately for X-ray and gamma-ray pulsars), may provide useful insights into pulsar properties. These avenues are currently being explored. A possible approach for using more complex nonparametric Bayesian models may be to use a computationally inexpensive method, like the log-sinusoid model or the dynamic programming search algorithm of Bickel et al., for a "first pass" analysis that identifies promising regions of (f, ˙ f ) space. The more complicated analysis would only be undertaken in the resulting target regions. However, the regions may still be large enough to significantly constrain the complexity of nonparametric modeling.</p><p>We close this section with an observation about the apparently boring null hypothesis, traditionally framed as a constant rate model, r(t) = A. It may be more accurate to frame it as a constant shape model, ρ(θ) = 1. These do not quite amount to the same thing, because in the shape description, we implicitly have a candidate period in play, and we are asserting flatness of a "per period" or folded rate. In fact, few X-ray or gamma-ray sources have constant observed fluxes over the duration of pulsar search observations. Sources often vary in luminosity in complex ways over time scales of hours and days. In some cases, the flux may vary because a survey instrument is not always pointing directly at the source. Although the rate as a function examined over the full duration, T , may strongly vary, when folded over candidate periods (always much smaller than T ) and viewed vs. phase, it may be very close to constant. This is essentially an example of Poincaré's "method of arbitrary functions" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Diaconis and Engel 1986)</ref>. Similar considerations apply to periodic models: models allowing period-to-period variability but with a periodic expected rate can lead to the same likelihood function as the strictly periodic models considered above. These considerations remind us that our hypotheses are always in some sense a caricature of reality, but that in some cases we may be able to formally justify the caricature.</p></div>

Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter Longer than sun or any revolving satellite, Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades. -Walt Whitman Ancient sky-watchers noted the complex movement of the planets with respect to the fixed stars; in fact, "planet" derives from the Greek word for "wanderer." Even before the heliocentric models of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, this motion was attributed to revolution of the planets around a host object, originally Earth, later the Sun. By Newton's time, a more sophisticated view emerged: For an inertial observer (one experiencing no measurable acceleration), the planets and the Sun appear to orbit around their common center of mass. The Sun is so much more massive than even the most massive planet, Jupiter, that the center of mass of the solar system-the barycenter-lies within the Sun (its offset from the Sun's center is of order the solar radius, in a direction determined mostly by the positions of Jupiter and Saturn). The heliocentric descriptions of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler were approximations. Had they been able to make precise observations of the solar system from a vantage point above the ecliptic plane, they would have not only seen the planets whirling about in large, elliptical, periodic orbits; they would have also seen the Sun executing a complex, wobbling dance, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p><p>What the ancients could not see, and what modern instruments reveal, is that some of the "fixed" visible stars are in fact wobbling on the sky, sketching out small ellipses or more complex patterns similar to the Sun's unnoticed wobble. The largest motions arise from pairs of stars orbiting each other. But in the last 15 years, as a consequence of dramatic advances in astronomers' ability to measure stellar motions, over 400 stars have been seen to wobble in a manner indicating the presence of exoplanets.</p><p>To date, the most prolific technique for detecting exoplanets is the Doppler radial velocity "RV" technique. Rather than measuring the position of a star on the sky versus time (which would require extraordinary angular precision only now being achieved), this technique measures the line-of-sight velocity of a star as a function of time-the toward-and-away wobble rather than the side-to-side wobble. This is possible using high precision spectroscopic observations of lines in a star's spectrum; the wavelengths of the lines shift very slightly in time due to the Doppler effect. Radial velocities as small as a meter per second may be accurately measured this way.</p><p>The resulting data comprise a time series of velocities measured with additive noise, and irregularly spaced in time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> depicts a typical data set and the currently dominant analysis method. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4a</ref> shows the velocity data; due to noise and the irregular spacing, the kind of periodic time dependence expected from orbital reflex motion is not visually evident, though it is clear something is going on that noise alone cannot account for. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4b</ref> shows a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the data. The resulting power spectrum is very complex but has a clearly dominant peak. The period corresponding to the peak is used to initialize a χ 2 minimization algorithm that attempts to fit the data with a Keplerian orbit model, a strongly nonlinear model describing the motion as periodic, planar, and elliptical. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4c</ref> shows the data folded with respect to the estimated period, with the estimated Keplerian velocity curve; an impressive fit results. For some systems, the residuals are large, and further periodic components may be found by interative fitting of residuals, corresponding to multiple-planet systems.</p><p>This setting offers an interesting complement to pulsar data analysis. In both problems, astronomers are searching for periodic signals. But for planets, there is a highly accurate parametric model for the signal. Also, there is no period derivative to contend with, and the number of frequencies to examine in a blind search is typically thousands to hundreds of thousands, rather than many millions or a billion (because the highest frequencies of interest are far lower than in the pulsar case). As a result, although periodograms are part of the astronomer's tool kit in both settings, in other respects, the data analysis methodologies differ greatly.</p><p>A number of challenges face astronomers analyzing exoplanet RV data with conventional techniques. The likelihood is highly multimodal, and in some cases nonregular (e.g., for some orbital parameters, such as orbital eccentricity, the likelihood is maximized on a boundary of parameter space). The model is highly nonlinear. As a consequence, Wilks's theorem is not valid, and it becomes challenging to compute confidence regions from χ 2 results. Astronomers seek to use the orbital models to estimate derived quantities such as planet masses, or to make predictions of future motion for future observation; propagation of uncertainty in such calculations is difficult. As noted above, the LSP implicitly presumes a sinusoidal signal, which corresponds to circular motion. But many exoplanets are found to be in eccentric orbits, so the LSP is suboptimal for exoplanet detection. These challenges make it difficult to quantify uncertainty in marginal detections. As a result, only systems with unambiguous detections are announced, and the implications of data from thousands of examined systems with no obvious signals remains unquantified. Finally, much of the interesting astrophysics of exoplanet formation requires accurate inference of population properties, but results produced by conventional methods make it challenging to perform accurate population-level inferences. Several investigators have independently turned to Bayesian methods to address these challenges ( <ref type="bibr">Chernoff 2000, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cumming 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ford 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gre- gory 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balan and Lahav 2008)</ref>. Here I will briefly describe ongoing work I am pursuing in collaboration with my astronomer colleague David Chernoff, and with statisticians Bin Liu, Merlise Clyde, and James Berger. The most novel aspect of our work applies the theory of Bayesian experimental design to the problem of adaptive scheduling of observations of exoplanets. Exoplanet observations use stateof-the-art instrumentation; the observations are expensive, and observers compete for time on shared telescope facilities. It is important to optimize use of these resources. This concern will be even stronger for use of upcoming space-based facilities that will enable measurement of the motion of the side-to-side positional wobble of nearby stars. Only relatively recently have simulation-based computational techniques made it feasible to implement Bayesian experimental design with nonlinear models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Clyde et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Müller and Parmigiani 1995a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Müller 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian experimental design is an application of Bayesian decision theory, and requires specification of a utility function to guide design. Astronomers have varied goals for exoplanet observations. Some are interested in detecting individual systems; others seek systems of a particular type (e.g., with Earth-like planets) and may want to accurately predict planet positions for future observations (e.g., of transits of a planet across the disc of its host star); others may be interested in population properties. No single, tractable utility function can directly target all of these needs. We thus adopt an information-based utility function, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lindley (1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lindley ( , 1972</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bernardo (1979)</ref>, as a kind of "general purpose" utility.</p><p>As a simple example, consider observation of an exoplanet system with a single detected planet, with the goal of refining the posterior distribution for the orbital parameters, θ. Denote the currently available data by D, and let M1 denote the information specifying the single-planet Keplerian orbit model. The current posterior distribution for the orbital parameters is then p(θ|D, M1) (we will suppress M1 for the time being). For an experiment, e, producing future data de, the updated posterior will be p <ref type="figure">(θ|de, D)</ref>; here e labels the action space (e.g., the time for a future observation), and de is the associated (uncertain) outcome. We take the utility to be the information in the updated posterior, quantified by the negative Shannon entropy,</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">I(e, de) = dθ p(θ|de, D) log [p(θ|de, D)]<label>(23)</label></formula><p>(using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original and updated posterior produces the same results; we use the Shannon entropy here for simplicity). The optimal experiment maximizes the expected information, calculated by averaging over the uncertain value of de;</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">EI(e) = dde p(de|D) I(e, de),<label>(24)</label></formula><p>where the predictive distribution for the future data is</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">p(de|D) = dθ p(θ|D)p(de|θ).<label>(25)</label></formula><p>Calculating the expected information in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(24)</ref> requires evaluating a triply-nested set of integrals (two over the parameter space, and one over the future sample space); we must then optimize this over e. This is a formidable calculation. But a significant simplification is available in some settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sebastiani and Wynn (2000)</ref> point out that when the information in the future sampling distribution, p(de|θ), is independent of the choice of hypothesis (i.e., the parameters, θ), the expected information simplifies;</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">EI(e) = C − dde p(de|θ) log[p(de|θ)],<label>(26)</label></formula><p>where C is a constant (measuring the e-independent information in the prior and the sampling distribution). The integral (including the minus sign) is the Shannon entropy in the predictive distribution. Thus the experiment that maximizes the expected information is the one for which the predictive distribution has minimum information, or maximum entropy. The strategy of sampling in this optimal way is called maximum entropy sampling (MaxEnt sampling). Colloquially, this strategy says we will learn the most by sampling where we know the least, an appealingly intuitive criterion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. J. Loredo</head><p>As a simplified example, consider an RV data model with measurements given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">di = V (ti; τ, e, K) + ǫi,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where ǫi denotes zero-mean Gaussian noise terms with known variance σ 2 , and V (ti; τ, e, K) gives the Keplerian velocity along the line of site as a function of time ti and of the orbital parameters τ (period), e (eccentricity), and K (velocity amplitude). For simplicity two additional parameters required in an accurate model are held fixed: a parameter describing the orbit orientation, and a parameter specifying the origin of time. The velocity function is strongly nonlinear in all variables except K (its calculation requires solving a famous transcendental equation, the Kepler equation; see Danby 1992 for details). Our goal is to learn about the parameters τ , e and K. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows results from a typical simulation iterating an observation-inferencedesign cycle a few times. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5a</ref> shows simulated data from a hypothetical "setup" observation stage. Observations were made at 10 equispaced times; the curve shows the true orbit with typical exoplanet parameters (τ = 800 d, e = 0.5, K = 50 ms −1 ), and the noise distribution is Gaussian with zero mean and σ = 8 m s −1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5b</ref> shows some results from the inference stage using these data. Shown are 100 samples from the marginal posterior density for τ and e (obtained with a simple but inefficient accept/reject algorithm). There is significant uncertainty that would not be well approximated by a Gaussian (even correlated). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5c</ref> illustrates the design stage. The thin curves display the uncertainty in the predictive distribution as a function of sample time; they show the V (t) curves associated with 15 of the parameter samples from the inference stage. The spread among these curves at a particular time displays the uncertainty in the predictive distribution at that time. A Monte Carlo calculation of the expected information vs. t (using all 100 samples) is plotted as the thick curve (right axis, in bits, offset so the minimum is at 0 bits). The curve peaks at t = 1925 d, the time used for observing in the next cycle. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5d</ref> shows interim results from the inference stage of the next cycle after making a single simulated observation at the optimal time. The period uncertainty has decreased by more than a factor of two, and the product of the posterior standard deviations of all three parameters (a crude measure of "posterior volume") has decreased by a factor ≈ 5.8; this was accomplished by incorporating the information from a single well-chosen datum. Figures 5e,f show similar results from the next two cycles. The posterior volume continues to decrease much more rapidly than one would expect from the random-sampling " √ N rule" (by factors of ≈ 3.9 and 1.8). To implement this approach with the full Keplerian RV model requires a nontrivial posterior sampling algorithm. One pipeline we have developed is inspired by the conventional LSP+χ 2 technique. As a starting point, we use the fact that the Keplerian velocity model is a separable nonlinear model, which may be reparameterized as a linear superposition of two nonlinear components. We can analytically marginalize over the two linear parameters, producing a marginal likelihood for three nonlinear parameters: τ , e, and an origin-of-time parameter, µ0 (an angle denoting the orbit orientation at t = 0). We eliminate e and µ0, either by crude quadrature, or by using heuristics from Fourier analysis of the Keplerian model to estimate values from a simple harmonic fit to the data. This produces an approximate marginal likelihood for period that we call a Kepler periodogram (K-gram). It plays the role of the LSP in the conventional analysis, but accounts for orbital eccentricity. The K-gram (multiplied by a log-flat prior in period) is an approximate marginal density for the period. Rather than use a periodogram peak to initialize a χ 2 parameter fit, we draw ∼ 10 to 20 samples from the K-gram to define an initial population of candidate orbits. Finally, we evolve the population using a population-based adaptive MCMC algorithm. Our current pipeline uses the differential evolution MCMC algorithm of Ter <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Braak (2006)</ref>. When applied to simulated and real data for systems with a single, well-detected exoplanet, this pipeline produces posterior samples much more efficiently than other recently-developed algorithms (e.g., the random walk Metropolis algorithm of Ford 2005, or the parallel tempering algorithm of Gregory 2005). The success of the algorithm appears due to the "smart start" provided by the K-gram, and the adaptivity of population-based MCMC.</p><p>However, this pipeline has limitations that have led us to explore more thoroughgoing departures from existing algorithms. The first limitation is that when there is significant multimodality (i.e., more than one mode with significant posterior probability), our population-based sampler explores parameter space much less efficiently due to the difficulty of swapping between modes.</p><p>The second limitation is more fundamental. So far, we have focused on adaptive design for parameter estimation, presuming the stellar target is known to host a star. In fact, initially we will not know whether a star hosts a planet or not; we initially need to optimize for detection (i.e., model comparison), not estimation. Even after a planet is detected, while we would like future observations to improve the orbital parameter estimates, we would also like the observational design to consider the possibility that an additional planet may be present.</p><p>To pursue more general design goals, we introduce a set of models, M k , with k planets (k = 0 to a few), with associated parameter spaces θ k . Write the joint posterior for the models and their parameters as</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">p(M k , θ k |de, D) = p(M k |de, D)p(θ k |de, D, M k ) ≡ p k q k (θ k ),<label>(28)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>T. J. Loredo where p k is the posterior probability for M k , and q k (θ k ) is the posterior density for the parameters of model M k . Then the information in the joint posterior is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">I[M k , θ k |D] = k dθ k p k q k (θ k ) log[p k q k (θ k )] (29) = k p k log p k + k p k dθ k q k (θ k ) log q k (θ k ). (30)</formula><p>The first sum in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(30)</ref> is the information (negative entropy) in the posterior over the models; the second sum averages the information in the various posterior densities, weighted by the model probabilities. Once the data begin to focus on a particular model (so one of the p k values approaches unity and the others approach zero), the first term will nearly vanish, and the sum comprising the second term will be dominated by the term quantifying the information in the posterior density for the best model. That is, the parameter estimation case described above is recovered. When model uncertainty is signficant, the first term plays a significant role, allowing model uncertainty to drive the design. This utility thus naturally moves between optimizing for detection and for parameter estimation. We have found that Borth (1975) derived essentially the same criterion, dubbed a total entropy criterion, though it has gone unused for decades, presumably because the required calculations are challenging. Three features make use of this more general criterion significantly more challenging than MaxEnt sampling. First, model probabilities are needed, requiring calculation of marginal likelihoods (MLs) for the models. MCMC methods do not directly estimate MLs; they must be supplemented with other techniques, or MCMC must be abandoned for another approach. Second, the condition leading to the MaxEnt simplification in the parameter estimation case-that the entropy in the predictive distribution not depend on the choice of hypothesis-does not hold when the hypothesis space includes composite hypotheses (marginalization over rival models' parameter spaces breaks the condition).</p><p>Finally, for adaptive design for parameter estimation above, we adopted a greedy algorithm, optimizing one step ahead. For model choice, it is typically the case that non-greedy designs significantly out-perform greedy designs (more so than for parameter estimation). This significantly complicates the optimization step.</p><p>Motivated by these challenges, we have developed an alternative computational approach that aims to calculate marginal likelihoods directly, producing posterior samples as a byproduct: annealing adaptive importance sampling (AAIS). This algorithm anneals a target distribution (prior times likelihood for a particular model), and adapts an importance sampler built out of a mixture of multivariate Student-t distributions to the sequence of annealed targets, using techniques from sequential Monte Carlo. The number of components in the mixture adapts via birth, death, merge and split operations; the parameters of each component adapt via expectation-maximization algorithm steps. The algorithm currently works well on several published data sets with multimodal posteriors and either one or two planets. A forthcoming publication ( <ref type="bibr">Liu et al. 2011</ref>) provides details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">PERSPECTIVE</head><p>I have highlighted here only two among many areas in astronomy where astronomers study periodic phenomena. So far Bayesian methods are relatively new for such problems. I know of only two other applications where astronomers are studying periodic phenomena with Bayesian methods: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berger et al. (2003)</ref> address nonparametric modeling of Cepheid variable stars that are used to measure distances to nearby galaxies (via correlation between luminosity and period) <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Brewer et al. (see White et al. 2010</ref> and references therein) address detection and estimation of low-amplitude, nearly-periodic oscillations in stellar luminosities (asteroseismology).</p><p>Broadening the perspective beyond periodic phenomena, astronomy is on the verge of a revolution in the amount of time-domain data available. Within a decade, what was once the science of the fixed stars will become a thoroughly time-domain science. While much time-domain astronomy to date has come from targeted observations, upcoming large-scale surveys will soon produce "whole-sky time-lapse movies" with many-epoch multi-color observations of hundreds of millions of sources. The prime example is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will begin producing such data in 2019. Hopefully the vastness and richness of the new data will encourage further development of Bayesian tools for exploring the dynamic sky.</p><p>In this decade marking dramatic growth in the importance and public visibility of time-domain astronomy, it is perhaps not surprising to find contemporary writers relinquishing stars as symbols of steadfastness; they are instead symbols of enduring mystery. In her poem, "Stars" (Manfred 2008), Wisconsin-based poet Freya Manfred depicts a moment of exasperation at life in a mercurial world, with the poet finding herself "past hanging on." One thing is able to distract her from the vagaries of daily life-not the illusory steadfastness of the once fixed stars, but the enigma of the pulsating sky:</p><p>But I don't care about your birthday, or Christmas, or lover's lane, or even you, not as much as I pretend. Ah, I was about to say, "I don't care about the stars" -but I had to stop my pen.</p><p>Sometimes, out in the silent black Wisconsin countryside I glance up and see everything that's not on earth, glowing, pulsing, each star so close to the next and yet so far away.</p><p>Oh, the stars. In lines and curves, with fainter, more mysterious designs beyond, and again, beyond. The longer I look, the more I see, and the more I see, the deeper the universe grows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response to discussion by Peter Müller</head><p>As a non-statistician interloper of sorts, I am grateful to the organizers for the privilege of being invited to participate in this last Valencia meeting, and for assigning me so effective (and gracious) a discussant. Prof. Peter Müller presents a number of useful new ideas and clarifying questions in his deceptively short discussion. I will touch on a selection of his points in this response; limits of space provide me a convenient excuse for postponing the address of other important points for another forum where I may have "pages enough and time" to explore Müller's suggestions more fully.</p><p>For the pulsar detection problem, Müller suggests changing the prior to a symmetric Dirichlet prior with a small exponent in order to favor light curve shapes with spikes. With a similar motivation, in the paper I proposed adopting a divisible Dirichlet prior, say with α = 2/M for the M -bin shape model. This becomes a small-α prior once M is larger than a few. Preliminary calculations indicate this is a promising direction, but not entirely satisfactory. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows, as a function of number of bins, the Bayes factor for a model using the divisible prior versus one using the Gregory &amp; Loredo flat prior, for three representative types of data. For data distributing events uniformly across the bins, the (red) squares show that adopting the divisible prior allows one to more securely reject periodic models. For data placing all events in a single-bin pulse, the (blue) diamonds show that the divisible prior results in dramatically increased sensitivity to pulsations. However, as is evident in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> in the paper, gamma-ray pulsations typically ride on top of a constant background component. Adding such a component to the single-bin pulse data (at about 9% of the pulse level) produces the Bayes factors indicated by the (green) circles; these indicate less sensitivity to pulsations with the divisible prior than with the flat prior. Small-α priors put prior mass on truly spiked signals, with all events in very few bins. This preference has to be tempered in order to realistically model pulsar light curves with a background component. I am exploring how to achieve this, following some of Müller's leads.</p><p>Müller raised questions about treatment of two parameters in the semiparametric pulsar light curve model: the pulse phase, φ, and the frequency, f . Rightly noting that the shape prior is shift-invariant, he asks if φ may be eliminated altogether. But the likelihood is not shift-invariant. For example, for a particular choice of M , there could be a pulse that is, say, nearly exactly two bins wide. Depending on φ, the events from this pulse may be concentrated in two bins, or spread out over three; the former case has higher likelihood.</p><p>Regarding frequency, Müller asks, why not "treat the unknown period as another parameter." This points to a weakness in my description. From a probabilistic point of view, the frequency is handled as a parameter in the same manner as other parameters. The comments at the end of Section 2, regarding the contrast between Bayesian marginalization over frequency and frequentist maximization over frequency, extend to how we treat frequency uncertainty in both the pulsar and exoplanet problems. It just happens that there is so much structure in the frequency dimension (nearly as many modes as Fourier frequencies), that something like exhaustive search is the best way we currently know of for making sure we find the dominant modes among the dense forest of modes. I say "something like exhaustive search" because there are clever ways to explore the frequency parameter without doing the naive search described before equation (10). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atwood et al. (2006)</ref> show how to use time-difference tapering to do the search efficiently; Meinshausen et al. (2009) describe a more complex but potentially more powerful and general approach combining tapering with dynamic programming to maximize power subject to computational resource constraints (and incidentally showing how much may be gained by having statisticians work on the problem). In the pulsar problem, the mode forest is too dense for exploration using standard Monte Carlo methods. But for the exoplanet problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Gregory (2007)</ref> has successfully used parallel tempering for frequency search; it requires millions of likelihood evaluations, indicating it would be unfeasible for pulsar blind searching (where the number of modes is vastly larger).</p><p>For the exoplanet adaptive scheduling problem, Müller suggests m-step look ahead procedures may out-perform our myopic procedure, an issue that has concerned our exoplanet team but which we have yet to significantly explore. The sequential design folklore that has motivated our efforts to date is that, for parameter estimation, m-step look ahead tends not to yield significant gains over myopic designs, but that for model comparison, few-step look ahead can perform significantly better than myopic design. We have devised a heuristic few-step look ahead approach for the model comparison problem of planet detection, but we cannot say yet how much it gains us over myopic designs. The earliest expression of the folklore that I have come across is a paper by Chernoff on sequential design <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Chernoff 1961)</ref>. He observes: "The sequential experimentation problem for estimation. . . seems to be substantially the same problem as that of finding 'locally' optimal experiments. . . . On the other hand the sequential experimentation problem of testing hypotheses does not degenerate and is by no means trivial." It would be valuable to have more theoretical insight into the folklore, particularly from a Bayesian perspective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. J. Loredo</head><p>Finally, Müller offers questions and suggestions pertaining to the choice of utility for orbit estimation and for handling model uncertainty (planet detection). Since the observations will ultimately be used by various investigators for different purposes, some generic measure of information in the posterior distribution seems appropriate, though with the future use of inferences being somewhat vague, there cannot be any single "correct" choice. Our use of Kullback-Leibler divergence (or, equivalently here, Shannon entropy) is motivated by the same intuition motivating Müller's suggestion to use precision (which I take to mean inverse variance): we want the data to tell us as much about the parameters as possible. Precision does not appeal to us because exoplanet posterior distributions can be complex, with significant skewness, nonlinear correlations, multiple modes, and modes on boundaries of the parameter space (especially for orbital eccentricity, bounded to [0, 1) and often near a boundary for physical reasons). In this setting, precision seems an inadequate summary of uncertainty. In the limit where the posterior is unimodal and approximately normal, the entropic measures become the logarithm of the precision (in the multivariate sense of determinant of the inverse covariance matrix). We thus think of these measures as providing a kind of "generalized precision."</p><p>Noting that the total entropy criterion for the joint estimation/model comparison problem reduces to separate terms for model and parameter uncertainty, Müller suggests generalizing the criterion to encode an explicit tradeoff between the estimation and model choice tasks. This is an intriguing idea. At the moment I cannot see obvious astrophysical criteria that would enable quantification of such a tradeoff. But Müller's suggestion, along with his observation that sampling cost is not in our formulation, present me an opportunity to clarify how complex the actual observing decisions are for astronomers.</p><p>Mission planners for space-based missions, or telescope allocation committees (TACs) for ground-based observatories, must schedule observations of many sources. For exoplanet campaigns, they will be considering as-yet unexamined systems, and systems known to have a planet but with diverse coverage of prior data. Most exoplanet campaigns share telescopes with observers pursuing completely different science. Schedulers must make tradeoffs between science goals within the exoplanet campaign, and between it and competing science. There are costs associated with observations, but there are other nontrivial constraints as well, such as weather patterns and the phase of the moon ("dark time" near the new moon is at a premium; dimmer sources may be observed then). In principle one could imagine formal formulation of the decision problems facing mission planners and TACs, taking all of these complications into account via utilities or losses. This may be a worthwhile exercise for a focused mission (e.g., devoted solely to exoplanet observations); in more general settings the criteria are probably too hopelessly subjective to allow quantification. In all of these settings, we think it would be useful for exoplanet observers to be able to provide expected information gain versus time calculations, simply as one useful input for complex scheduling decisions. Müller's description of our approach as a "useful default" is more apt than he may have realized. Sequential design is relatively new to astronomy; we hope we can follow up on some of Müller's insightful suggestions as the field moves beyond these starting points.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>7 3.</head><label>7</label><figDesc>PULSAR SCIENCE WITH SPARSE ARRIVAL TIME SERIES So near you are, summer stars, So near, strumming, strumming, So lazy and hum-strumming. -Carl Sandberg</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> This shared, independent prior assumption is a reasonable starting point for analyzing individual systems, but deserves further consideration when population modeling is a goal, since different physics may underly emission from pulsars and non-pulsating neutron stars, and the expected amplitude of pulsar emission likely depends on frequency (and other parameters). Since amplitude and frequency are precisely estimated when a signal is detectable, population modeling may be simplified in an empirical Bayes spirit by inserting conditional prior factors, conditioned on the estimated amplitude and frequency.</note>
