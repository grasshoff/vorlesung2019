				<p>Context. Regular follow-up of imaged companions to main-sequence stars often allows to detect a projected orbital motion. MCMC has become very popular in recent years for fitting and constraining their orbits. Some of these imaged companions appear to move on very eccentric, possibly unbound orbits. This is in particular the case for the exoplanet Fomalhaut b and the brown dwarf companion PZ Tel B on which we focus here. Aims. For such orbits, standard MCMC codes assuming only bound orbits may be inappropriate. Our goal is to develop a new MCMC implementation able to handle bound and unbound orbits as well in a continuous manner, and to apply it to the cases of Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Methods. We present here this code, based on the use of universal Keplerian variables and Stumpff functions. We present two versions of this code, the second one using a different set of angular variables designed to avoid degeneracies arising when the projected orbital motion is quasi-radial, as it is the case for PZ Tel B. We also present additional observations of PZ Tel B Results. The code is applied to Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Concerning Fomalhaut b, we confirm previous results, but we show that on the sole basis of the astrometric data, open orbital solutions are also possible. The eccentricity distribution nevertheless still peaks around ∼ 0.9 in the bound regime. We present a first successful orbital fit of PZ Tel B, showing in particular that while both bound and unbound orbital solutions are equally possible, the eccentricity distribution presents a sharp peak very close to e = 1, meaning a quasi-parabolic orbit. Conclusions. It was recently suggested that the presence of unseen inner companions to imaged ones may lead orbital fitting algorithms to artificially give very high eccentricities. We show that this caveat is unlikely to apply to Fomalhaut b. Concerning PZ Tel B, we derive a possible solution involving an inner ∼ 12M Jup companion that would mimic a e = 1 orbit despite a real eccentricity around 0.7, but a dynamical analysis reveals that such a system would not be stable. We thus conclude that our orbital fit is robust.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A growing number of substellar companions are nowadays regularly discovered and characterised by direct imaging. These objects are usually massive (larger than a few Jupiter masses) and orbit at wide separations (typically &lt; 20 AU). Some of them as sufficiently close to their host star to allow detection of their orbital motion. Astrometric follow up gives then access to constraints on their orbits (e.g. HR8799 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Soummer et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pueyo et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Maire et al. 2015</ref>) (β Pictoris <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bonnefoy et al. 2014</ref>). The use of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to fit orbits of substellar or planetary companions has become common now <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ford 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kalas et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Nelson et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pueyo et al. 2015</ref>). This statistical approach is particularly well suited for directly imaged companions, as</p><p>Send offprint requests to: H. Beust Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile (Program ID: 085.C-0867(B) and 085.C-0277(B)). Correspondence to: Herve.Beust@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr their orbit is usually only partially and unequally covered by observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ginski et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Some of the fitted orbits appear surprisingly very eccentric. This is for instance the case for Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Fomalhaut b is an imaged planetary companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>) orbiting the A3V star Fomalhaut (α Psa, HD 216956, HIP 113368) at ∼ 119 AU. The physical nature of this object is still a matter of debate. It is commonly thought to be a low mass planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Janson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Currie et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Galicher et al. 2013</ref>), but it also has been suggested that the Fomalhaut b image could represent starlight reflected by a cloud of dust grains, possibly bound to a real planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>). The first attempts to fit Fomalhaut b's orbit on the basis of the available astrometric positions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kalas et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. 2014</ref>) reveal a very eccentric, possibly unbound orbit (e &gt; ∼ 0.8). Subsequent dynamical studies on the past history of this planet and its interaction with the dust belt imaged around the star ( <ref type="bibr">Faramaz et al. 2015</ref>) led to the conclusion that another, yet undiscovered planet must be present in this system to control the dynamics of the dust belt, and that Fomalhaut b may MCMC Orbital fitting techniques are usually based on the assumption that the orbit to fit is elliptic, making use of corresponding Keplerian formulas. This can be problematic with orbits with eccentricities close to 1. This can either prevent convergence of the fit, or generate boundaries in the fitted orbit distributions that are not physical, but rather generated by the limitation of the method. Of course, on could design an independent MCMC code based on the use of open orbit formulas. Such a code would try to fit open orbits only. Our goal is to design a code that can handle both kinds of orbits in a continuous manner. Applied to the cases invoked above, this would help deriving for instance a robust estimate of a probability to be bound. This cannot be done using standard Keplerian variables, as the changes of formulas between bound and unbound orbits would generate enough noise to prevent the code to converge. We develop here a MCMC code based on the use of universal Keplerian variables, an elegant reformulation of Keplerian orbits that holds for bound and unbound orbits as well.</p><p>The organisation of the paper is the following : In Sect. 2, we present new VLT/NACO observations of PZ Tel B that we will use together with order data in our fit. Then In Sect. 3, we present the fundamentals of our new code based on universal Keplerian variables. In Sects. 4 and 5, we present its application to the Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B cases respectively. In Sect. 6, we present further modeling based on the suggestion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> that highly eccentric companions could be actually less eccentric that they appear due to the presence of unseen additional inner companions. For the PZ Tel B case, we find one configuration that could indeed generate an apparent very high eccentricity, but we present subsequent dynamical modeling showing that it is in fact unstable. Our conclusions are then presented in Sect. 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">New observations of PZ Tel B</head><p>2.1. Log of the observations PZ Tel B was observed with VLT/NaCo ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lenzen et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rousset et al. 2003</ref>) on <ref type="bibr">September 26, 2010</ref> in the L' band filter (central wavelength=3.8 µm, width=0.62 µm) in pupil-stabilized mode (P.I. Ehrenreich, Program 085.C-0277). The mode was used to subtract the stellar halo using the angular differential imaging (ADI) technique ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marois et al. 2006</ref>), despite the companion could be seen into our raw images.</p><p>The observation sequences, atmospheric conditions (seeing, coherence time τ 0 ), and instrument setup are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. A continuous sequence of 1200 exposures was recorded, split into 8 cubes (N exp ) of 150 images each (NDIT). The detector 512×512 pixel windowing mode was used to allow for having short data integration times (DIT=0.3 s). The ND long neutral density (ND) was placed into the light path for the first and last 8 × 150 frames of the sequence to acquire unsaturated images of the star for the purpose of the calibration of the companion photometry and astrometry. The star core was in the nonlinearity regime for the rest of the 143 exposures. The parallactic angle (θ) over the ND-free exposures ranges from θ start = 10.62 • to θ end = 53.17 • , corresponding to an angular variation of 2.85 times the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) at 350 mas.</p><p>The system was re-observed on June 7, 2011 using the same instrument configuration (Program 087.C-0450, P.I. Ehrenreich). This sequence was recorded under unstable conditions. Nevertheless, the image angular resolution was high enough to resolve the brown-dwarf companion. The observation sequence is similar to the one of September 26, 2010, although the field rotation is reduced (17.55 • ). It is summarized into <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, we recorded one additional epoch of pupilstabilized observations of the PZ Tel system in the K s band (central wavelength=2.18 µm, width=0.35 µm) with NaCo (P.I. Lagrange, Program 087.C-0431). We used the neutral density filter of the instrument (ND Short) adequate to this band to avoid saturating the star. The field rotation was not sufficient to take advantage of the angular differential imaging technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data Reduction</head><p>The reduction of the L'-band observations was carried out by a pipeline developed in Grenoble( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bonnefoy et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. 2012</ref>). The pipeline first applied the basic cosmetic steps (bad pixel removal, nodded frame subtraction) to the raw images. The star was then registered into each individual frames of each cube using a 2D Moffat function adjusted onto the nonsaturated portions of the images. We applied a frame selection inside each cube based on the maximum flux, and on the integrated flux over the PSF core. The cubes were then concatenated to create a master cube.</p><p>Given the relative brightness of the companion and the amount of field rotation for the 2010 observations, we chose to apply the smart-ADI (SADI) flux-conservative algorithm to suppress the stellar halo ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marois et al. 2006</ref>). The algorithm builds for each frame of our observation sequence a model of the stellar halo from the other sequence images for which a companion located at a distance R from the star has moved angularly (because of the field rotation) by more than n× the FWHM (separation criterion). Only the NN (NN ∈ R) frames the closest in time (Depth parameter) and respecting the separation criterion are considered. We defer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marois et al. (2006)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bonnefoy et al. 2011</ref>). These AP were built from the non-saturated exposures of the star taken before and after the ADI observations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>We derive a final contrasts of ∆L = 5.15 ± 0.15 mag. The error accounts for uncertainties on the flux losses estimates, on the evolution of the PSF through the ADI sequence, and on the method used to extract the companion photometry. This new L' band photometry was accounted for the up-to-date analysis of the spectral energy distribution of the companion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Maire et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>Images of the θ Orionis C astrometric field were acquired with an identical setup on September, 24 2010. They were properly reduced with the Eclipse software (Devillard 1997). The position of the stars on the detector were compared to their position on sky measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">McCaughrean &amp; Stauffer (1994)</ref> to derive the instrument orientation to the North of −0.36 ± 0.11 • and a detector plate scale of 27.13 ± 0.09 mas. We used these measurements together with the position of PZ Tel B derived from the negative fake planet injection ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bonnefoy et al. 2011</ref>) to find a PA=59.9 ± 0.7 • and a separation of 374 ± 5 mas for the companion.</p><p>The second epoch of L' band observations was reduced with the IPAG pipeline, but using the classical imaging (CADI) algorithm. The algorithm built a model of the halo valid for all the images of the sequence from the median of all images contained in the sequence. It is more appropriate than the smart-ADI algorithms here because of the small amount of field rotation. Indeed, it would not have been possible to built a model of the halo for each frames of the sequence while respecting a separation criterion of 1 FWHM for all the frames contained in our sequence. The flux losses were estimated in the same way as for the 2010 L'-band observations. We measure a contrast of ∆L = 4.6 ± 0.6 mag. The photometry is less accurate because of the unstable conditions during the observations. The instrument orientation (TN=1.33 ± 0.05 • ) and platescale (27.38 ± 0.08 mas/pixel) were measured onto the images of the binary star HD 113984 <ref type="bibr">(van Dessel &amp; Sinachopoulos 1993</ref>) observed on September 2, 2011. We therefore derive a PA=60.0 ± 0.6 • and separation of 390.0 ± 5.0 mas for the companion.</p><p>We realigned each of the K s band images to the North and median-combined them to create a final image of PZ Tel AB.</p><p>The companion is seen in the images. We removed the stellar halo at the position of the companion making a axial symmetry of the halo around a axis inclined at PA=-45, 0, or 90 • . We integrated the flux of the star and companions into circular apertures of radii 135 mas (5 pixels) to derive a contrast ratio of δK s = 5.46 ± 0.07. The error bars account for the dispersion of contrast found for the different choice of duplication axis for the stellar halo removal. This contrast ratio is consistent within error bars with the one derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mugrauer et al. (2012)</ref> with the same instrumental setup. We measure a PA=60.0 ± 0.6 • and a separation of 390.0 ± 5.0 mas for the system. This astrometry relies on the TN and plate-scale measured on March 03, 11, and reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref>. The astrometry reported in this section assumes that the TN and plate-scale are stable between the observations of the astrometric fields and our observations of PZ Tel. This seems to be the case according to the measurements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Fundamentals of MCMC for high eccentricity and open orbits</head><p>3.1. MCMC for astrometric imaged companions</p><p>The fundamentals of the MCMC method applied to planets detected with radial velocities are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ford (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ford ( , 2006</ref>), and its application to imaged companions are for instance described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref>. The first requirement is to presuppose general probability distributions (commonly called priors) for the orbital elements. For bounds orbits, the usual orbital elements are the semi-major axis a, the eccentricity e, the inclination i, the longitude of ascending node Ω, the argument of periastron ω, and the time for periastron passage t p . The priors for these elements are generally assumed uniform between natural bounds, except for a for which a logarithmic prior (∝ ln a) is often assumed, and for i for which assume a prior ∝ sin i is also of standard use. Combined with uniform prior for Ω, this choice ensures a uniform probability distribution over the sphere for the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector.</p><p>In the building process of a Markov chain, successive orbital solutions are generated from preceding ones taking steps on the orbital variables and selecting or rejecting the generated new orbits using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (hereafter MH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ford 2005</ref>). MCMC theory tells that whenever the chain grows, it is expected to stabilise and the final statistical distribution of orbits within the chain samples the posterior probabilistic distribution of orbital solutions. In practice several chains are run in parallel (we use 10), and Gelman-Rubin criterion on crossed variances is used to check for convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ford 2006</ref>).</p><p>An important point to note is that the variables on which steps are taken with MH are not necessarily the orbital elements listed above themselves, but rather combinations of them. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref> (β Pic b) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref> (Fomalhaut b), the work is done on the parameter vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w 1 = cos(ω + Ω + v 0 ) P , sin(ω + Ω + v 0 ) P , e cos(ω + Ω) √ 1 − e 2 , e sin(ω + Ω) √ 1 − e 2 , (1 − e 2 ) 1/4 sin i 2 cos(ω − Ω), (1 − e 2 ) 1/4 sin i 2 sin(ω − Ω) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P is the orbital period and v 0 is the true anomaly at a reference epoch (typically that of a specific data point of a time close to periastron passage). This choice was dictated by the following considerations :</p><p>-As pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chauvin et al. (2012)</ref>, considering imaged companions, there is a degeneracy in orbital solutions concerning parameters Ω and ω. Considering one potential solution with (Ω, ω) values, the same solution but with (Ω+π, ω+π) exactly gives the same projected orbital motion.</p><p>The only way to lift this degeneracy is to have independent information about which side of the projected orbit (or of the associated disk) is on the foreground, or to have radial velocity measurements. Hence taking steps on Ω and ω in MCMC can generate convergence difficulties with chains oscillating between two symmetric families of solutions. To avoid this difficulty, we consider angles ω + Ω and ω − Ω which are unambiguously determined. It is indeed easy to express the projected Keplerian model as a function of these angles only. -Whenever i = 0, angles Ω and ω are undefined (and so angle ω − Ω), while Ω + ω is still defined. Hence we take variables ∝ sin(i/2) cos(ω − Ω) and ∝ sin(i/2) sin(ω − Ω) to avoid a singularity whenever i → 0. -The same applies to eccentricity. When e vanishes, Ω + ω itself is undefined. This is why we consider variables ∝ e cos(Ω + ω) and ∝ e sin(Ω + ω). -ω + Ω + v 0 is defined even when e = i = 0. This is why we chose it in the remaining variables. But as much as possible, we avoid directly taking steps on angular variables themselves, which can lead to convergence problems with jumps around 2π and similar values. This is why we use cos(ω+Ω+v 0 ) and sin(ω+Ω+v 0 ) in the remaining variables.</p><p>As explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ford (2006)</ref>, the assumed priors are taking into account in MH multiplying the basic probability by the Jacobian of the transformation from the linear vector (ln a, e, sin i, Ω, ω, t p ) to the parameters vectors. This Jacobian reads here</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">J 1 = 1 2 e(1 + e cos v 0 ) (1 − e 2 ) 3 P 2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>3.2. Open orbits and universal variables</p><p>The parameter vector w 1 (1) is well suited to fit low eccentricity orbits. It has nevertheless proved efficiency for high eccentricity orbits as well ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. 2014</ref>). Ford (2006) also gives alternate sets of parameters for such orbits. However, none of them can handle open orbits. Moreover, their validity of the fit close to the boundary e = 1 is questionable. Our goal is to allow MCMC fitting to account for bound or unbound orbits in a continuous manner as well. Some of the variables in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, such as the orbital period P and √ 1 − e 2 are clearly inappropriate and need to be changed. The periastron q is conversely always defined for any type of orbit. So changing P to q and eliminating</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">√ 1 − e 2 in Eqs.</formula><p>(1) could be a first solution. We designed a code based on this idea, which turned out not to be efficient. Convergence of Markov Chains could not be reached after billions of iterations. The reason lies in the Keplerian model assumed. To be able to compute the position and velocity of an orbiting companion at a given time (and subsequently a χ 2 ), one needs to solve Kepler's equation for the eccentric anomaly u as a function the time t.</p><p>Kepler's equation depends on the type of orbit. For an elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic orbit, this equation reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">u − e sin u = M, u 2 + u 3 6 = M, and e sinh u − u = M (3)</formula><p>respectively. In the parabolic case, this equation is called Barker's equation, and u = tan(v/2), where v is the true anomaly. M = n(t − t p ) is the mean anomaly, while n is the mean motion. This equation holds in all cases, but n is defined as µ/a 3 in the elliptic and hyperbolic case, and as µ/8q 3 in the parabolic case, where µ = GM is the dynamical mass (M is the central mass). In the random walk process of a Markov chain, permanent switching between these equations lead to instabilities that prevent convergence. A good way to overcome this difficulty is to move to the universal variable formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Danby &amp; Burkardt 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burkardt &amp; Danby 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Danby 1987)</ref>, which is a very elegant way to provide a unique and continuous alternative to Kepler's equation valid for any kind of orbit. We first define the energy parameter α as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">α = −2E = µ q (1 − e) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where E is the energy per unit mass. This expression is valid for any orbit. Elliptical orbits are characterized by α &gt; 0, parabolic orbits by α = 0 and hyperbolic ones by α &lt; 0. The eccentric anomaly u is then replaced by the universal variable s. For nonparabolic orbits, s is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">s = u √ |α| ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>and as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">s = u 2qn (6)</formula><p>for parabolic orbits. It can be shown that in any case, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">s = 1 − e q t − t p + eY qµ(1 + e) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where Y is the y-coordinate in a local OXY referential frame (X axis pointing towards periastron). This shows that the definition of s is continuous irrespective of the type of orbit. Then, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burkardt &amp; Danby (1983)</ref> show that Kepler's equation can then be rewritten in any case as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">µs 3 c 3 αs 2 + qsc 1 αs 2 = t − t p ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where t is the time, and the c k 's are the Stumpff functions defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">c k (x) = +∞ n=0 (−1) n (2n + k)! x n .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>This formulation of Kepler's equation is valid for any orbit. Using c k (0) = 1/k!, we see that for α = 0 (parabolic orbit), this equation is equivalent to Barker's equation.

This formalism was used by several authors for specific problems, such as Aarseth (1999) for wide binaries in clusters, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caballero &amp; Elipe (2001)</ref> to sole Keplerian problems with additional disturbing potentials ∝ 1/r 2 . The Kepler advancing routines in the popular symplectic N-body packages Swift ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levison &amp; Duncan 1994)</ref> and Mercury (Chambers 1999) are also coded this way for high eccentricity and open orbits. Very recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wisdom &amp; Hernandez (2015)</ref> proposed an alternate formalism that avoids the use of Stumpff functions. They claim it to be more efficient. We did not try to apply that yet and used the Stumpff functions theory instead. Based on the use of Stumpff functions, we designed a new MCMC code, using the following parameter vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">w 2 = q cos(ω + Ω), q sin(ω + Ω), sin i 2 cos(ω − Ω), sin i 2 sin(ω − Ω), e, s 0 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where s 0 is the universal variable at a given reference epoch. The priors are assumed uniform for Ω, ω, e, and t p , logarithmic for q and ∝ sin i for i. The Jacobian of the transformation from (ln q, e, sin i, Ω, ω, t p ) to w 2 reads</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">J 2 = q 2 2 ds dt ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where ds/dt can be obtained as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ds dt = 1 µs 2 c 2 αs 2 + qc 0 αs 2 ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>to be evaluated here at s = s 0 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Transformation of angles</head><p>This new code was able to reach convergence in the Fomalhaut bcase. Convergence appeared however hard to reach in the PZ Tel case. This is due to the structure of the data ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). The astrometric data of PZ Tel B reveal indeed a quasilinear motion nearly aligned with the central star. PZ Tel B's orbit appears extremely eccentric, perhaps unbound, but with a periastron much smaller ( &lt; ∼ 1 AU) than the measured projected distances. In this context, the local reference frame OXYZ may be not well defined. Only the line of apsides OX is likely to be well constrained by the data, while the two other directions require an other nearly arbitrary angular variable to be fixed. The very bad constraint on that angular variable results into degeneracies in the constraints on angles (Ω, ω, i) that are sufficient to prevent convergence. It thus appears necessary to isolate the badly constrained angular variable into a specific variable. This require to change the parameter vector w 2 (Eq. 13).</p><p>With respect to the sky reference frame (x-axis pointing towards north, y-axis towards east, and z-axis towards the Earth), the basis vectors (e X , e Y , e Z ) of the local OXYZ reference frame read</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">e X          cos ω cos Ω − cos i sin ω sin Ω cos ω sin Ω + cos i sin ω cos Ω sin ω sin i , e Y          − sin ω cos Ω − cos i cos ω sin Ω − sin ω sin Ω + cos i cos ω cos Ω cos ω sin i , e Z          sin i sin Ω − sin i cos Ω cos i .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>According to our analysis, in the case of PZ Tel B, only e X is well constrained by the data. This results in complex combined constraints on Ω, ω and i. For instance, if e Z was well constrained by the data, then ω would be the weakly constrained parameter, as e Z is only function of Ω and i. The idea is therefore to define new angles in a similar way as in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref>, but in such a way that e X depends on two angles only. We thus introduce new angles i , Ω and ω designed in such a way that e X is defined with respect to (i , Ω , ω ) in the same manner as e Z is defined with respect to (i, Ω, ω). Similarly e Y will be defined like e X , and e Z like e Y . We thus write now</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">e X            sin i sin Ω − sin i cos Ω cos i , e Y          cos ω cos Ω − cos i sin ω sin Ω cos ω sin Ω + cos i sin ω cos Ω sin ω sin i , e Z          − sin ω cos Ω − cos i cos ω sin Ω − sin ω sin Ω + cos i cos ω cos Ω cos ω sin i .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>The comparison between formulas (16) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> gives the correspondence between the two sets of angles. Now, the line of apsides is defined by i and Ω only, and ω , the badly constrained angular variable, is undefined if q vanishes. It is therefore worth modifying vector w 2 according to this transformation. However, one should not forget that vector w 2 was designed to avoid the natural degeneracy of astrometric solution between (Ω, ω) and (Ω + π, ω + π). It can be seen from Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> that changing (Ω, ω) to (Ω + π, ω + π) is equivalent to changing (i , ω ) to (π − i , −ω ) while leaving Ω unchanged. This transformation leaves the first two components of e X and e Y unchanged (this explains the degeneracy of the projected orbit), as well as the third component of e Z , all remaining components being changed to their opposites. The new parameter vector must remain unchanged with this transformation as well, to avoid convergence difficulties. We chose the following new parameter vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">w 3 = sin i cos Ω , sin i sin Ω , q sin i cos ω , q cos i sin ω , e, s 0 .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>This new vector is invariant in the transformation (i , ω ) −→ (π − i , −ω ). Its first two components define e X unambiguously. Its third and fourth components vanish when q = 0, i.e., when ω is undefined, which avoids singularities. Now, this vector can be expressed as a function of the original angles (i, Ω, ω) directly, so that the formal introduction of the new angles (i , Ω , ω ) is unnecessary. The same vector can be written</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">w 3 =       − cos ω sin Ω − sin ω cos i cos Ω,</formula><p>cos ω cos Ω − sin ω cos i sin Ω,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">q cos i, q cos ω sin ω sin 2 i 1 − sin 2 i sin 2 ω , e, s 0        .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>It can be checked that this vector is invariant in the transformation (Ω, ω) −→ (Ω + π, ω + π). This will be our parameter vector for a second version of the MCMC code. The new Jacobian of the transformation from (ln q, e, sin i, Ω, ω, t p ) to w 3 reads now</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">J 3 = q 2 sin 2 i sin 2 ω 1 − sin 2 i sin 2 ω ds dt .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>This new version succeeded in reaching convergence for PZ Tel B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Implementation</head><p>The two versions of our code have been written in Fortran 90, with an additional OPEN-MP parallel treatment of the computed Markov chains. Our basic strategy is the same is in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>. We first perform a least-square Levenberg-Marquardt fit of the orbit. This takes only a few seconds to converge towards a local χ 2 minimum. Of course, this fit is made starting from a rough orbit guess. The same procedure is re-initiated many times varying the starting orbit. This allows to probe the variety of local χ 2 minima. In all cases described below, among various minima, a main one, or a series of very similar ones was reached. This main minimum was selected as a starting point for the MCMC chains. This procedure turns out to speed up the convergence of the chains. This starting point is marked as red bars and black stars in the resulting MCMC posterior plots (see below). We also tried to run the MCMC starting from a random guess instead, and checked that the same posterior distributions were reached, but slower. We also checked in the posterior χ 2 distributions derived from the runs that in all cases, the starting point initially derived with Levenberg-Marquardt actually achieves the best χ 2 in the distribution. Strictly speaking, Levenberg-Marquardt works well to quickly derive the best χ 2 minimum. This shows that using other least-square fitting algorithms like downhill simplex for instance would not lead to a better result, as all these methods aim at finding a χ 2 minimum, possibly the best one. However, MCMC runs reveal afterwards that with sparsely sampled orbits as we are dealing with here, the very best χ 2 minimum does not always correspond to a probability peak in the posterior distributions. This intrinsic fact is independent from the method used to get the minimum. The implementation of the universal variable formalism described above requires an efficient algorithm to compute the Stumpff functions. The series (9) defining them efficiently converge only for sufficiently small x. We use a reduction algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Danby (1987)</ref>, that makes use of the following set of formulas</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">c 0 (4x) = 2 [c 0 (x)] 2 , c 1 (4x) = c 0 (x)c 1 (x),<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_23">c 2 (4x) = 1 2 [c 2 (x)] 2 , c 3 (4x) = 1 4 c 2 (x) + 1 4 c 0 (x)c 3 (x) .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Any input argument x is first reduced by successive factors of 4 until it satisfies |x| &lt; 0.1.

We do it with Newton's quartic method or with Laguerre-Conway's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Danby 1987)</ref>. To compute the derivatives of the Stumpff function, we use the following relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">dc n (x) dx = 1 2x c n 1 (x) − nc n (x) ,<label>(24)</label></formula><p>or equivalently, if we define φ n (α, s) = s n c n (αs 2 ), ∂φ n (α, s) ∂s</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">= φ n−1 (α, s) .<label>(25)</label></formula><p>For the special case n = 0, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">∂φ o (α, s) ∂s = −αφ 1 (α, s) .<label>(26)</label></formula><p>The same algorithm is implemented in the symplectic N-body integrator Swift ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Levison &amp; Duncan 1994)</ref> for high eccentricity orbits. Its use turns out to be only a few times (3-4) more computing time consuming than that of a standard Keplerian formalism based on sine and cosine functions. But this is worth applying it in MCMC to the case of very high eccentricity and open orbits, as the use of the universal Kepler's equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(8)</ref> eliminates the instabilities due to the permanent switch between the various formulas (3). Thus Markov chains converge more efficiently. We also had to fix an arbitrary upper limit e max = 4 for the eccentricity to ensure convergence. Setting larger e max values results in more steps needed to reach convergence, but the assumed e max = 4 upper limit as some physical justification. A large eccentricity means that Fomalhaut b is a passing by object that is currently encountering a flyby in the Fomalhaut system. The eccentricity of a flyby orbit cannot be arbitrarily large. For an hyperbolic orbit, the eccentricity is directly linked to the relative velocity at infinity v ∞ by the energy balance equation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results for Fomalhaut b</head><formula xml:id="formula_28">1 2 v 2 ∞ = GM(e − 1) q .<label>(27)</label></formula><p>An upper limit to v ∞ can be given considering a typical dispersion velocity in the solar neighborhood, i.e., ∼ 20 km s −1 . Assuming q = 25 AU, i.e., the most probable value for hyperbolic orbits in our distribution (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>), this immediately translates into an estimate of an upper limit for the eccentricity e max 4. The global statistics of the posterior orbital distribution obtained from the run is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, where distribution histograms for all individual elements (q, e, i, Ω, ω, t p ) as well as density maps for all combinations of them are represented. Special enlargements of the plots concerning e and Ω are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. In all histogram (mono-dimensional) plots, the red vertical bar superimposed to the plot shows the corresponding value for the best fit (lowest χ 2 ) orbit obtained independently via a least-square Levenberg-Marquardt procedure. The same orbital solution is marked with black stars in all off-diagonal density plots combining two orbital parameters. As explained above, a least-square fit is initiated prior to launching MCMC. The resulting best-fit model is then used as a starting point for the Markov chains, and posterior χ 2 distributions show that this solution actually achieves the minimum of the distribution.</p><p>We first compare these plots to the corresponding ones in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>, where the fit was made over the same data set, but limited to bound orbits only. The first striking fact is that the eccentricity distribution extends now beyond e = 1 well into the unbound regime. This shows as suspected that unbound orbital solutions for Fomalhaut b do exist. The best fit solution is itself an unbound orbit with e 1.9. We nevertheless note a strong peak in the distribution at e 0.94 that appears exactly at the same place as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>. This clearly shows that for such a weakly constrained problem, MCMC is definitely superior to least-square.</p><p>In fact, the whole eccentricity distribution below e &lt; ∼ 0.96 exactly matches the corresponding one in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>. This shows up in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> where the eccentricity histogram was intentionally cut at e = 1.5 to permit a better comparison. This first validates the present run (as the previous one was done with another code), and second shows that the cutoff at e 0.98 that appeared in the previous distribution was not physical, but rather due to the intrinsic limitation of the code used. The tail of the distribution extends now in the unbound regime up to the e max = 4 limitation that was fixed in the run. The shape of this tail can be fitted as with a e −3/2 power law. We also note <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref> that the periastron distribution closely matches that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>, while extending further out towards larger values. This is clearly due to the contribution of unbound orbits, as can be seen in the q-e probability map.</p><p>From this we can derive an estimate of the probability for Fomalhaut b's orbit to be bound, just counting the number of bound orbits in the whole set. We find p bound = 0.23. This probability actually depends on the assumed limitation e max = 4. If we had let the eccentricity to take larger values, the number of unbound orbits in the whole set would have been larger, and subsequently p bound would have been smaller. It is nevertheless possible to estimate the ultimate p bound value that would be derived if <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Examples of orbital solutions for Fomalhaut b, in projection onto the sky plane. The star is at the center of the plot. The black square denotes the location of the observed astrometric points. Various colours are given to the orbits to allow to distinguish them easily from each other we put no upper limit on the eccentricity. Taking into account the fact that the tail of the posterior eccentricity distribution roughly falls off as e −3/2 , we can extrapolate the distribution up to infinity, integrate it and reintroduce the missing orbits corresponding to e &gt; 4 into the distribution. Our posterior sample of orbits contains 10 6 solutions. Extrapolating the distribution we can estimate that ∼ 2.1 × 10 5 corresponding to e &gt; 4 are missing in our sample. This changes our probability estimate to p bound = 0.19, which can be considered as a minimum value. However, as the e max = 4 threshold results from a physical consideration (see above), the first derived p bound value can be regarded as robust. Note also that it is not very much above the minimum value. This shows that the contribution of very high eccentricity solutions is minor.</p><p>This probability is however just derived from a pure mathematical analysis without any likelihood consideration. Flybys are rare but not necessarily improbable (see example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Reche et al. 2009)</ref>. Looking now at the distributions of the other orbital elements, we see in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> that the location of the orbit in (Ω, i) still closely matches that of the observed dust disk (the white star in the plot) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kalas et al. 2005</ref>), like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>. In other works, there is still a strong suspicion of near-coplanarity between Fomalhaut b and the dust disk. This clearly favours a bound configuration rather than a flyby that would have no reason for being coplanar. Another possibility is that Fomalhaut b is just getting ejected today from the system. That last configuration nevertheless appears improbable regardless to the timescale of the ejection (∼ 1000 yrs) compared to the age of the system (440 Myrs Mamajek 2012). To conclude, these plausibility considerations combined with our p bound 0.23 estimate and the clear peak of the eccentricity distribution at e = 0.94 enable us to stress that Fomalhaut b is probably bound to the central star.</p><p>The situation is less clear with the argument of periastron. In the ω-e plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>, we see that depending on whether e &lt; 1 or e &gt; 1, the solutions exhibit different ω values. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>, we noted that the observed dust disk corresponds to ω disk = −148.9 • . This sill roughly matches the ω values for bound orbits, i.e., bound orbits are still apsidally aligned with the disk with a few tens of degrees.</p><p>The distribution of the time of periastron passage (t p ) is similar to that ofBeust et al. <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>, expect that we have here an additional tail after 1950 that corresponds to unbound orbits. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows finally a few orbital solution in projection onto the sky plane, with bound and unbound configurations. We note that all solutions fit the observed positions, while assuming very different shapes. We clearly see here the effect of the bad observational orbital coverage.</p></div>

These orbital determinations were performed assuming a bound orbit, so that no test at e ≥ 1 was done. This assumption is however questionable given the orbital solutions found. We thus ran our universal variable MCMC code <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.

As explained above (Sect. 2), we used the second version of the code with parameter vector w 3 (Eq. 19) that ensures a better convergence. Even in that case, convergence was hard to reach. 10 chains were run in parallel. After 1.5×10 10 steps, the Gelman-Rubin parameterˆRrameterˆ rameterˆR values for the 6 variables in w 3 were ranging between 1.006 and 1.019, while thê</p><p>T parameter values were ranging between 260 and 800. The run was stopped there to save computing time, as reaching the demanded criteria ( ˆ R &lt; 1.01 andˆTandˆ andˆT &gt; 1000 for all variables) would have demanded many more steps. ThêThê R andˆTandˆ andˆT values reached at the stopping point must nevertheless be considered as characteristic for an already very good convergence, so that we may trust the resulting posterior distribution. We checked indeed that posterior distributions that we could derive stopping the computation earlier, i.e. at a point when thêthê R andˆTandˆ andˆT values were somewhat further away from convergence criteria, did not show significant differences with those presented below. Noticeably, nothing comparable in terms of convergence criteria was reached using the first version of the code using parameter vector w 2 (Eq. 13).</p><p>The global statistics of the posterior orbital distribution obtained from the run is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, which was built with the same plotting conventions as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> for Fomalhaut b. In particular the red bar and the black star indicate the best fit orbit obtained via Levenberg-Marquardt. Special enlargements concerning the periastron and the eccentricity are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>The most striking feature that shows up is the eccentricity distribution. As expected, PZ Tel B's orbit appears extremely eccentric, but the eccentricity distribution is drastically different from that of Fomalhaut b. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pearce et al. (2015)</ref>, the temporal coverage of Fomalhaut b's orbit is so small that what is measured is basically a projected position and a projected velocity, with no information about position and velocity along the line of sight. Consequently, solutions with arbitrarily high eccentricities are mathematically possible. This is not the case for PZ Tel B. Table 2 shows that the motion followed over 5 years is quasi linear, but with a separation with the central star that increased by more than 60%. Even if the orbital coverage is still small (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>), this is more than just a projected position and project velocity measurement. Consequently, no tail extending to arbitrarily large values is obtained with MCMC. All solutions naturally concentrate in the range 0.91 &lt; e &lt; 1.23. The eccentricity distribution appears extremely concentrated around e = 1. The enlargement in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> close to e = 1 reveals a peak near e = 1.00. The median of the distribution is at e = 1.001275; 67% and 95% confidence levels are 0.965 &lt; e &lt; 1.024 and 0.906 &lt; e &lt; 1.157 respectively. We compare the eccentricity distribution to that recently found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ginski et al. (2014)</ref>, who derived 0.622 &lt; e &lt; 0.9991 using a LSMC (Least-squares Monte-Carlo) approach, bur restricted to bound orbits. Of course our distribution now extends beyond e = 1, but our lower bound (e = 0.91) is significantly larger than theirs. This is due to our additional data points rather than to the method used.</p><p>The periastron distribution shows a sharp peak around q = 0.07 AU. The q-e map <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4</ref>) reveals actually two branches of solutions, one with bound solution and one with unbound solutions. But most solutions concentrate close to e = 1 and q = 0.07 AU. The inclination shows a peak at i = 98 • . This corresponds to a nearly edge-on configuration, and could explain the quasi-linear motion. But solutions up to i = 150 • are also possible. The i-e map shows that the larger inclination solutions actually corresponds to those with e 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Discussion</head><p>The exact nature of PZ Tel B's orbit around PZ Tel is still controversial. Our orbital analysis shows that both bound or unbound solutions are valid, but that the eccentricity distribution is strongly peaked around e = 1. If PZ Tel B is unbound to PZ Tel, it could be a passing by object (a flyby). This is hard to believe given the very small periastron value, and also considering the fact that both the star and the companion seem to <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Enlargement of histograms and density maps out of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> for the periastron (q) and eccentricity (e) parameters. With respect to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, the periastron plot (left) was truncated at q = 1 AU to make the peak at q = 0.07 appear. The right plot is a special zoom of the eccentricity distribution around e = 1. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.

The star is at the center of the plot. The data points appear in the upper left corner of the plot. As in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, colours are given to individual orbits to allow them to be distinguished from each other. be young objects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schmidt et al. 2014</ref>). This cannot however be ruled out mathematically. From Eq. (27) with M = 1.25 M and v ∞ = 20 km s −1 , we derive e = 1.012 for q = 0.07 AU and e = 1.181 for q = 1 AU, which is still in the tail of the eccentricity distribution, although not in the main peak. We nevertheless think this possibility to be very unlikely.</p><p>Still if PZ Tel B is unbound, it could be an escaping companion that was recently ejected by some gravitational perturbation. Two problems arise with this hypothesis. First, the ejection must have occurred very recently (a few years ago). Given the age of the star <ref type="bibr">(23 Myr Mamajek &amp; Bell 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Binks &amp; Jeffries 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Malo et al. 2014</ref>), the probability of witnessing such an event right today is very low, about ∼ 10 −6 if we consider the timescale of the ejection (∼ 10 yrs) and the fact that such an ejection should not occur more than a few times in the history of the system. Second, to efficiently perturb a 40 M Jup companion, an additional object of comparable mass (at least) is required. As of yet, no such additional companion has been detected.</p><p>So, PZ Tel B is presumably a bound companion. Then one must explain its extremely high eccentricity. It could result from secular perturbation processes such as the Kozai-Lidov mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kozai 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krymolowski &amp; Mazeh 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ford et al. 2000)</ref>. This is a likely mechanism for generating very high eccentricities. But here again, given the fairly high mass of PZ Tel B, this would require a more massive outer companion that would probably have been already discovered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Hidden inner companions ?</head><p>6.1. Fomalhaut b <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> argue that imaged substellar companions that appear very eccentric with a first order orbital fit could actually be much less eccentric due to the presence of an unseen inner companion. The reason is that the measured astrometry is necessarily relative to the central star, while in the presence of a massive enough inner companion, the Keplerian motion of the imaged body should be considered around the center of mass of the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> develop a full analytic study showing how the presence of such an unseen companion could artificially enhance the fitted eccentricity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> present a detailed study dedicated to the case of Fomalhaut b, concluding that in any case, Fomalhaut b must be significantly eccentric. According to them, in the best realistic configuration, a ∼ 12M Jup companion orbiting Fomalhaut at 10 AU could account for a ∼ 10% overestimate of Fomalhaut b's orbital eccentricity. This would for instance shift the eccentricity peak from e = 0.94 to e = 0.85. This possibility cannot be ruled out until the inner configuration of Fomalhaut's planetary system remains unconstrained. It would also be compatible with the scenario outlined by <ref type="bibr">Faramaz et al. (2015)</ref> to explain the origin of Fomalhaut b's eccentricity. According to this model, Fomalhaut b should have formerly resided at ∼ 60 AU in the 5:2 mean-motion resonance with another Jupiter-sized planet (termed Fomalhaut c) located at ∼ 100 AU. Then, due to the resonant action, its eccentricity would have increased, and it would have been ejected towards its present-day orbit. This is still compatible with the hypothetical presence of another massive planet orbiting inside at 10 AU. The only difficulty is that with e = 0.85, Fomalhaut b's periastron is still as low as ∼ 18 AU, which is still close enough to 10 AU to raise the question of its orbital stability versus perturbations by the hidden companion. However, according to <ref type="bibr">Faramaz et al. (2015)</ref>'s scenario, Fomalhaut b's orbit must already cross today that of the putative Fomalhaut c planet orbiting at 100 AU. So in any case, Fomalhaut b must lie today on a metastable orbit. Adding another massive body deep inside the system does not change this conclusion. Consequently, the presence of an additional massive planet orbiting Fomalhaut at 10 AU that would artificially enhance Fomalhaut b's eccentricity by ∼ 10% cannot be ruled out, as being still compatible with all observational constraints. Moreover it does not affect the dynamical scenario of <ref type="bibr">Faramaz et al. (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">PZ Tel B</head><p>The case of PZ Tel B is more complex. The main difference with Fomalhaut b is that it is imaged over a more significant part of its orbit. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pearce et al. (2015)</ref>, the detected astrometric motion of Fomalhaut b is basically compatible with a straight line at constant speed, so that what is measured is not much more than a projected position and a projected velocity. This is not the case for PZ Tel B, as the projected distance to the star is already able to vary significantly over the observation period <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. This is actually the reason why the fitted eccentricity distribution does not extend towards arbitrarily large values <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Consequently, an analytic study of the potential effect of an unseen companion on the fitted orbit is less easy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> nevertheless calculated that a companion at least as massive as 130 M Jup orbiting PZ Tel at 5.5 AU is required to mimic PZ Tel B's eccentricity. But recent imaging by Ginski  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Astrometric positions of PZ Tel B relative to the center of mass of the PZ Tel -PZ Tel c system, computed from the data of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and with PZ Tel c's characteristics taken from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> Obs However, as for Fomalhaut b, an unseen companion could account only partially for PZ Tel B's eccentricity. We decided to perform an automated search based on this idea. Our strategy is the following: We arbitrarily fix the characteristics of an unseen companion (mass and orbit) that we may call PZ Tel c. Given these characteristics, we calculate at each time the expected position of the center of mass of the system, and recompute the astrometric positions of PZ Tel B relative to this center of mass. Then we restart a least-square fit and check the eccentricity of the best χ 2 solution obtained. This process is then automatically re-initiated many times, changing the characteristics of PZ Tel c until a solution yielding a least-square fit with the minimal eccentricity is found. Of course we do several attempts, varying the starting points. They showed that in any case, PZ Tel B's eccentricity of the best χ 2 solution never gets below ∼ 0.7.</p><p>For these most favourable configuration, the MCMC fit is re-launched to derive the statistical distributions of orbits. We present here one of these runs. The characteristics of the putative PZ Tel c corresponding to this run are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and the recomputed barycentric astrometry of PZ Tel B is given in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. The main characteristics of the result of the run (histograms of periastron, eccentricity and inclination) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 8</ref>. The first thing we note is that the putative PZ Tel c companion (12 M Jup at 3.5 AU) is compatible with the current non-detection limits ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ginski et al. 2014</ref>). Second, the difference between the computed barycentric astrometric data and the measured data is small, often within the error bars of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. Nonetheless, the difference in the orbital fit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 8)</ref> is striking. PZ Tel B still appears eccentric, but its eccentricity is now confined between 0.65 and 0.8, the best χ 2 orbit (the red bar in the plots) having e 0.68. According to this analysis, PZ Tel B would clearly be a bound companion. Its periastron q ranges between 8 and 24 AU, but it must be noted that all orbits with q &lt; 8 AU have been eliminated in the fitting procedure as being presumably highly unstable versus gravitational perturbations from the hypothetical PZ Tel ccompanion. Letting the periastron distribution extend towards lower values would generate solutions with larger eccentricities, but these would probably not be physical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Dynamical analysis</head><p>Figure 8 also reveals that PZ Tel B's orbital inclination is very close to 90 • , meaning an almost edge-on viewed orbit. Simultaneously, PZ Tel c's inclination appears extremely low <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>, meaning a pole-on orbit. This allows to question the dynamical stability of such a system. According to our fit, PZ Tel B's periastron is most probably around ∼ 10 AU, which is ∼ 3 times larger than the semi-major axis of PZ Tel c's semi-major axis. This is in principle marginally enough to ensure the dynamical stability of the whole. But here both orbits are nearly perpendicular. In this context, the inner orbit is likely to be trapped in the Kozai-Lidov mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kozai 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krymolowski &amp; Mazeh 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ford et al. 2000</ref>) characterized by huge eccentricity changes. This could trigger orbital instability.</p><p>We thus decided to numerically investigate the dynamical stability of this three body system, starting from the best χ 2 solution for PZ Tel B in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 8</ref>, and with the orbital solution from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. As the fitted orbit of PZ Tel B is barycentric, we used our HJS symplectic code <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beust 2003</ref>) that naturally works in Jacobi coordinates, which is the case here. The result is presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, which shows the orbital evolution of the system over 10 6 yr. The regular evolution pattern is an indication of stability. In fact, the integration was carried out up to 10 7 yr, which reveals the same behaviour as in the first 10 6 yr. Moreover, the semi-major axes of both planets (not shown here) appeared to be remarkably stable, which confirms the stability. Nonetheless, PZ Tel c's eccentricity exhibits large amplitude oscillations couple with oscillation of the mutual inclination between both orbital planes. This behaviour is characteristic for a strong Kozai resonance. It must be noted however that in high eccentricity phases, the mutual inclination does not drop down to 0 but up towards 180 • (retrograde orbits). This is thus an example of retrograde Kozai resonance.</p><p>This picture is however very probably erroneous. In fact, given the almost perfectly perpendicular initial configuration of the orbits, the Kozai cycles drive PZ Tel c up to very high eccentricity values. The peak eccentricity in the cycles is actually close to ∼ 0.998 ! Considering that PZ Tel c's semi-major axis is nearly constant, its periastron must drop down to very small values during peak eccentricity phases. The right plot of <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> confirms this fact. The minimum periastron value in the peaks ranges between 10 4 AU and 10 −3 AU. With a mass of 1.25 M , PZ Tel's radius can be estimated to 9 × 10 5 km, i.e, 6 × 10 −3 AU. PZ Tel c is thus potentially subject to collision with the central star. However, when the periastron decreases in high eccentricity phases, PZ Tel c is very probably affected by tides with the central star that may prevent physical collisions. Tides were not taken into account in the run described in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, so that this picture does not hold.</p><p>We thus re-computed the secular evolution of the same threebody system, but taking now tides between the central star and PZ Tel c into account. The computation was done using a special version of the HJS integrator to which we have added tides and relativistic post-Newtonian corrections. The details of this code are presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beust et al. (2012)</ref>, with an application to the GJ 436 system. Tides mainly depend of the assumed tidal dissipation parameter Q p for the planet, a dimensionless parameter related to the rate of energy dissipated through tides per orbital period <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barker &amp; Ogilvie 2009</ref>). The smaller Q p , the more efficient the tidal dissipation is. Q p is very hard to estimate, but typical values for giant planets range around 10 5 within one order or magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Zhang &amp; Hamilton 2008)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the result of such a simulation assuming Q p = 10 5 for PZ Tel c. The difference with the previous run is striking. PZ Tel c's semi-major axis appears to remain constant for ∼ 3 × 10 4 ,yr and to suddenly drop after. During the first phase (before 3 × 10 4 yr), the eccentricity gradually increases before decreasing, and the mutual inclination decreases before stabilising. The explanation is the following: in the first phase, the periastron remains too large to allow tides to be active. But the Kozai mechanism causes an eccentricity increase until a point where tides act at periastron. The subsequent energy dissipation causes then a rapid decay of PZ Tel c's orbit and a subsequent circularisation. This scenario is actually similar to the one depicted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beust et al. (2012)</ref> for GJ 436 and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine (2007)</ref>. In the latter cases, several KozaiLidov oscillations together with tidal friction first occur before the inner orbit starts to decay. Here this state is reached at the very first eccentricity peak, thanks to very strong tides when the periastron gets very close to the stellar surface.</p><p>The consequence is that tides prevent the deduced orbital configuration between PZ Tel B and PZ Tel c from being stable, as the hypothetical PZ Tel c inevitably migrates to a much closer orbit after only 3 × 10 4 yr. This result obviously depends on the assumed Q p value. We thus tried other runs with increased Q p values (10 6 and above) to reduce the strength of tides. This appeared to only delay the time of the orbital decay without changing the basic scenario. In any case, PZ Tel c ends up on a tight <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.

We are thus back to our conclusion that PZ Tel B's orbit is really very close to parabolic state, as deduced from our initial MCMC analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We have developed a new MCMC code based on the use of universal Keplerian variables, dedicated to the orbital fit of imaged companions with very high eccentricities or unbound orbits. This code was successfully applied to the specific cases of Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Concerning Fomalhaut b, we confirm our orbital determination of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beust et al. (2014)</ref>, but we show that the eccentricity distribution can extend above e = 1 in the unbound regime. This is in agreement with the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pearce et al. (2015)</ref> who show that for such companions imaged over a very small orbital arc, the unknown radial velocity renders unbound orbits possible. We think however that Fomalhaut b is very probably a bound companion, although very eccentric. The case of PZ Tel B is more complex. Our code reveals a very different eccentricity distribution than for Fomalhaut b. PZ Tel B's eccentric distribution exhibits indeed a very sharp peak around e = 1.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref>, imaged companions can appear much more eccentric than they are actually, thanks to the presence of hidden inner companions that affect that astrometric data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pearce et al. (2014)</ref> already showed that this model cannot account for Fomalhaut b's eccentricity. Concerning PZ Tel B, we show that a hidden∼ 12 M Jup companion orbiting at ∼ 3.5 AU in a pole-on configuration (contrary to the edge-on orbit of PZ Tel B) could mimic an almost unbound orbit despite a real eccentricity around ∼ 0.7. However, due to the combination of tides and Kozai-Lidov mechanism, this configuration is dynamically unstable. We are thus back to the conclusion that PZ Tel B is really a very high eccentricity, possible unbound companion.</p><p>The dynamical origin of Fomalhaut b and its configuration relative to the dust disk orbiting Fomalhaut was recently investigated by <ref type="bibr">Faramaz et al. (2015)</ref>. According to this model, the Fomalhaut system should harbour another, more massive planet that controls the shape of the disk. Fomalhaut b could have formerly resided in a mean-motion resonance with that planet have been put on its present day eccentricity via a gradual eccentricity increase and one or several close encounters. The case of PZ Tel B is more complex. According to our orbital determination, its eccentricity is in any case very close to 1 if not above. The planet passed through a very close (&lt; 0.1 AU) periastron in 2002, consistent with its non-detection in 2003 NaCo images ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Masciadri et al. 2005</ref>). Highly eccentric orbits with very small periastron are usually triggered by Kozai-Lidov mechanism or by mean-motion resonance with a moderately eccentric outer companion (such an for instance in the so-called Falling Evaporating Body scenario in the β Pictoris system <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beust &amp; Morbidelli 2000)</ref>. But given the estimated mass of PZ Tel B, this would require a perturbing companion in the low stellar mass regime. Such a companion would have already been detected. Apart from a very peculiar past encounter event, there is therefore no obvious explanation for the unusual orbital configuration of PZ Tel B. Further monitoring of this system will help better understanding it.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fomalhaut b is known to have a very eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity in any case &gt; ∼ 0 .</head><label>0</label><figDesc>5 and most probably around 0.8- 0.9 (Beust et al. 2014; Pearce et al. 2015). Whether it is actually bound to the central star may be questionable, especially due to the very small coverage fraction of its orbit. If bound, its orbital period is a matter of hundreds of years if not more, while the four available astrometric points span over a period of 8 years only. Therefore, as noted by Pearce et al. (2015), what is mea- sured is basically a projected position and a projected velocity onto the sky plane, so that the z-coordinates (i.e., along the line of sight) of the position an velocity are unknown. As a matter of fact, Pearce et al. (2015) use with these data a simple sampling method drawing random z-coordinates for the position on ve- locity. They find an eccentricity distribution very similar to that derived in Beust et al. (2014) with MCMC. However, in both cases, the orbit was supposed to be bound. The eccentricity dis- tribution of Pearce et al. (2015) nevertheless extends up to e = 1 (that of Beust et al. (2014) stops at e 0.98), showing that un- bound solutions could exist as well. This justifies the use of our new code to check this possibility. The code in its first version (see above) was used with the available astrometric data from Kalas et al. (2013) and listed in Beust et al. (2014). Following the prescriptions by Ford (2006), 10 chains were run in parallel until the Gelman-Rubin parame- tersˆRtersˆ tersˆR andˆTandˆ andˆT reach repeatedly convergence criteria for all param- eters in Eq. (13), i.e., ˆ R &lt; 1.01 andˆTandˆ andˆT &gt; 1000. We had already used the same procedure in Chauvin et al. (2012) and Beust et al. (2014). In Beust et al. (2014), this convergence criteria were reached after 6.2 × 10 7 steps. Here it took 4.25 × 10 8 steps with the universal variable code, running on the same data. This il- lustrates how the possibility for Markov chains to extend in the unbound orbit domain increases the complexity of the problem.</figDesc></figure>
