				<p>Some recently discovered short-period Earth to Neptune sized exoplanets (super Earths) have low observed mean densities which can only be explained by voluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the conditions allowing the accretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass) following the disk&apos;s dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the underlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles than the core (equivalently, lighter than a few % of the planet&apos;s mass) can be blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the mass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres, while not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion and become gas giants (Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed super-Earth population and find that low-density planets are indeed concentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive model can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In recent years, the Kepler mission has discovered many Earth to Neptune size exoplanets (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014</ref>). Some of these "super Earths", or "mini Neptunes", have low densities which rule out a purely rocky composition. The low density can be explained by either a gaseous Hydrogen/Helium envelope atop a rocky core, or by a water rich composition. However, at least some super Earths have densities low enough, that a gaseous atmosphere is essential to explain their inferred masses and radii ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lissauer et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The existence of significant gaseous envelopes surrounding rocky cores fits in naturally in the context of core-nucleated accretion theory. According to this theory, gas giants such as Jupiter formed by gas accretion onto solid cores from the gas-rich nebula which surrounded the young sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Perri &amp; Cameron 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr">Har- ris 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mizuno et al. 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mizuno 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Stevenson 1982)</ref>. The rate by which a rocky core accumulates gas is determined by the atmosphere's cooling rate (KelvinHelmholtz contraction), until the acquired atmosphere is comparable in mass to the core, at which stage a runaway accretion initiates and the planet explodes into a gas giant <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee &amp; Chi- ang 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Piso et al. 2015</ref>). The amount of gas a rocky core embedded in the protoplanetary gas nebula acquires <ref type="bibr">1</ref>  (and whether it will explode into a gas giant) is therefore determined by comparing the atmosphere's cooling timescale to the gas disk lifetime (a few Myr; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mamajek 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Williams &amp; Cieza 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexander et al. 2014</ref>). In some cases, however, the assembly of the rocky core cannot be decoupled from the accretion of gas, and the effects of planetesimal impacts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov , 2011</ref>), or even giant collisions of protoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref>, have to be taken into account, depending on the orbital separation from the parent star.</p><p>In this work we focus on super Earths in close orbits of ∼ 0.1 AU, with the Kepler-11 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>) as a well-studied example. At least some of these planets require Hydrogen/Helium envelopes which constitute ∼ 1% to 10% of the planet's mass to explain the observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>). While some works argue that such heavy atmospheres are difficult to accrete in-situ during the gas disk's lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015</ref>), other works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014</ref>) raise the opposite concern, that accretion is too efficient, making super Earths vulnerable to runaway and becoming gas giants. Nonetheless, by examining the atmosphere mass growth with time in both <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Inam- dar &amp; Schlichting (2015)</ref>, we find that rocky cores of a few M ⊕ acquire gas envelopes of a few % during a disk lifetime of a few Myr, at least for some plausible nebula parameters, and disregarding the effects of giant impacts (perhaps due to inward migration of an assembled core during the disk lifetime, or a solid-enhanced nebula). Therefore, low density planets with such masses are a natural "missing link" between smaller rocky planets, which did not manage to accrete a substantial atmosphere, and more massive cores (a fiducial critical value of ≈ 10M ⊕ is often cited; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014</ref>), which gathered their own mass in gas, and exploded into gas giants.</p><p>Although super Earths with gas envelopes of a few % are a plausible outcome of nebular gas accretion, their evolution continues after the disk dispersal. In particular, many studies have demonstrated that these gas envelopes are susceptible to significant evaporation and mass loss due to high-energy stellar photons once the nebula has dispersed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Owen &amp; Jack- son 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In this work we emphasize the role of the planet's cooling luminosity as an additional energy source for driving mass loss (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ikoma &amp; Hori 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2016)</ref>, and relate the post-dispersal evolution to the preceding accretion, in order to obtain constraints on the possible formation scenarios of these planets. By selfconsistently coupling the nebular accretion to the subsequent mass-loss once the nebula has dispersed (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rogers et al. 2011</ref>), we find limiting conditions in which super Earths can acquire and hold on to their atmospheres.</p><p>The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the accretion of gas from the nebula. In Section 3 we study the subsequent evolution once the gas nebula has dispersed. Section 4 is devoted to atmosphere evaporation by high-energy photons, and to how it sculpts the super-Earth population. Section 5 compares our theoretical constraints to the observations, and our conclusions are summarized in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">NEBULAR GAS ACCRETION</head><p>Gas accretion by rocky cores has been studied extensively, both numerically and analytically <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bodenheimer &amp; Pollack 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pollack et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bodenheimer &amp; Lis- sauer 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Piso et al. 2015</ref>). Here, we briefly summarize the main concepts outlined in these works, and provide a simplified analytical description of nebular gas accretion. Since our main goal is to provide intuition for the subsequent phases of planetary evolution, we adopt many simplifying assumptions in comparison with previous studies.</p><p>The formation timescale of a rocky protoplanet is much shorter than the gas nebula lifetime in the inner disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goldreich et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014</ref>), leading us to ignore the impact of planetesimals during gas accretion. However, the isolation mass of a protoplanet is also small in the inner disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goldreich et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">), leading Inamdar &amp; Schlichting (2015</ref> to consider giant impacts of protoplanets, once the gas has begun to disperse. Here, we ignore giant impacts and assume that gas accumulates onto an assembled rocky core (which may have migrated from larger distances, or created in a solid-enhanced nebula).</p><p>Throughout the paper, we assume that the self gravity of the atmosphere is negligible. Naively, when this condition breaks down runaway accretion occurs, leading to the formation of gas giants, which are not the focus of this work. More concretely, by inspecting <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin (2014)</ref>, we find that self-gravity affects the results by more than a factor of 2 for atmosphere mass fractions as low as 20%, which are at the high end of the gas envelopes that we consider. For these atmospheres, our approximation is marginal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Adiabatic Atmosphere</head><p>The initial atmosphere a core of mass M c and radius R c accretes, in a short (dynamical) timescale, is given by an adiabatic profile, which did not have time to cool, and has the same entropy as the surrounding nebula. Hydrostatic equilibrium sets the following adiabatic temperature profile (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref> T (r)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T eq = 1 + R B r − R B r out ≈    1 r = r out R B /r out r r out R B /r r r out ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where T eq ∼ 10 3 K is the temperature of the surrounding nebula, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R B = (1 − 1/γ)R B ∼ R B ,</formula><p>with R B GM c µ/k B T eq denoting the Bondi radius. G is the gravitation constant, k B is Boltzmann's constant, µ the molecular mass, and γ the adiabatic index, which we choose as γ = 7/5, suitable for diatomic gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Piso et al. (2015)</ref> incorporate more elaborate equations of state into their numerical calculations, in which γ varies with temperature and pressure. Nonetheless, we approximate here γ as constant for simplicity and discuss the sensitivity of the results to this choice below. r out = min(R B , R H ) denotes the radius where the planet's atmosphere blends in with the surrounding nebula, which is taken to be the minimum of the Bondi radius and the Hill radius R H = a(M c /M ) 1/3 , with a denoting the semi-major axis. For a few M ⊕ core at ∼ 0.1 AU, R B ≈ R H ∼ 10 10 cm, with less massive or more distant cores having R B &lt; R H (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rafikov 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref>. Note that the nebular scale height is z d = c s /Ω 10 10 cm, with c s (k B T eq /µ) 1/2 denoting the sound speed and Ω = (GM /a 3 ) 1/2 the orbital period (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hayashi 1981)</ref>. Therefore we may assume spherical accretion, although this assumption is marginal. The adiabatic density profile is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ(r) ρ d = 1 + R B r − R B r out 1/(γ−1) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ρ d = σ d /z d ∼ 10 −6 g cm −3</formula><p>denoting the disk density, assuming a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) surface density <ref type="bibr">1981)</ref>, although the Kepler planets might have formed in a more massive or solid-enhanced nebula <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schlichting 2014</ref>). By integrating Equation (2) we find that for γ &gt; 4/3 the mass fraction of the atmosphere is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">σ d ≈ 5·10 4 (T eq /10 3 K) 3 g cm −2 (Hayashi</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">f ≡ M atm M c ∼ ρ d r 3 out M c R B r out 1/(γ−1) ∼ 10 −3 ·          M c M ⊕ 2 T eq 10 3 K 5/2 R B &lt; R H M c M ⊕ 5/3 T eq 10 3 K 2 R B &gt; R H ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where we emphasize the transition between Bondi and Hill boundary conditions, at a few M ⊕ , and where the factor (R B /r out ) 1/(γ−1) is a correction to similar expressions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting (2015)</ref> for r out = R H , due to the density jump at r ≈ r out , evident in Equation (2). Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(3)</ref> shows that adiabatic gas accretion is insufficient and cannot explain observed envelope mass fractions without invoking a massive nebula (by 1-2 orders of magnitude; see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bodenheimer &amp; Lissauer 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref>. Equation (3) also indicates that the assembly of N small envelopes (especially in the r out = R B regime) into a large one during the giant collisions phase is inefficient (as N −2 ), even if we ignore mass loss due to collisions. The gas fraction for r out = R H ∼ R B (relevant for a few M ⊕ cores at ∼ 0.1 AU) can be written as (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f ∼ ρ d a 3 M ∼ Gσ d c s Ω ∼ Q −1 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where Q &gt; 1 is Toomre's stability criterion for the gas disk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin (2013)</ref> disregard the (R B /r out ) 1/(γ−1) factor in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(3)</ref>, leading to a constant f as a function of M c in the R B &gt; R H regime, and to their claim that Equation (4) represents the maximal gas fraction, in contrast to Equation (3) which predicts a further increase in f for larger core masses (R B &gt; R H ). Equation (4) demonstrates that cores a few times the mass of Earth can accrete arbitrarily large (up to runaway) adiabatic atmospheres, if embedded in a massive enough nebula (as invoked by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schlichting 2014</ref>). Nonetheless, we assume a light (MMSN, or more precisely, its extrapolation beyond Mercury's orbit) gas nebula, in which adiabatic atmospheres are small, as indicated by Equation (3), and further accretion by the cooling of the envelope has to be considered. In order to reconcile this gas-poor nebula with the Kepler observations (specifically, the high solid surface densities required to assemble large cores at close distances), it might be necessary to consider either a large solid/gas ratio or inward migration of rocky cores (Schlichting 2014).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Accretion by Cooling</head><p>As the gas envelope cools through radiation, an outer radiative layer develops, while the interior remains isentropic, due to convection (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>.

For r R rcb &lt; R B (we make a further approximation, and assume that the outer boundary condition is always dictated by R B )</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">k B T (r) ≈ γ − 1 γ GM c µ r ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>or intuitively, the scale height is h ∼ r (leading to a power law density profile), and specifically, the temperature at the atmosphere-core boundary</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">T (R c ) remains constant at k B T (R c ) ∼ GM c µ/R c , with R c ∼ 10 9 cm R B .</formula><p>At this temperature, the rocky core is molten, and is therefore convective. Since the core is convective (i.e. has a uniform entropy) and almost incompressible, we approximate it as isothermal. This simplification is in accordance with realistic adiabatic profiles, in which the temperature changes only by a factor of order unity, while the pressure varies by orders of magnitude (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Katsura et al. 2010</ref>). Because T (R c ) is constant, as explained above, core cooling plays no role in the energy budget as long as R c R rcb . The specific energy in the interior is therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">e = − GM c r + 1 γ − 1 k B T µ = − γ − 1 γ GM c r ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>implying that for γ &lt; 3/2 the total energy is concentrated in the inside, and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E = − γ − 1 γ γ − 1 3 − 2γ 4πR 2 c GM c ρ(R c ).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>According to Equation (10), as the envelope cools, its density increases, and therefore the radiative (and nearly isothermal) region thickens, as depicted schematically in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The total envelope mass, on the other hand, is concentrated in the outside of the convective region, r ∼ R rcb , for γ &gt; 4/3. By integrating Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(7)</ref> we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">M atm = A(γ)4πR 3 rcb ρ rcb R B R rcb 1/(γ−1) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where the numerical coefficient A(γ = 7/5) = 5π/16. The factor of (R B /R rcb ) 1/(γ−1) is due to the temperature and density jump at r ≈ R rcb (where the scale height is R 2 rcb /R B &lt; R rcb ). The mass in the radiative (nearly isothermal) region is negligible due to the exponentially decreasing density (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang (2015)</ref> argue for γ &lt; 4/3, due to H 2 dissociation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Piso et al. 2015)</ref>, and based on numerical calculations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. (2014)</ref>. For such values of γ, the mass is also concentrated in the inside (as the energy), and some of our results change. Nonetheless, we ignore Hydrogen dissociation here for simplicity, and present results for the diatomic γ = 7/5 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Piso &amp; Youdin 2014</ref>, for a similar model). Qualitative conclusions which are sensitive to our choice of γ &gt; 4/3 are discussed below, and the alternative solution for γ &lt; 4/3 is also provided.

The atmosphere mass in this approximation, using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, is given by M atm ≈ ρ rcb R 3 B , and by comparison with Equation (3) we find that the gas fraction f increases by a ratio of ρ rcb /ρ d relative to the adiabatic atmosphere. Since we are interested in atmospheres of a few % in mass, and adiabatic atmospheres have f ∼ 10 −3 , we deduce that ρ rcb /ρ d ∼ 10 1 − 10 2 , and R rcb decreases (from an initial R B ) by a factor of a few.

Specifically, we emphasize that the amount of accreted gas does not depend on the density of the nebula ρ d , except for logarithmic factors due to equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>, which we have neglected.

In this phase cooling is equivalent to shrinking, and it occurs on a timescale t/t disk = (R rcb /R B ) −2(3γ−4)/(γ−1) according to Equation (16), if M atm is constant. We emphasize that the shrinking radius of the RCB R rcb is a good approximation for the radius of the planet, since the scale height of the radiative layer is much smaller h/R rcb ∼ R rcb /R B &lt; 1. The above cooling timescale estimate is valid until R rcb ∼ R c , and our approximation of r R rcb in the inner envelope (see Section 2) breaks down. However, as we show in Section 3.2, thick envelopes shed part of their mass, and shrink to the thin regime on shorter timescales, so their cooling can be ignored. Before we discuss mass loss though, we analyze the structure of thin atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Thin Atmosphere</head><p>We now define R rcb more generally as R rcb ≡ R − R c , where R is the radius of the planet (or the RCB). This definition coincides with the previous one for the thick atmosphere regime R rcb R c , and allows us to study thin envelopes with R ∼ R c , or equivalently R rcb R c , which are observationally interesting ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>). For a thin atmosphere Equation (5) can be approximated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">T (r ) T rcb ≈ 1 + R B R 2 c r ≈ R B R 2 c r ,<label>(19)</label></formula><p>with r measuring the distance from the RCB (0 &lt; r &lt; R rcb ), and where we can ignore the thin isothermal layer of width r ∼ R 2 c /R B if the atmosphere is not ultra thin R rcb /R c &gt; R c /R B (ultra thin atmospheres of exoplanets are currently observationally irrelevant). Equation (19) immediately demonstrates a fundamental difference between the thin and thick regimes. A rocky core surrounded by a thick atmosphere does not cool, and stays at a constant temperature T /T rcb = R B /R c (see Section 2.2). A thin envelope, on the other hand, allows the rocky core beneath it to cool, and the core's temperature decreases as the atmosphere shrinks T /T rcb = R B R rcb /R 2 c . Therefore, in contrast to the thick regime, we expect the rocky core in the thin case to play a role in the energy budget of the cooling envelope, as we show below.</p><p>The density in the convective region is given by ρ(r )/ρ rcb = (T (r )/T rcb ) 1/(γ−1) .

For simplicity, we take γ c = 4/3, in accordance with the Dulong-Petit law. We see from Equation (21) that although the core is more massive than the envelope, it may contain fewer particles due to its larger molecular weight, and therefore may have a lower energy capacity. We note that Equation (21) assumes that the core remains molten, and therefore roughly isothermal. However, if the atmosphere is thin enough, the temperature at the atmosphere-core boundary decreases, and an insulating solid crust forms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Spontaneous Mass Loss</head><p>In previous sections we calculated the radius evolution of the planet after disk dispersal, assuming that the envelope mass remains constant. In particular, we found that the cooling time to envelope thickness R rcb is t ∝ R −1 rcb for R rcb &gt; R c (thick regime) and t ∝ R −5/2 rcb for R rcb &lt; R c (thin regime), assuming γ = 7/5. However, as we show below, mass loss is inherent to post-dispersal evolution. By comparing the mass-loss timescale and the cooling time, we find below that thick atmospheres are always governed by mass loss, while thin envelopes can be either mass-loss or cooling dominated, depending on their mass.</p><p>When the disk disperses, the gas density ρ d → 0. If the dispersal process is faster than the envelope cools, then according to Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>, we expect R rcb to decrease, while ρ rcb remains constant, since the energy does not change, and the energy of thick atmospheres is determined only by ρ rcb , not R rcb , as seen in Equation (10). Consequently, we expect the atmosphere to decrease in mass, according to Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, at least until the thin regime is reached. However, even if the loss of pressure support from the ambient disk (causing the mass loss) is immediate (see Section 3.3), the atmosphere adjusts itself to the changing boundary condition on a finite timescale.</p><p>A commonly used criterion to determine the mass loss rate is the energy limited argument. The basic picture is that while the gas at the Bondi radius can escape to vacuum (the molecule escape rate at the Bondi radius is discussed below), in order for mass loss to continue, gas from deeper in the planet's potential well has to reach the Bondi radius and replenish the escaping gas. However, as gas expands adiabatically to reach the Bondi radius, its temperature drops to zero after expanding only a scale height h = R 2 rcb /R B R rcb (simple adiabatic atmosphere solution). Therefore, in order to elevate the atmosphere out of the planet's potential well, a constant supply of energy is required. While most studies focus on ionizing stellar photons, which we consider in Section 4, as the energy source <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Murray-Clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owen &amp; Jackson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>, we first examine the envelope's own cooling luminosity (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2016</ref>) as an energy source driving mass loss (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ikoma &amp; Hori 2012</ref>, who consider the core's luminosity, which we also discuss below).</p><p>As we explain in Section 2, for γ = 7/5 the mass of the atmosphere is concentrated at the outside, at r ∼ R rcb (see discussion below for different values of γ). Therefore, the amount of energy needed to blow most of the atmosphere away is E evap ∼ GM c M atm /R rcb , where we approximate R rcb min(R B , R H ) for the shrinking phase after disk dispersal. The energy that the envelope loses by cooling, on the other hand, is concentrated in the inside, and is given by Equation (12). By comparing the two results, we find that the cooling inner envelope can blow off the outer atmosphere (which contains most of the mass) without changing its energy by much. Consequently, the planet loses mass while its energy, and therefore ρ(R c ) and ρ rcb , remain constant, due to Equation (10). The planet's radius, according to Equation (11), shrinks as it loses mass. Explicitly, the ratio of evaporation to cooling timescales is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">t evap t disk = t evap t cool = E evap E cool ∼ R rcb R c −(3−2γ)/(γ−1) ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where the first equality (t cool = t disk ) is trivial at disk dispersal (when R rcb = R 0 rcb R B ), since the planet has cooled for t disk . This equality continues to be true at later times (when R rcb &lt; R 0 rcb ) since both the energy, and the luminosity, given by Equation (15), depend only on ρ rcb (and not R rcb ), which remains constant during the mass loss phase. Consequently, t cool is constant during the mass loss. Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(23)</ref> shows that envelopes shed mass until they enter the thin regime R rcb ∼ R c , at a time comparable with t disk . Since, according to Equation (11), M atm ∝ R 1/2 rcb for γ = 7/5, and R c /R B ∼ 0.1, atmospheres retain roughly 30% of their initial mass when they enter the thin regime.</p><p>Explicitly, by combining the accreted atmosphere mass at disk dispersal, given by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref>, with the factor of ∼ (R c /R B ) 1/2 due to the outer envelope shedding, we derive the mass fraction of the atmosphere when it reaches the thick-thin transition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">f semi−thin ≈ 0.01 M c M ⊕ 0.44 T eq 10 3 K 0.25 t disk 1 Myr 0.5 .</formula><p>(24) Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(24)</ref> demonstrates that although it is easier to acquire a heavy atmosphere at larger orbital separations (see, e.g., Section 2, or Lee &amp; Chiang 2015), hotter cores (in close orbits) retain a heavier atmosphere after the disk dispersal and the shedding of the bloated (and weakly bound) outer envelope, since they reach higher densities, as explained in Section 2, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">M atm ∼ ρ(R c )R 3 c ∝ T 1/4</formula><p>eq at this stage (a strong increase of the opacity with temperature can change this conclusion, as discussed below).</p><p>For γ &lt; 4/3, as effectively chosen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang (2015)</ref>, the mass and the energy are both concentrated in the inside, so E evap ∼ E cool ∼ GM c M atm /R c , and the atmosphere mass is simply M atm ∼ ρ(R c )R 3 c . In this case, it is obvious that the loosely bound outer envelope is shed before the inner layers cool significantly, on a timescale t disk . Therefore, regardless of γ, atmospheres shed their outer layers and shrink to R rcb ∼ R c after the nebula vanishes. However, if γ &lt; 4/3, these outer layers do not contain significant mass, and atmospheres retain most of their initial mass when they reach the thin regime. Quantitatively, atmospheres retain 1 − 2 −(4−3γ)/(γ−1) ≈ 75% of their mass in this case (for γ = 1.2 chosen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>. The subsequent thin-regime evolution does not depend qualitatively on γ, as discussed below.</p><p>Once an envelope sheds its outer layers and enters the thin regime, the energy required to blow away its atmosphere is given by E evap ∼ GM c M atm /R c = M atm gR c . In order to check if the atmosphere continues to shed mass in the thin regime, we distinguish between two cases, according to Equation (21). Heavy atmospheres, with M atm /M c µ/µ c , regulate their own cooling, while the heat capacity of light atmospheres, with M atm /M c µ/µ c , is negligible, and they are controlled by the cooling rocky core underneath (which can cool only once the atmosphere is thin, see Section 3.1). Here M atm is the remaining mass of the semi-thin atmosphere, not the initial mass. Assuming an Earth-like composition for the rocky core, the critical gas to solid ratio which distinguishes between heavy and light atmospheres is f ≈ 5%.</p></div>

We conclude that heavy envelopes shrink by a maximal factor ≈ 7 before reaching their maximum gas density. This contraction lasts for 7 5/2 · t disk ≈ 10 2 · t disk ∼ 1 Gyr at most, since t disk is the cooling time for R rcb ∼ R c . Thus, atmospheres of Gyr old planets are no longer contracting, and their density is ≈ ρ max (we ignore here possible inflation mechanisms similar to those invoked for inflated hot Jupiters; see, e.g., Valencia &amp; Pu 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Light Atmospheres</head><p>Light atmospheres, on the other hand, start the thin regime (R rcb = R c ) with mass loss timescales which are shorter than their cooling time, according to Equation (21).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Transitional Disks</head><p>We have assumed above that the depletion of the disk is faster than the time it takes the atmosphere to adjust to the vanishing boundary condition ρ d → 0. Quantitatively, we assumed that t trans &lt; t evap , with t trans denoting the transition timescale for the disk to disperse. This assumption is justified by noticing that, considering Equation (23), 1/3 t evap /t disk 1, while, by definition, t trans &lt; t disk , and observations suggest that t trans /t disk ≈ 0.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexander et al. 2014</ref>). We therefore conclude that the finite disk dispersal time is irrelevant for our above analysis, since the mass-loss bottleneck is the energy release anyhow.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider the gradual decrease of the nebula's density ρ d over time. Because the gas accretion depends on ρ d logarithmically (see Section 2), cores can accumulate gas envelopes even in a depleted nebula, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang (2016)</ref>. Accretion from a gas-poor disk might be important if collisions of isolation masses (that occur only once the gas density is low enough so it cannot damp eccentricity excitations) remove their initial atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref>.

By combining Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> we find that the atmosphere's density increases as ρ rcb ∝ t 1/2 , while its radius decreases approximately as R rcb ∝ t −α , using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>, and assuming that the nebula has already depleted significantly. Consequently, using Equation (11), the mass of the atmosphere grows as M atm ∝ R 1/2 rcb ρ rcb ∝ t (1−α)/2 . We conclude that if the dispersal is gradual enough (α &lt; 1) then an atmosphere can grow while the disk is being depleted. This analysis is valid only as long as R rcb &gt; R c .

In this section we address another energy source -ionizing stellar photons. Mass lass by photo-ionization has been studied extensively, both in the context of hot Jupiters and super Earths ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baraffe et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe et al. , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baraffe et al. , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">Hub- bard et al. 2007a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Murray-Clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jackson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Valencia et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owen &amp; Jackson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>. The basic picture is that ionizing photons release energetic electrons which in turn heat the gas to high temperatures, above the escape velocity. If the cooling of the gas is slow enough, the high temperature gas escapes the planet's potential well. We emphasize that the stellar continuum radiation cannot heat the gas above the equilibrium temperature, which is lower than the escape velocity (below the Bondi radius). Therefore, the continuum radiation can only provide energy to elevate the gas to the Bondi radius, in a similar manner to the cooling luminosity, as described in Section 3.2 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2016)</ref>. In fact, the stellar continuum radiation which heats the gas has the same magnitude as the cooling luminosity ∼ σT 4 rcb R 2 rcb /τ . Here, we adopt the popular simplified energy-limited model for the photo-evaporation (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013</ref>, and references within), which linearly connects the high-energy flux to the gravitational energy of the escaping mass. Explicitly, we assume that the photo-evaporating flux can be written as L = 4πR 2 rcb σT 4 rcb , with ∼ 10 −4 taking into account both the evaporation efficiency ∼ 0.1 (see, e.g., Owen &amp; Wu 2013) and the small fraction of ionizing radiation out of the total bolometric stellar flux, which is taken to be a constant ∼ 10 −3 for the first t UV ∼ 100 Myr, and then decreases with time as t −1.25 (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jackson et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owen &amp; Jackson 2012</ref>, and references within).

The only way to retain the atmosphere is to ensure that t evap &gt; t UV .

Such massive atmospheres are problematic for two reasonsplanets might have lacked the time to accrete them (see Section 2), and the self gravity of these envelopes brings them close to the runaway accretion regime. We address the problem of nebular gas accretion followed by photoevaporation self-consistently, by writing the evaporation timescale in terms of the disk's lifetime 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">τ ∼ t evap t cool (R c ) t UV t disk ≈ 10,<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where τ ∼ κρ rcb h ∼ κρ rcb R 2 c /R B is the optical depth at the RCB. Equation (30) simply states that since the evaporation and cooling energies are the same at R rcb = R c (assuming the heavy regime), the ratio between the timescales is given by the ratio between the evaporation flux σT 4 rcb and the cooling flux σT 4 rcb /τ . t cool (R c ) is also equal to t disk (see Section 3.2). By substituting the density from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(20)</ref>, we obtain the condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">κM atm R c R B R c R B 1/(γ−1) t disk t UV ≈ 0.1.<label>(31)</label></formula><p>It is initially counterintuitive that a small envelope mass is required to survive evaporation, since t evap ∝ M atm . The reason is that t disk ∝ M 2 atm , as explained in Section 2, so for given disk and UV activity times, lighter envelopes survive evaporation because t evap /t disk ∝ M −1</p><p>atm . We substitute the atmosphere mass from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(24)</ref>, which takes into account self-consistently both the accretion and the spontaneous shedding of the outer gas envelope, and rewrite Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">M c M ⊕ 7.7 T eq 10 3 K 2.22 ,<label>(32)</label></formula><p>showing that cores have to be massive or "cold" (low equilibrium temperature) to keep an atmosphere. However, as discussed in Section 2 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>, cores which are too massive or cold are at the risk of runaway gas accretion. The overlap between the two conditions is discussed in Section 5. It is worthwhile to repeat the derivation of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(32)</ref>, which is one of our main results, for the case of γ &lt; 4/3, due to Hydrogen dissociation, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Piso et al. (2015)</ref>. The calculation in this case takes a simpler form since the mass of the atmosphere is concentrated in the inside, as the energy, so E ∼ GM c M atm /R c , and there is no significant spontaneous mass loss following the disk's dispersal (see Section 3.2). By repeating the calculation of M atm with γ = 1.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>, and substituting in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref>, we find that the qualitative shape of the critical curve for mass retention, described by Equation (32), does not change significantly. Specifically, we find that M c ∝ T 1.9 eq in this case. Equation (30) demonstrates that the RCB density ρ rcb has to be low, for the optical depth τ ∼ κρ rcb h to be low, enabling accretion to be efficient in comparison with evaporation. However, as explained in Section 2, ρ rcb has a lower limit dictated by the surrounding nebula ρ rcb &gt; ρ d (note that ρ rcb does not change during the thick atmosphere mass loss phase, since the energy, which is determined solely by ρ rcb remains constant, as explained in Section 3.2). Close enough to the star, the gas densities are high</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">ρ d = 10 −6 g cm −3 T eq 10 3 K 5.5 ,<label>(33)</label></formula><p>assuming the MMSN model (see Section 2. <ref type="bibr">1 and Hayashi 1981)</ref>. By substituting this minimal density in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(30)</ref> we obtain an additional condition relating the mass and temperature of planets with atmospheres</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">κρ d R 2 c R B t disk t UV ,<label>(34)</label></formula><p>or quantitatively</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">M c M ⊕ 10 −4 T eq 10 3 K 13 .<label>(35)</label></formula><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(35)</ref> also requires low temperatures (for low disk densities) and high masses (for a small scale height h = k B T /µg, due to the strong gravity). However, by comparing Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(32)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(35)</ref>, we find that the disk density constraint, given by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(35)</ref>, is relevant only for T eq 3000 K, rendering it irrelevant for the set of observations (see Section 5). This result remains true even for denser nebulae (up to a factor of 10 2 ), as seen in Equation (34).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Migration</head><p>We have so far assumed that gas accretion and UV evaporation occur at the same distance from the star, which allowed us to relate the evaporation time to the nebular accretion time, and to constrain the formation location and planet mass. Can separating the accretion from evaporation, due to migration during the nebula's presence, relax the constraints on the formation scenario? According to Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(24)</ref>, hotter cores (on closer orbits) retain a more massive atmosphere after the nebula disperses. Therefore, we intuitively expect, due to Equation <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, that these heavy atmospheres will survive the UV evaporation at later times.</p><p>We now consider gas accretion at an initial distance from the star characterized by an equilibrium temperature T i for a time ∼ t disk , followed by migration on a similar timescale (while gas is still present), and UV irradiation at a different orbit, characterized by T f . In this case, using Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, Equation (30) changes to</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">T i T f 4 1 τ i t UV t disk ,<label>(36)</label></formula><p>with τ i denoting the optical depth (which is relevant for accretion) at T i .

Consequently, if there is a strong increase of the opacity with temperature, inward migration during the gas disk's lifetime may relax the core mass constraint. The reason is that in this case colder cores accrete and retain more mass after the disk disperses, as seen by plugging the temperature-dependent opacity in Section 2. Specifically, using Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(24)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">COMPARISON WITH OBSERVATIONS</head><p>In previous sections we explained how accretion and evaporation histories limit the population of planets which can evolve in-situ into low density super Earths.

Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(38)</ref> with the approximation M ≈ M c (M is the observed mass) is a valid estimate for f 1, and indeed all planets in our sample have estimated f ≤ 20%. Our crude estimate of the gas fraction is in agreement (approximately) with more elaborate estimates, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. (2012)</ref>. We emphasize that an approximate estimate of f suffices, since we are mainly interested in distinguishing between purely rocky worlds and planets with substantial atmospheres (above a few % in mass) which have a significant volume. We plot in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> the limits of the thin envelope regime R c &lt; R 2R c , which according to our model confines super Earths older than ∼ 10 Myr. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> we present the allowed Goldilocks region in which super-Earths can hold on to substantial atmospheres, taking into account all the mass-loss processes mentioned in previous sections. Specifically, planets below the "Core" line in the figure are left with f &lt; 5% after disk-dispersal, and therefore lose their atmospheres in less than ∼ Gyr due to the cooling of the core, if they are also below the "Bondi" line (see Section 3.2.2). Planets below the "UV" line, on the other hand, lose their atmospheres due to UV irradiation, regardless of the "Bondi" line (see Section 4). Planets above the "Jupiter" line explode into gas giants during the disk's lifetime (see Section 2).</p><p>As demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, our model defines a relatively narrow mass/temperature range in which planets are massive and cold enough to acquire and retain an atmosphere, while not too massive and cold to go runaway and explode into gas giants. While it is not perfect, it is seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> that observed low-density super Earths seem to be restricted to the range predicted by our model. Some planets, on the other hand, seem to remain rocky, although they are in the Goldilocks region for acquiring and maintaining an atmosphere. A possible explanation to this diversity inside the Goldilocks region is giant impacts which remove gas <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2016</ref>).</p><p>An interesting outcome of the spontaneous shedding of the outer gas envelope after the nebula disperses is that atmospheres of planets just below the top line in <ref type="figure">Figure  3</ref> (which are on the verge of runaway accretion) are far from self gravitating. For our choice of γ, marginally selfgravitating atmospheres retain only ≈ 30% of their mass after the nebula vanishes, as discussed in Section 3.2. However, this result is sensitive to our choice of γ &gt; 4/3, and for γ &lt; 4/3 we expect marginally self-gravitating atmospheres to retain most of their mass. Quantitaviely, for γ = 1.2 (as chosen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>, atmospheres lose only ≈ 25% of their mass (see Section 3.2) following disk dispersal.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2013)</ref> define a mass-flux curve qualitatively similar to our bottom line of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, with hot or small planets losing their atmosphere due to UV evaporation, the considerations leading to their curve are different from ours.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this work we analyzed the conditions in which rocky cores of a few M ⊕ in mass acquire and retain voluminous atmospheres. Such atmospheres are necessary in order to explain some of the recently discovered Kepler lowdensity super Earths (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lissauer et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>We studied a scenario in which a pre-assembled rocky core accretes gas from the protoplanetary nebula. This scenario is relevant for the inner disk, where the assembly time for rocky cores is much shorter than the disk's lifetime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goldreich et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014</ref>). We also assumed that the gas density of the nebula is relatively low (MMSN), implying that atmosphere masses are determined by comparing their Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling time to the disk's dispersal time (the initial atmospheres which form adiabatically without cooling are negligible in mass). We found that in this scenario super Earths at ∼ 0.1 AU orbits acquire atmospheres of a few % in mass, in agreement with previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">In- amdar &amp; Schlichting 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015)</ref>. Despite the apparent consistency of this result with observations (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>), subsequent evolution of the planets, following the nebula's dispersal, has to be considered as well.</p><p>We found that once the gas disk disperses, at time t disk ∼ 10 Myr <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mamajek 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Williams &amp; Cieza 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alexander et al. 2014</ref>), atmospheres shed their outer layers due to loss of pressure support from the disk, and due to their own cooling luminosity (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2016)</ref>. Consequently, super-Earth atmospheres shrink to a thickness comparable with the radius of the rocky core R rcb ∼ R c , on a timescale ∼ t disk (equivalently, the plan-ets shrink to a radius ≈ 2R c ). When this thin regime is reached, we distinguish between two types of atmospheres:</p><p>• heavy envelopes, with atmospheric masses (as a fraction of the core mass) f ≡ M atm /M c 5%, retain their mass and contract until they reach the maximum gas density after ∼ 1 Gyr at most.</p><p>• light envelopes, on the other hand, with f 5% are lost entirely due to the cooling of the underlying rocky core, which dominates the heat capacity (but can cool only once the atmosphere is thin). In this case, the mass-loss timescale is determined by the finite escape rate of molecules traveling at the speed of sound through the Bondi radius.</p><p>In addition to this spontaneous mass shedding, gas envelopes are also vulnerable to evaporation by high-energy stellar photons (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>. In this work we examined both mass-loss possibilities and coupled them with the preceding nebular accretion phase. Our consistent treatment of accretion and evaporation allows us to relate the mass-loss timescale to the accretion time, and therefore to the disk's lifetime. Using these relations, we derived theoretical constraints on the planet's mass and equilibrium temperature (or equivalently, distance from the star) which enable the accretion and preserval of a significant atmosphere. Explicitly, we analytically identified a rather limited Goldilocks region in the temperature-mass plane, in which planets are massive and cold enough to obtain and retain an atmosphere, while not too massive or cold, so runaway gas accretion is avoided, and the planets do not become Jupiters. Observed low-density super Earths (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014</ref>) are indeed concentrated in this theoretically allowed region, though some features of the observed super-Earth population are not explained by our model, and may be due to giant impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It is noteworthy to mention <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>, who also coupled self-consistently core-nucleated accretion with the subsequent post-dispersal evolution, including mass loss. Despite the similar approach of both studies, we also point out the main differences. First, Rogers et al. (2011) focus on the scenario of formation beyond the snow line, at T eq ≈ 100 K, followed by migration to the current planet position of T eq ∼ 500−1000 K. We, on the other hand, focus on in-situ formation at the current planet location. This difference affects both the accretion history and the composition of the rocky core, which is ice-rich in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. In addition, although UV-driven evaporation is treated similarly in both studies, this work also incorporates spontaneous mass loss, which is absent from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref>. Finally, we compare our model to planets which have reasonable constraints on their mass from transit time variations or radial velocity measurements, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rogers et al. (2011)</ref> take a more general approach and use only the measured planet radius from Kepler to derive constraints on the possible mass and atmosphere fraction.</p><p>Our analytical model is simple, intuitive, and provides a consistent picture of gas accretion and evaporation, which seems to agree, at least approximately, with the observations. Nonetheless, there are several aspects of the model which deserve further attention:</p><p>• Although we coupled gas accretion and evaporation, we decoupled these processes from the assembly of rocky cores. At close orbits, planetesimal impacts may be ignored, as explained above, but giant impacts of protoplanets (or alternatively, inward migration of rocky cores) may be relevant, since isolation masses are small (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goldreich et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015</ref>).</p><p>• We assumed a sharp decrease in the nebula's gas density, after which gas accretion terminates. The disk dispersal is more gradual, and planets may accrete gas from a depleted nebula <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lee &amp; Chiang 2016)</ref>. This caveat is briefly discussed in Section 3.3.</p><p>• This work focused on low-density gas nebulae (MMSN), while other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Inamdar &amp; Schlichting 2015)</ref> argue for higher gas densities (near the Toomre stability limit), based on high solid disk masses which were invoked to explain the Kepler observations. A better estimate of the initial gas density is thus required in order to constrain super-Earth formation scenarios (if the density is low enough though, it does not affect the results, as explained above). Interestingly, our model can be used to test the presence (or absence) of high-density gas nebulae. In a dense nebula, the atmosphere mass is determined adiabatically, with cooling playing a minor role. By setting the runaway accretion condition f ∼ 1 in Equation (3), we find that the maximal stable core mass scales approximately as M c ∝ T −1 eq in such nebulae (since cooling is unimportant, this result is robust and does not depend on the opacity or other details of our cooling model). In light nebulae, on the other hand, the atmosphere mass is determined by cooling, and the maximal stable core mass increases with temperature, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 3</ref> (top line). An improved set of observations, with accurate masses, and sampling a broad range of equilibrium temperatures (separations), can distinguish between the two models, and constrain the typical nebula density.</p><p>• The multi-dimensional flow around an accreting planet may alter the one-dimensional results presented here <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(D'Angelo &amp; Bodenheimer 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fung et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ormel et al. 2015a</ref>,b). Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ormel et al. (2015b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fung et al. (2015)</ref> find that in 3D simulations the atmosphere gas is replenished from the nebula on timescales shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling time, resulting in lighter (i.e. higher entropy) envelopes. D <ref type="bibr">'Angelo &amp; Bodenheimer (2013)</ref>, however, find that the envelope mass decreases only by a factor of roughly 2.</p><p>Addressing these points, together with a more realistic treatment of UV photo-evaporation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Owen &amp; Wu 2013)</ref>, may improve our theoretical constraints on low-density super-Earth formation scenarios. In addition, a few extremely low density "super-puffs" (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lee &amp; Chiang 2016</ref>, and references within) might require a different formation scenario.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-Schematic temperature vs. density profiles (logarithmic scale) of a super-Earth atmosphere during the nebular accretion phase.
