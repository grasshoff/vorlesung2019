			<abstract>
				<p>Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1 to 1.7 Âµm). Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted 1-5. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances 6-8 , which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet&apos;s formation location 9 , but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes 1-4 , as found in some optical spectra 3,4,10,11. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures. A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 2 We observed the transits of eight hot Jupiters as part of a spectral survey of exoplanet atmospheres with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The eight planets covered in our survey (WASP-6b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, WASP-31b, WASP-39b, HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-12b) span a large range of planetary temperature, surface gravity, mass and radii, allowing for an exploration of hot-Jupiter atmospheres across a broad range of physical parameters (see Table 1). In this survey, we observed all eight planets in the full optical wavelength range (0.3-1.01 Âµm) using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument. We also used the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument to observe transits of WASP-31b and HAT-P-1b in the near-infrared (1.1-1.7 Âµm), and used additional WFC3 programs to observe transits of four other survey targets (WASP-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b and HAT-P-12b). The HST survey was complemented by photometric transit observations of all eight targets at 3.6 and 4.5 Âµm using the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) instrument. We analyzed the survey targets in conjunction with HST and Spitzer data from the two best-studied hot Jupiters to date, HD 209458b 1 and HD 189733b 5 , giving a total of ten exoplanets in our comparative study with transmission spectra between 0.3 and 5 Âµm (see Extended Data Table 1 for a detailed list of the observations). Our data reduction methods followed those in our previous studies 3,4,11-14 where the transmission spectra of WASP-19b, WASP-12b, HAT-P-1b, WASP-6b, and WASP-31b have been presented (see Methods for further details). The transit light curves 15 of the band-integrated spectra were fit simultaneously with detector systematics, with all HST and Spitzer transit data used to determine the planets&apos; orbital system parameters (inclination, stellar density, and transit ephemeris), which were then fixed to the weighted mean values in the subsequent analysis measuring the transmission spectra. To create the broad-band transmission spectrum, we extracted various wavelength bins for the HST STIS and WFC3 spectra and separately fit each bin for the planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R * and detector systematics. The uncertainties for each data point were rescaled based on the standard deviation of the residuals, and any systematic errors correlated in time were measured using the binned residuals 16. The resulting transmission spectra are shown in Fig. 1 and exhibit a variety of spectral absorption features due to Na, K, and H 2 O, as well as strong optical scattering slopes (e.g. WASP-6b and HAT-P-12b). Planets such as WASP-39b show prominent alkali absorption lines with pressure-broadened wings, whereas other planets such as WASP-31b show strong but narrow alkali features, implying they are limited to lower atmospheric pressures. H 2 O vapour has been predicted to be a significant source of opacity for hot Jupiter atmospheres 17-19 , and it is detected in five of the eight exoplanets where WFC3 spectra are available 1-5,13,14. However, the amplitude of the H 2 O absorption varies significantly across the ten planets, ranging from features that are very pronounced (as in WASP-19b) 14 to those that are significantly smaller than expected (HD 209458b) 1 or even absent (WASP-31b) 4. Previous studies using HST/WFC3 spectra have shown that HD 209458b, HD 189733b, and WASP-12b have low-amplitude water features 1,3,5 which can be attributed to a severe depletion of atmospheric H 2 O abundance relative to solar values 6-8. Any such depletion would be a remnant of planet formation, as H 2 O is expected to be well-mixed in a hot atmosphere, such that currently measured molecular abundances would be consistent with primordial values. The depletion of water vapour can occur beyond a protoplanetary disk&apos;s snow line 9 , where water is found predominantly as solid ice. Therefore, a hot Jupiter with a large depletion in H 2 O A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 3 gas would imply the planet formed at large orbital distances beyond the snow line and, during its inward orbital migration, avoided accretion and dissolution of icy planetesimals as well as the subsequent accretion of appreciable H 2 O-rich gas. Such scenarios have been proposed for Jupiter 20,21 based on Galileo probe measurements 22 that indicate it is a water-poor gas giant, though the measurements were affected by local meteorology 22. However, it is possible that these weak water absorption bands could be attributed to cloud opacity, which have yielded featureless transmission spectra for a number of transiting exoplanets 23,24. For simplicity we define a cloud as a grey opacity source, while a haze as one that yields a Rayleigh-scattering-like opacity, which could be due to small (sub-Âµm size) particles. Silicate or higher temperature cloud condensates are expected to dominate the hotter atmospheres, like those observed for brown dwarfs, while in cooler atmospheres sulphur-bearing compounds are expected to play a significant role in the condensation chemistry 25,26. In Fig. 2, we plot model atmospheric pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles for the planets in our comparative study and compare them to condensation curves for expected cloud-forming molecules. The base, or bottom, of condensate clouds is expected to form where the planetary P-T profiles cross the condensation curve; in this case, Cr, MnS, MgSiO 3 , Mg 2 SiO 4 and Fe are possible condensates. For example, the spectra of WASP-31b shows clouds 4 , which likely form at pressures of ~10 mbar and can be explained by Fe or MgSiO 4 condensates. However, the curves alone cannot explain cloud versus cloud-free planets, as hazy planets such as HAT-P-12b and WASP-12b do not cross condensation curves at observable pressures. Therefore, atmospheric circulation must also play a role, as vertical mixing allows for particles to be lofted and maintained at pressures probed in transmission at the terminators. Additionally, equatorial eastward superrotation arising from day-night temperature variations can allow for clouds that form on the nightside to be transported to the terminator 27.

Contaminating effects of persistent unocculted star spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and plages <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> have been hypothesized to mimic the optical haze scattering signature of hot Jupiters (particularly HD 189733b, which orbits an active star; see Methods). However, our survey sample is sufficiently varied in stellar activity, such that we find no correlation between stellar activity and the strength of the optical scattering slope (as measured by the ÎZ UB-LM index) for planets in our sample (Extended <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Data Fig. 3)</ref>. One of the main distinguishing features between hazy atmospheres and those that are clear and have sub-solar abundances resides in the near-infrared continuum, measured with the WFC3 spectra. The presence of haze raises the level of the nearinfrared continuum relative to the mid-infrared continuum, leading to high ÎZ J-LM index values with low near-infrared H 2 O amplitudes (Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 4</ref>). In clear atmosphere models, where the abundances are lowered, the continuum level drops at both near and mid-infrared wavelengths, accompanied by a reduction in the amplitude of absorption features, resulting in ÎZ J-LM index values that are too low to explain the data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3)</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Error bars represent the 1Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â measurement uncertainties. Purple and grey lines show model trends for hazy and cloud atmospheres, respectively, with increasing Rayleigh scattering haze and grey cloud deck opacity corresponding to 10x, 100x, and 1,000x solar. We also show clear-atmosphere models with sub-solar The hot Jupiter transmission spectra ordered by the ÎZ UB-LM spectral index reveals a continuum from clear atmospheres to atmospheres with strong clouds and hazes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The presence of clouds has also been inferred for brown dwarf atmospheres, which have similar temperatures to hot Jupiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> . While there is a well-defined sequence from the warmer, cloudy L-dwarfs to the cooler, clear T-dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , hot Jupiters do not exhibit a strong temperature relationship to cloud formation, as both types appear throughout the entire 1,000 to 2,500 K temperature range <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. We suggest that the nature of the difference between hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs is due to the vertical temperature structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres. Hot Jupiters have dramatically steeper P-T profiles compared to isolated brown dwarfs, due to the strong incident stellar flux heating the top of the planetary atmosphere (see Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 5</ref>). Since cloud condensation curves run nearly parallel to hot Jupiter profiles, a relatively small temperature shift (~100 K) could easily move a cloud base by a factor of tens or hundreds in pressure, in or out of the visible atmosphere. In comparison, as brown dwarfs have shallow P-T profiles, clouds will form in the visible atmosphere across a very wide temperature range. Furthermore, the expected nearly-isothermal region of a hot Jupiter profile from ~1 to 100 bar pressures may lead some planets, but not others, to have cloud materials cold-trapped at depth, out of the visible atmosphere. Given this temperature sensitivity, the role of clouds in hot Jupiters may appear almost stochastic from planet to planet. In addition, hot Jupiters have a wider range of gravities and metallicities, both of which will affect the planet's atmospheric temperature structure, circulation, and condensate formation.</p><p>Future studies will benefit greatly from broad atmospheric surveys that can further distinguish between clear and cloudy exoplanets. If the ÎZ UB-LM , ÎZ J-LM , and H 2 O indices can be measured in advance of such surveys, planets with clear atmospheres can be identified and studied in greater detail, allowing reliable chemical abundances to be measured and thus providing valuable constraints on formation models.</p><p>Online Content Methods, along with any additional Extended Data display items and Source Data are available in the online version of the paper; references unique to those section appear only in the online paper.</p><p>A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 9      </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>HST Observations. The overall observational strategy is similar for each of the eight targets in the Large HST programme (GO-12473; P.I. Sing), which have been presented for WASP19b 14 , HAT-P-1b 12,13 , WASP-12b 3 , WASP-31b 4 and WASP-6b <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> with the details summarized here and applied to the remaining targets HAT-P-12b, WASP-17b, and WASP-39b. We observed two transits of each target with the HST STIS G430L grating, and one with the STIS G750L. The G430L and G750L data sets contain typically 43 to 53 spectra, which span either four or five spacecraft orbits and were taken with a wide 52 Ã 2 arcsec slit to minimize slit light losses. Both gratings have resolutions of R of Î»/ÎÎ» = 530-1040 (~2 pixels is 5.5 Ã for G430L and ~2 pixels is 9.8 Ã for G750L). The G430L grating covers the wavelength range from 2900 to 5700 Ã, while the G750L grating covers 5240 to 10270 Ã. The visits of HST were scheduled such that the third and/or fourth spacecraft orbits contain the transit, providing good coverage between second and third contact, as well as an out-of-transit baseline time series before and after the transit. Exposure times of 279 s were used in conjunction with a 128-pixel wide subarray, which reduces the readout time between exposures to 21 s, providing a 93% overall duty cycle.</p><p>The STIS data set was pipeline-reduced with the latest version of CALSTIS, and cleaned for cosmic ray detections with a customized procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> . The G750L data set was defringed using contemporaneous fringe flats. The spectral aperture extraction was done with IRAF using a 13-pixel-wide aperture with no background subtraction, which minimizes the outof-transit standard deviation of the white-light curves. The extracted spectra were then Dopplercorrected to a common rest frame through cross-correlation, which helped remove sub-pixel A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 12 wavelength shifts in the dispersion direction. The STIS spectra were then used to create both a white-light photometric time series and custom wavelength bands covering the spectra, integrating the appropriate wavelength flux from each exposure for different bandpasses.</p><p>Observations of HAT-P-1b and WASP-31b were also conducted in the infrared with the HST WFC3 instrument as part of GO-12473 and are detailed in refs. 4 and 13. The observations use the IR G141 grism in forward spatial scan mode over five HST orbits. Spatial scanning is done by slewing the telescope in the cross-dispersion direction during integration in a similar manner for each exposure, which increases the duty cycle and greatly increases the counts obtained per exposure. We used the 'ima' outputs from the CALWFC3 pipeline, which performs reference pixel subtraction, zero-read and dark current subtraction, and a non-linearity correction. For the spectral extraction, we trimmed a wide box around each spectral image, with the spectra extracted using custom IDL routines, similar to IRAF's APALL procedure. The aperture width was determined by minimizing the standard deviation of the fitted whitelight curve. The aperture was traced around a computed centring profile, which was found to be consistent in the y-axis with an error of &lt; 0.1 pixel. Background subtraction was applied using a clean region of the untrimmed image. For wavelength calibration, direct images were taken in the F139M narrow-band filter at the beginning of the observations. We assumed that all pixels in the same column have the same effective wavelength, as the spatial scan varied in the x-axis direction by less than one pixel, resulting in a spectral range from 1.1 to 1.7 Âµm. This wavelength range was later restricted to avoid the strongly sloped edges of the grism response, which results in much lower S/N light curves.</p><p>For the comparative study, we also included the WFC3 observations for WASP-19b 14 , HD 209458b 1 , HAT-P-12b 2 , and WASP-17b 31 (GO-12181, P.I. Deming). The WFC3 observations of WASP-12b 3 were also included (GO-12230, P.I. Swain), as was HD 189733b 5 (GO-12881; P.I. McCullough). The WFC3 observations of WASP-12b, WASP-17b, WASP19b, and HAT-P-12b were observed in stare mode, rather than with spatial scanning, and therefore have generally poorer overall photometric precision. See Extended Data <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for a list of all observations. Spitzer Observations. The eight targets in the large HST survey were also all covered by Spitzer transit observations as part of an Exploration Science Programme (90092; P.I. DÃ©sert) obtained using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) instrument with the 3.6 Âµm and 4.5 Âµm channels in subarray mode (32 Ã 32 pixels). Photometry was extracted from the basic calibrated FITS data cubes, produced by the IRAC pipeline after dark subtraction, flat-fielding, linearization, and flux calibration. The images contain 64 exposures taken in a sequence and have per image integration times of 1.92 s. Both channels generally show a strong ramp feature at the beginning of the time series, and we elected to trim the first ~20 min of data to allow the detector to stabilize. We performed outlier filtering for hot (energetic) or cold (low-count values) pixels in the data by examining the time series of each pixel and subtracted the background flux from each image 11 .</p><p>We measured the position of the star on the detector in each image incorporating the flux-weighted centroiding method using the background subtracted pixels from each image, for a circular region with a radius of 3 pixels centred on the approximate position of the star. We extracted photometric measurements from our data using both aperture photometry from a grid of apertures ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 pixels (in increments of 0.1) and time-variable aperture photometry. The best result was selected by measuring the flux scatter of the out-of-transit portion of the light curves for both channels after filtering the data for 5Ï outliers with a width of 20 data points.</p><p>Transit Light Curve Analysis. All the transit light curves were modelled with analytical transit models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . For the white-light curves, the central transit time, orbital inclination, stellar density, planet-to-star radius contrast, stellar baseline flux, and instrument systematic trends were fit simultaneously. The period was initially fixed to a literature value, before being updated, with our final fits adopting the values obtained from an updated transit ephemeris. Both G430L transits were fit simultaneously with a common inclination, stellar density, and planet-to-star radius contrast. The results from the HST white-light curve and Spitzer fits were then used in conjunction with literature results to refine the orbital ephemeris and overall planetary system properties. To account for the effects of limb-darkening on the transit light curve, we adopted the four parameter non-linear limb-darkening law, calculating the coefficients with stellar models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</p><p>As in our past STIS studies, we applied orbit-to-orbit flux corrections by fitting for a low-order polynomial to the photometric time series phased on the HST orbital period. The baseline flux level of each visit was free to vary in time linearly, described by two fit parameters. In addition, for the G750L we found it justified by the Bayesian Information Criteria 34 (BIC) to also linearly fit for two further systematic trends which correlated with the x and y detector positions of the spectra, as determined from a linear spectral trace in IRAF. The orders of the fit polynomials were statistically justified based on the BIC, and the systematic trends were fit simultaneously with the transit parameters.</p><p>The errors on each data point were initially set to the pipeline values, which are dominated by photon noise but also includes readout noise. The best-fitting parameters were determined simultaneously with a Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> using the unbinned data. After the initial fits, the uncertainties for each data point were rescaled based on the standard deviation of the residuals and any measured systematic errors correlated in time ('red noise'), thus taking into account any underestimated errors calculated by the reduction pipeline in the data points. The uncertainties on the fitted parameters were calculated using the covariance matrix from the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which assumes that the probability space around the best-fitting solution is well described by a multivariate Gaussian distribution and equivalent results were found when using an MCMC analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . Inspection of the 2D probability distributions from both methods indicated that there were no significant correlations between the planet-to-star radius contrasts and systematic trend parameters.</p><p>In an additional analysis step compared to our previous results 4,11,12 , we also marginalized over the systematic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> for the spectra of WASP-17b, WASP-39b, HAT-P1b, HAT-P-12b, and HD 209458b. Under this approach, we effectively averaged the results obtained from a suite of systematics models in a coherent manner. For each systematic model used to correct the data, we calculated the evidence of fit, which is then used to apply a weight to the parameter of interest (Rp/R * ) measured using that model. In doing so, we marginalised over our uncertainty as to selecting which model is actually the "correct" model. For the STIS data we included all combinations of factors up to the 4th order in both HST phase, 3rd order in detector positions x and y, 3rd order in wavelength shift, and 1st in order in time. For the WFC3 data, our grid of parameterized models includes all combinations of factors up to the fourth order in both HST phase, to correct for "HST breathing" effects, and up to the fourth order in wavelength shift, in addition to the visit-long linear trend. In addition, we also included exponential HST phase models, with a linear and squared planetary phase trend. For the Spitzer data, we included all combinations of the x and y positions of the stellar PSF on the detector, including the cross-product from polynomials of x and y up to a second-order. We note that the best-fitting systematics models for HST and Spitzer are generally well constrained and the marginalized results were very similar to those based on model selection by the BIC. For HD 209458b, lightcurve analyses and marginalization were performed using Gaussian process (GP) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> . Due to the flexibility of GP models, a broad range of systematics behaviours can be captured without the need to provide an explicit functional form. The results of a single GP model are thus comparable to marginalising over many simpler parametric systematics models, as was done for the other lightcurves 37 .</p><p>Atmospheric Models. The synthetic spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> used for this study include isothermal models as well as those with a self-consistent treatment of radiative transfer and chemical equilibrium of neutral and ionic species. Chemical mixing ratios and opacities were calculated assuming local thermochemical equilibrium accounting for condensation and thermal ionization but not photoionization 40-43 for both solar metallicity and sub-solar metallicity abundances.</p><p>A simplified treatment adding in small aerosol haze particles was performed by including a Rayleigh scattering opacity (i.e. Ï = Ï 0 (Î»/Î» 0 ) -4 ) that had a cross section which was 10Ã, 100Ã, and 1,000Ã the cross section of molecular hydrogen gas (Ï 0 = 5.31 Ã 10 â27 cm 2 at Î» 0 = 350 nm 44 ). Similarly, to include the effects of a flat cloud deck we included a wavelength independent cross section, which was 1Ã, 10Ã, and 100Ã the cross section of molecular hydrogen gas at 350 nm (see Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 4</ref>).</p><p>Transmission Spectral indices. To enable a direct comparison between planets, the transmission spectra have been plotted on a common scale by dividing the measured wavelength-dependent altitude of the transmission spectra, z(Î»), by the planet's atmospheric scale height (H eq , the vertical distance over which the gas pressure drops by a factor of e) estimated using the equilibrium temperature. The analytical relation for the wavelengthdependent transit-measured altitude z(Î») of a hydrostatic atmosphere is 44 , Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â± Â§ Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â = Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â°Â» ln Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â 2Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â± / Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â¼ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â±Â where Îµ is the abundance of the absorbing or scattering species, P is the pressure at a reference altitude, Ï(Î») is the wavelength-dependent cross-section, Ï is the optical thickness at the effective transit-measured radius, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the local gas temperature, Âµ is the mean mass of the atmospheric particles, g the planetary surface gravity, R p the planetary radius, and H = kT/Âµg is the atmospheric pressure scale height. The altitude difference measured between two wavelength regions (Î» and Î»') in a transmission spectrum is proportional to the quantity, where Î± is the absorption plus scattering extinction coefficient, Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â»Â¼ = Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼ÂÃ­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â(Ã­ ÂµÃ­Â¼Â).</p><p>Thus, the quantity ÎZ Î»-Î»' = z(Î») -z(Î»') is related to the ratio of the total scattering plus absorption of the atoms and molecules between the wavelengths regions Î» and Î»', and we use the quantity ÎZ Î»-Î»' /H eq = ln (Î± / Î±') as a metric to intercompare the atmospheric extinction for the different planets in our survey. Note that the temperature and scale height of the upper atmosphere can differ from the equilibrium value, especially at high altitudes where hot upper layers in hot Jupiters have been found 45-48 .</p><p>We defined indices around three main wavelength regions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We used a blue-optical band consisting of the G430L grating, which is sensitive between 0.3 and 0.57 Âµm and roughly covers the Johnson U and B photometric bandpasses. This wavelength region is almost always exclusively dominated by scattering for clear, cloudy and hazy exoplanets (see Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 4)</ref>. The second is a near-infrared band between 1.22 and 1.33, which has overlap with the Johnson J photometric band, and is located between the strong H 2 O absorption bands centred around 1.15 and 1.4 Âµm. This wavelength region is sensitive to the scattering continuum in hazy, cloudy and highly sub-solar models and the H 2 O continuum in clear atmospheres with abundances near solar (see Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 4</ref>). We also used a third wavelength region in the mid-infrared between 3 and 5 Âµm, which overlaps with the Johnson L and M photometric bandpasses and consists of the two Spitzer IRAC photometric channels 1 and 2. This wavelength region is highly sensitive to strong H 2 O, CO and CH 4 absorption bands, which are the main active molecular species expected in hot Jupiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> , and only sensitive to scattering in the cloudiest cases, making it an overall effective measure of the total molecular extinction (see Extended <ref type="figure">Data Fig. 4</ref>).</p><p>From the data, ÎZ UB-LM was measured taking the difference between the planet radius measured in the blue-optical HST data using the G430L grating (UB, wavelengths 0.3 to 0.57 Âµm) and the weighted-average value of the radii measured in Spitzer IRAC photometric channels 1 and 2 (LM, wavelengths 3 to 5 Âµm). ÎZ J-LM was measured similarly, although using the near-infrared WFC3 data (J, wavelengths 1.22 to 1.33 Âµm).</p><p>In addition, we also measured the amplitude of the near-infrared H 2 O absorption band using the WFC3 spectra (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), measuring the average radii in a band containing strong H 2 O absorption (between 1.34 and 1.49 Âµm) compared to an adjacent band between strong H 2 O features (1.22 and 1.33 Âµm). The measured H 2 O amplitude for each exoplanet was then divided by the value predicted by atmospheric models 17,39 calculated for each planet using a planetary averaged temperature-pressure profile assuming clear atmospheres and solar-abundances.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, a likely inverse correlation is seen between the H 2 O amplitude and the ÎZ J-LM /H eq index, with the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measured to be -0.76 which has a false alarm probability (f.a.p.) of 2.8%. We note that this f.a.p. is not the probability that the water depletion scenario is correct, as that is excluded with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref> to a much higher degree (5.9Ï significance). A much weaker inverse correlation of -0.48 is found with ÎZ UB-LM in Extended Data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, though that has a high f.a.p. of 23%. Stellar activity. As stellar activity can affect the measurement of a transmission spectrum, we photometrically monitored the activity levels of our target stars with the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory (CTIO) 1.3 m telescope for the southern targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> and the Tennessee State University Celestron 14-inch (C14) Automated Imaging Telescope (AIT) located at Fairborn Observatory in Arizona for the northern targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> . All but two of our targets showed low levels of stellar activity, with observed photometric variations or upper limits which are sufficiently small that their effects on measuring the transmission spectra are minimal compared to the measurement errors 3,4,11-13 . The two most active stars in the survey, WASP-19A and HD 189733A, were corrected for occulted and un-occulted star spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> . As no contemporaneous photometric monitoring of WASP-19A is available for the July 2011 WFC3 spectra from ref. 14, we matched the spectra to the spot-corrected transit depth of R p /R * =0.14019Â±0.00073 as measured using HST WFC3 on 12 June 2014 from GO-13431 (P.I. Huitson), which had simultaneous CTIO activity monitoring. We also normalized the differential transit depths of the WFC3 spectra 5 to a transit depth value consistent with ref. 10, which has a uniform treatment between the HST and Spitzer datasets of system parameters, limb-darkening, and activity correction.</p><p>As effects of stellar activity could potentially mimic an optical scattering slope in a transmission spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> , we searched for a relationship between the activity levels of the stars in our survey and the presence of a strong optical slope. If stellar activity were the main cause of the enhanced optical slopes, rather than scattering by hazes or clouds, then it is expected that highly active stars would have higher levels of spots and plages, and should show preferentially larger transmission spectral slopes. As an additional measure of stellar activity, we used the strength of the Ca II H &amp; K emission lines as a stellar activity indicator (log(R' HK ), as measured by <ref type="bibr">Keck HIRES 50,51</ref> , see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We searched for a correlation with the chromospheric activity index log(R' HK ), as it is correlated with the stellar photometric variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> and can be used to quantify stars with low activity levels, for which the photometric variations would be undetectable. We found no significant correlation with log(R' HK ) activity and either the presence of haze or the strength of optical transmission spectral slope, as measured with the ÎZ J-LM index (Extended <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Data Fig. 3</ref>). This suggests that the effects of stellar activity are not the overall cause of the strong optical slopes seen in some of the transmission spectra.</p><p>There are also other indications that stellar activity does not play a dominant role. For one, while changing stellar activity levels should have an effect on the transmission spectra, no significant variations were seen between the three epochs of the HST STIS spectra, which has an overlapping wavelength region, for all of our targets including active stars. In addition, the atmospheric temperature can be derived by measuring the transmission spectral slope in an atmosphere dominated by Rayleigh scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> , and the temperatures found fitting a Rayleigh scattering slope for HD 189733b, HAT-P-12b and WASP-6b (1340Â±150, 1010Â±80, 973Â±144 K respectively) are in good agreement with the planetary temperatures expected (T eq of 1196, 958, 1183 K respectively). This agreement is consistent with the atmospheric temperature, rather than stellar activity, being probed by the scattering haze. For these three stars, where HAT-P-12 has a much lower activity than the other two, the individual activity levels would have to be finely tuned so the spectral slopes would mimic the planetary temperatures.</p><p>A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 17</p><p>In addition to condensation chemistry 53 , hazes can also form through photochemical processes resulting in hydrocarbon aerosols <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> . This process is more effective for cooler exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> and the incident stellar UV irradiation also plays an important factor in hydrocarbon formation 54 . Our results indicate no correlation with the presence of haze to either the atmospheric temperature or levels of UV irradiation (as traced by stellar activity indicators), which generally favours condensation chemistry over photochemical processes as the general source of the observed hazes and clouds.</p><p>Code availability. We have opted not to make the customized IDL codes used to produce the spectra publically available owing to their undocumented intricacies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 | HST/Spitzer transmission spectral sequence of hot-Jupiter survey targets.A continuum from clear to cloudy hot-Jupiter exoplanets without primordial water depletion 5 optical altitudes.</head><label>15</label><figDesc>Figure 1 | HST/Spitzer transmission spectral sequence of hot-Jupiter survey targets.

The thicker portions of the lines indicate the pressures probed in transmission for the hot Jupiters (plotted in greyscale) and the visible photosphere for the brown dwarf (0.1 to 10 bars). While a shift in the P-T profile of a hot Jupiter to hotter and cooler temperatures could dramatically change which condensates may be found in the visible atmosphere, the same would not be true for much shallower brown dwarf P-T profiles.</figDesc></figure>
