				<p>The relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen is a potent tracer of planet formation and evolution. Jupiter and Saturn have protosolar D/H ratios, a relic of substantial gas accretion from the nebula, while Neptune and Uranus are enhanced in D by accretion of ices into their envelopes. For terrestrial planets, D/H ratios are used to determine the mechanisms of volatile delivery and subsequent atmosphere loss over the lifetime of the planet. Free-floating planets and brown dwarfs more massive than ∼13 M J quickly fuse their initial D reservoir. Here, we simulate spectra from T eff =200-1800 K including both CH 3 D and HDO to determine the observability of these dominant deuterium isotopologues in mid-infrared thermal emission spectra. Colder objects have stronger molecular features in their spectra, due to the temperature-dependence of molecular cross sections. CH 3 D is easier to observe than HDO at all temperatures considered, due to the strength of its absorption bands and locations of features at wavelengths with few other strong absorption features. For objects from 250-450 K closer than 10 pc, a protosolar D/H ratio would be readily observable in 5 hours with JWST. Moderately young Jupiter-mass planets (100-300 Myr) and young Neptunes (10 Myr) may be discovered with JWST and provide the best targets for detecting deuterium on an exoplanet in the coming decade. Future telescope designs should consider the importance of isotopes for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With current instruments, it is possible to detect molecules and elements in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kirkpatrick 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charbonneau et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kreidberg et al. 2014</ref>). The atmospheric enrichment and ratios of elemental abundances inform us about how an object formed: the atmospheres of brown dwarfs that collapse directly out of a molecular cloud are predicted to form with the same elemental abundances as more massive stars forming in that cloud, while planets that form in a disk via core accretion and gas/planetesimal accretion will have abundance patterns that reflect the material available at their locations in the disk ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Oberg et al. 2011</ref>). For example, planets that form beyond the water ice line will accrete both gas and water-rich ices into their atmospheres; depending on the ratio of gas to ice accreted, the object would have a super-or sub-solar metallicity and C/O ratio ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Espinoza et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>In studies of the solar system, a complementary and critical tool for tracing planet formation and evolution is the relative abundances of different isotopes of the same element. One important element is deuterium: the deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio traces a host of different physical processes in an atmosphere, including accretion of solids and gas, atmospheric escape, and deuterium fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Owen 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lecluse et al. 1996)</ref>. In this Letter, we review these processes and examine the possibilities for detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere.</p></div>

Ices, both interstellar and within disks, become enhanced in deuterium through several chemical pathways at the cold temperatures (&lt;50 K) present in these environments: gas-phase ion-neutral reactions and grain-surface formation from ionization-generated hydrogen and deuterium atoms from H 2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cleeves et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0.1.">D/H in Giant Planets Traces Accretion of Solids</head><p>Deuterium was first detected outside of the Earth in Jupiter's atmosphere by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Beer et al. (1972)</ref>. Since then, the deuterium abundances in each of the giant planets have been measured in the near-and mid-infrared using CH 3 D features and in the visible and far-infrared using HD rotational features ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Knacke et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kunde et al. 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Courtin et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">de Bergh et al. 1986</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Bergh et al. , 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Feuchtgruber et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lellouch et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lellouch et al. , 2010</ref>. Jupiter and Saturn have D/H ratios consistent with the protosolar value, while Uranus and Neptune are enhanced in deuterium by a factor of ∼2.5.</p><p>The classical picture is that the giant planets formed by accretion of ices and gases onto a core of ∼10-15 M Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Stevenson 1982)</ref>. For Jupiter and Saturn, the relative mass of the core and heavy elements is small compared to the gas accreted, so the D/H ratio traces the primordial composition of the solar nebula gas. For Uranus and Neptune, more than half of their total masses were accreted as ices; their envelopes are enhanced compared to the solar nebula gas, tracing the relative amount of D-enriched ices that accreted:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(D/H) planet = (D/H) ices (1 − x H2 ) + (D/H) proto x H2 (1)</formula><p>where <ref type="formula">(</ref>  Pollack 1983). As Venus went through a runaway greenhouse, its oceans evaporated and H 2 O photodissociated in its upper atmosphere.

Mars' D/H ratio is similar to Oort cloud comets. Since Mars does not have plate tectonics that recycle the crust with mantle material, this may reflect a late veneer of accretion from comets rather than a primordial reservoir <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Drake 2005</ref>).</p></div>

Those more massive than 20 M J will efficiently fuse almost all deuterium within 20 Myr; objects under 11 M J will never fuse their deuterium, retaining primordial abundances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Spiegel et al. 2011</ref>). The mass at which a brown dwarf will have burned 50% of its deuterium is roughly 13 M J , but depends slightly on initial He fraction, metallicity, and primordial D/H ratio, and is expected to typically range between 12.2 and 13.7 M J ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Spiegel et al. 2011</ref>).

Our canonical cases assume a protosolar D/H ratio of 2×10 −5 , typical for formation conditions of stars in the local group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESULTS</head><p>Our results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 2, 3</ref>, and 4. Two key results include that (1) CH 3 D is more observable than HDO at all temperatures considered and (2) at colder temperatures CH 3 D has stronger features and can be detected with lower SNR spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">CH 3 D is More Observable than HDO</head><p>CH 3 D has a stronger impact on the spectrum than HDO for all objects with methane-rich atmospheres. The top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows scaled cross sections of important molecular gases in a cold brown dwarf. The models here are cloudfree, but when clouds are included they provide additional continuum opacity.</p><p>One of the strongest molecular features of CH 3 D is at ∼4.55µm. This wavelength region is a "window" in atmospheric opacity for cold brown dwarfs, since the important absorbers in the atmosphere-H 2 O, CH 4 , and NH 3 -have low opacity at these wavelengths. For a trace species like CH 3 D, a smaller amount of the species is necessary for it to be spectroscopically detectable. In contrast, HDO has features across the near-and mid-infrared (e.g., 3.7 µm), but these overlap with absorption features from the more dominant species.</p><p>The resulting spectra are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. Models including CH 3 D have spectral features that decrease the flux within the absorption bands by up to ∼2%; the strongest HDO features cause a maximum change in flux of ∼0.5%.</p><p>Furthermore, while the 4.55 µm band of CH 3 D is in the brightest wavelength region for a cold brown dwarf, the 3.7 µm HDO band is within an absorption feature, so the brown dwarf is intrinsically fainter at those wavelengths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Temperature Strongly Controls Presence of D-features</head><p>T eff strongly affects the strength of both CH 3 D and HDO features due to an intrinsic property of molecular opacities: the peak-to-trough amplitude of molecular cross sections in the infrared is strongly correlated with temperature; this is illustrated for water vapor in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, bottom panel. At 200 K, the water cross section between 2.5 and 4.5 µm varies between ∼ 10 −19 and 10 −27 cm 2 /molecule, while at 2000 K it varies between ∼ 10 −20 and 10 −22 cm 2 /molecule. This striking difference-8 vs. 2 orders of magnitude difference between the absorption band and window-means that the window regions of cold objects probe relatively deeper layers. The larger column of material probed means that a feature from a trace species like CH 3 D is more prominent in a colder object. This fact has been exploited for decades to detect trace species at ∼5 µm in Jupiter, including CH 3 D, PH 3 , and GeH 4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bjoraker et al. 1986</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Simulations of JWST Observations</head><p>We calculate the signal-to-noise of the spectrum necessary to distinguish between a model with and without each deuterated species assuming a protosolar abundance (D/H = CH 3 D/CH 4 = HDO/H 2 O = 2×10 −5 ), using a chi-squared rejection test <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gregory 2005</ref>). The SNR needed increases with increasing temperature. HDO always requires a SNR greater than 300 for a 3σ detection; CH 3 D requires a SNR less than 300 for objects with temperatures ≤600 K.</p><p>We then simulate the G395H/F290LP grating/filter combination mode of JWST/NIRSpec (2.87-5.14 µm, R∼2700), using the JWST online exposure time calculator tool <ref type="bibr">(Pon- toppidan et al. 2016</ref>). We assume that each object is 10 pc away, and assume total observation times of 5 hours and 10 hours, including dither time. Dithering is necessary because above SNR∼300, JWST is flat-field limited. HDO is never detectable in our simulated observations in either a 5 hour or 10 hour integration. CH 3 D is detectable in objects between 250 and 450 K in &lt;5 hrs. These results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Minimum Resolving Power &amp; Wavelength Ranges Needed</head><p>The molecular bands of CH 3 D are relatively broad in wavelength (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2 and 3</ref>; however, to identify individual features within that broad band, a resolving power of ∼1000 is required (see middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). The most useful wavelength range is from 4-5 µm; CH 3 D also has a feature at 8.5 µm, but with higher background and fainter source at longer wavelengths with JWST/MIRI, the 4-5 µm region is always favored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Retrieving D/H Ratios from JWST Spectra</head><p>Using the atmospheric retrieval tools recently applied to brown dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Line et al. , 2017</ref> we quantitatively determine the degree to which we can constrain the CH 3 D/CH 4 ratio with NIRSpec on JWST. We use the identical forward model parameterization and Bayesian parameter estimation tools to those presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Line et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Line et al. ( , 2017</ref>), but the model is upgraded to include PH 3 and CH 3 D. We tailor the retrieval setup to match the atmospheric structure of a 300 K, logg=5, solar metallicity, cloud-free Y dwarf with D/H=2×10 −5 . We can constrain the ratio of CH 3 D/CH 4 to (2.1 ± 0.2) × 10 −5 with a 10-hour observation. These constraints are remarkable, but in these simulations the forward model is a perfect match to the data; hidden, unforeseen assumptions or systematic errors could inhibit these constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Detecting Deuterium with High Dispersion</head><p>Spectroscopy from Ground-based Telescopes</p><p>Mollière &amp; Snellen (2018) recently showed that deuterium may be detectable for exoplanets from the ground using highdispersion spectroscopy. They find that CH 3 D may be detectable at 4.7 µm using current instruments for transiting planets below 700 K. Future ELT-class telescopes will allow detections for a wide range of planets. They also find that HDO is more challenging because methane shields HDO absorption. This technique will be complementary to the moderate-resolution spectroscopy with telescopes like JWST considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Converting CH 3 D/CH4 to D/H</head><p>Above, we assumed CH 3 D/CH 4 equals D/H (i.e., the molecules are in isotopic equilibrium). However, isotopic exchange depends on temperature. Deep, hotter layers are expected to be in isotopic balance, but colder upper layers probed by these measurements may not be. The actual CH 3 D/CH 4 ratio is determined by a vertical mixing timescale and isotopic exchange timescale. At the top of the atmosphere, the relative abundance f of CH 3 D/CH 4 compared to bulk D/H is 1.25 for Jupiter, 1.38 for Saturn, 1.68 for Uranus, and 1.61 for Neptune ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lecluse et al. 1996</ref>). The objects considered here are hotter than these planets, and would therefore be closer to isotopic balance ( f =1.0-1.25). Our approximation is conservative; if f is higher, the amount of CH 3 D is larger and therefore easier to detect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Interior Physics, Masses, and Ages of the Coldest Brown Dwarfs</head><p>For objects with known masses, detecting deuterium could allow us to estimate their ages and test models of deuterium fusion as a function of mass. Our calculations demonstrate that deuterium is most observable in the coldest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs. The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows a simulation of the number of brown dwarfs at a given temperature, assuming that the initial mass function is a power law (index α=1), and with a uniform age distribution between 0 and 10 Gyr. A 13 M J object cools to 300 K in 10 Gyr, so for objects under ∼300 K, all simulated objects have masses less than the deuterium-burning limit (M&lt;13M J ). For objects between 300 and 400 K, ∼30-68% have M&lt;13M J ; for hotter objects, the fraction of brown dwarfs with M&lt;13M J drops off to ∼1-2% for T eff &gt;800 K.</p><p>Quantifying the presence of deuterium in a range of Y dwarf atmospheres tests the assumptions made in the simulation and thus the properties of field brown dwarfs. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dupuy &amp; Liu (2017)</ref> showed that nearby brown dwarfs with mass measurements have systematically younger ages (a median of 1.3 Gyr and an age interval of 0.4-4.2 Gyr for a sample of 10 systems) than the 0-10 Gyr range simulated here; thus, more of them are likely to be deuteriumrich. Sampling a range of 250-500 K objects would test this prediction and provide an independent way of measuring the age of local substellar objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Planet Formation and Envelope Accretion</head><p>In our own solar system, the two largest giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have D/H abundances consistent with the protosolar nebula, while the lower mass Neptune and Uranus are enhanced by a factor of several due to accretion of ices during planet formation. Measuring deuterium enhancement or depletion in exoplanets allows us to test planet formation mechanisms in other systems. Multi-planet systems will be particularly valuable since the primordial D/H ratio varies within the galaxy.</p><p>JWST will be capable of detecting cool Jupiters and Neptunes around nearby M dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beichman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Schlieder et al. 2016</ref>). Jupiter-mass exoplanets with ages of 100-300 Myr will have temperatures of <ref type="bibr">250-300 K (Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) and radii of 1.1-1.15 R J , so if any such nearby planets are discovered with JWST, they will require comparable SNR spectra to the free-floating objects considered here to detect CH 3 D.</p><p>Young objects (10 Myr) with masses twice that of Neptune are predicted to have temperatures around 200-225 K and radii around 6-9 R Earth . If their atmospheres are enhanced in metals and in deuterium, CH 3 D may be detectable in their spectra (see Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this Letter, we have presented spectra of model brown dwarfs and free-floating planets including both HDO and CH 3 D for objects from 200-1800 K. CH 3 D requires a lower SNR spectrum to detect than HDO at all temperatures. Colder objects have stronger spectral features due to the inherent properties of the cross sections of molecular species, which have larger differences in absorption between troughs and peaks at colder temperatures. For objects from 250-450 K, a protosolar CH 3 D/CH 4 ratio of 2×10 −5 , would be detectable in spectra with average SNR per spectral element from 100-300, achievable for these objects with 5 hours of integration time with JWST, assuming a distance of 10 pc. Colder objects will have stronger lines, but require more time to observe since they are fainter; warmer objects have weaker lines and are not readily observable with JWST.</p><p>The D/H ratio has been an important tracer of planet formation, gas accretion, and atmosphere evolution in the solar system since the 1970s when CH 3 D was first detected in Jupiter. For brown dwarfs and free-floating planets in the near future, similar measurements will allow us to map their masses and ages and test models of their interior physics. For exoplanets from Neptune to Jupiter mass, D/H measurements will allow us to understand envelope accretion for planets outside the solar system. These measurements pave the way for future studies of terrestrial planets, for which D/H measurements trace the accretion of their atmospheres and their evolution over their lifetimes.</p><p>We acknowledge the JWST Help Desk, who provided invaluable assistance while developing simulations of JWST observations. This work was performed in part under contract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) funded by NASA through the Sagan Fellowship Program executed by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig- ure 1 .Figure 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
