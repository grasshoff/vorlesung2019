				<p>We examine the ability of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to detect and improve our understanding of planetary systems in the Kepler field. By modeling the expected transits of all confirmed and candidate planets detected by Kepler as expected to be observed by TESS, we find that TESS has a greater than 50% chance of detecting 277 of these planets at the 3σ level in one sector of observations and an additional 128 planets in two sectors. Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only ∼ 5 percent of known multiply-transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect TESS to be a powerful tool to characterizing transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 (KOI-142) as an example, we show that TESS will improve measurements of planet-star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Since TESS will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether TESS will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems. We find two confirmed planetary systems (Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b) and five candidate systems that will be good candidates to detect tidal decay.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Kepler spacecraft ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) is a groundbreaking instrument that has detected thousands of exoplanets, including several that are Earth-sized and lie in the habitable zone of their host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Thompson et al. 2018)</ref>. It has also altered the way that we think about the formation and structure of planetary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rowe et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mullally et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Coughlin et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Thompson et al. 2018)</ref>. Although Kepler has been a valuable tool thus far in exoplanetary studies, most Kepler stars are too faint for detailed follow-up, such as obtaining precise RV measurements to determine the planets' masses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ricker et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, if a system has more than one planet, we can utilize the system's transit timing variations (TTVs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Holman &amp; Murray 2005)</ref> to teach us more about the system. TTVs occur in multi-planet systems due to gravitational interactions between plan-ets and can be visible in transit timing data since they force planets off of a strictly Keplerian orbit. TTVs can be used to not only confirm planetary systems but also to measure system mass ratios and orbital parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fabrycky et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nespral et al. 2017</ref>). Furthermore, TTVs allow us to significantly improve our characterization of planetary systems by deriving the physical parameters of the systems, such as the star/planets' absolute mass, eccentricity, and inclinations, especially when combined with other data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Montet &amp; Johnson 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almenara et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, TTV measurements from Kepler are not perfect. Since the mass measurements from TTV signals strongly depend on orbital parameters such as period ratio and eccentricity and since for many systems we do not have enough data from Kepler to measure these precisely <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fabrycky et al. 2013</ref>), we have either large uncertainties or only upper limits in mass measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2012</ref>). Additionally, many TTVs are still degenerate after four years since the period of many TTV systems are comparable in length or longer than the Kepler observing baseline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holczer et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mazeh et al. 2013</ref>). This means that in order to obtain more precise measurements of TTVs, orbital parameters, and mass measurements, we need to increase the Kepler four year baseline by continuing to observe these systems. This is where TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ricker et al. 2016</ref>), comes into play. TESS was launched in April 2018, and will perform an allsky survey to catalog the nearest and brightest stars in our local neighborhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Ricker et al. 2016</ref>). This will make TESS planets some of the best characterized planets that exist since consistent follow-up observations will be easily performed in the future. Since TESS will be performing an all-sky survey, it will re-observe the Kepler field. Thus, TESS will extend the amount of time we have observed these systems from four to ten years which will allow us to examine the long-term dynamical effects that exist in planetary systems. This analysis will be critical in multiple ways. First, we may discover additional planets which did not transit in the Kepler era but will transit when TESS observes the system (e.g. dynamical perturbations may allow previously non-transiting planets to transit, and/or the planets' periods were longer than the Kepler four-year baseline). Additionally, more data on these systems will allow us to better constrain the systems' planetary parameters.</p><p>In this paper we discuss the procedure that utilizes previously obtained Kepler data with soon to be obtained TESS data to improve planetary parameters' measurements. We demonstrate how we can use Kepler data in conjunction with TESS's predicted transit times to improve our measurements of various systems and to allow us to explore other effects such as tidal decay of hot Jupiters.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss our method for discovering what types of planets TESS is sensitive to. In Section 3, we determine how well we can improve our measurements of masses and eccentricities with TESS data by analyzing a best-case scenario system, KOI-142. In Section 4, we examine the detectable planets from Section 2 and determine how many of these systems we have a strong chance of observing tidal orbital decay with TESS. In Section 5, we offer conclusions and look to the future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Finding Probabilities of Detection</head><p>Our goal in this section is to determine how many and what types of planets TESS will detect in the Kepler field, thus increasing the observation baseline for these systems from four to ten years. This increased baseline with TESS will improve our measurements of systems and will allow us to better and more accurately test theories on planetary formation and migration.</p><p>We use the stellar and planetary properties from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mathur et al. (2017)</ref> for systems in the NASA Exoplanet Archive to determine the types of planets TESS will be sensitive to. We consider planets labeled as "confirmed" or "candidate" and neglect any systems identified as false positives. We use the contamination ratios ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) and the observed transit depths from <ref type="bibr">Ke- pler (Thompson et al. 2018</ref>) to recover the actual transit depths for each planet. We contaminate the actual transit depths with TESS's contamination ratios <ref type="bibr">(Stas- sun et al. 2018</ref>) to find the transit depths that TESS is expected to observe for each system.</p><p>To find the total uncertainty expected in TESS photometry for each system, we apply the projected noise estimate given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 14</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref> and retrieve the total noise for each observation, given a TESS apparent magnitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stassun et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Given the total noise, the calculated TESS transit depth, the Kepler transit duration, orbital period, and an exposure time of 30 minutes, we compute the expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for each planet. In the above calculations, we compute the SNR for both the case that TESS will observe the Kepler field for one or two sectors: the length of observation for any given star will depend on the exact pointing of the telescope in 2019, but much of the field will be observed for two sectors.</p><p>To convert these SNRs to probabilities of detection we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Christiansen et al. (2015)</ref>, assuming the probability of detection is a function of the observed SNR, following a logistic function centered at a 7.1σ detection threshold. This idealized scenario was not achieved for Kepler, but may be for TESS, depending on the noise characteristics in real data from that instrument. We also consider detection at the 3σ threshold, as a lower significance might be acceptable for the characterization of known planets, rather than the discovery of new planets. We retrieve probabilities of detection for each planet, weighted by the relative likelihoods of observing N transits given the planet's orbital period and the TESS observing baseline. We repeat this analysis under the scenario that each planet is observed for either one or two sectors. Thus, we found two probabilities of detection per planet: one probability given that the star will be observed for one sector, and another that the star will be observed for two sectors. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the radius and period of all confirmed and candidate planets discovered by Kepler, highlighting the systems that we predict have a greater than 50% chance of being detected by TESS. At the 7.1σ level, we find 86 (124) confirmed planets and 80 (100) candidate planets that will be detected by TESS in one (two) sector(s) of observations. At the 3σ level, there are 161 (249) confirmed and 116 (156) candidate planets that are detectable in one (two) sector(s). In total, we expect TESS is likely to recover 277 (405) of these signals originally detected by Kepler in one (two) sectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Results</head><p>A majority of the planets that are detectable at either the 3σ or 7.1σ level are large planets in short orbits around their host star: most of the Kepler planets that TESS will detect are hot Jupiters. Nevertheless, it is still important to note that smaller planets can be detected as long as their host star is bright and small in size. For example, the planet candidate KOI-06635.01 orbits a 14.353 magnitude star with a radius of 0.41 R with an orbital period of 0.5274 days. Despite being 1.5 R ⊕ in size, we project this planet will be detectable.</p><p>Using the probabilities of detection for each planet, we next perform a simple analysis of how successful TESS will be at observing multi-planet systems. We compute the probabilities for different scenarios (e.g. in a one planet system, the probability of detecting no planet or one planet) which is represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>. Unfortunately, it is clear that for all multi-planet systems, TESS has a large probability of detecting none of the known transiting planets in a given system. In only ∼ 5 percent of known multiply-transiting systems do we predict more than one planet to be recovered, which agrees well with <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref>'s finding that 5-10 percent of the KOIs will be recovered with TESS. The eventual launch of PLATO, projected for the mid-2020s, will provide a better opportunity to investigate these systems. ). What makes KOI-142.01 so unique is that it has one of the largest recorded TTV amplitudes of 12 hours and is one of the only systems to show measurable transit duration variations (TDVs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2013</ref>). With this system we show an example of the expected improvement of planetary parameters by combining TESS and Kepler data for well-characterizable systems.</p><p>KOI-142's parameters are already well-measured due to the uniqueness of fits from successful modeling. This success led Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nesvorn´y et al. (2013)</ref> to precisely determine the system's mass ratios. KOI-142's mass ratios were found to be: M b /M * &lt; 5.2 × 10 −5 and M c /M * = (6.32) +0.19 −0.13 × 10 −4 . With this information they determined that KOI-142b is a sub-Neptune class planet with a mass upper limit of 17.6 M ⊕ and that KOI-142c is a non-transiting planet with a mass of 215.9 +7.6 −7.5 M ⊕ ( 0.7M J ). KOI-142b and KOI-142c orbit their central G-type star at periods of 10.95 days and 22.34 days, respectively.</p><p>Since we have precise values for many of this system's parameters, teams have been able to test theories for this system's formation and migration and have ruled out several possibilities due to the system's architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Silburt &amp; Rein 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in our understanding of this precisely characterized system and in systems that are not as well-measured. We next describe our process for calculating the extent to which TESS will improve our measurements and understanding of KOI-142.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">MCMC Analysis</head><p>To find the posterior distribution and covariance between parameters, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for this system. We write a function that inputs potential sets of parameters into TTVFast ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Deck et al. 2014</ref>) and outputs a series of transit times for all the planets in the system within a specified time interval. We then compare all of the transits observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Holczer et al. 2016</ref>) to the predicted times from TTVFast. The χ 2 values from this comparison were outputted and used to create a likelihood function. We combine our likelihood function with flat priors on all orbital parameters to perform an MCMC analysis for KOI-142 with thirteen degrees of freedom (the thirteen varying planetary parameters, listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  2</ref>). We use the affine invariant ensemble sampler emcee <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goodman &amp; Weare 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>), using 150 walkers. We ran our MCMC 20,000 steps, discarding the first 10,000 steps as burn-in, and next use the Markov chains to compute the spread in transit times and uncertainties for future years when TESS will observe this system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Spread in O-C Transits</head><p>We use all of the Markov chains after burn-in and input each set of parameters into TTVFast, with the endpoint of integration set to the beginning of the year 2020. We create an O-C (Observed minus Calculated) plot for the inner planet where Observed are the outputted transits from TTVFast and Calculated are the transit times based on a constant-period model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sterken 2005</ref>).  Note- <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> will be published in its entirety in machine-readable format on the journal website. A portion is reproduced here as a guide for formatting. A version is also available in the source materials for this manuscript on the arXiv.   <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. (Left) A radius versus period plot of all confirmed and candidate planets detectable by Kepler. Given a detection threshold of 7.1σ, the red data points are planets that have a probability greater than 50% of being detected by TESS in one sector (27.4 days). The blue data points are the additional planets that have a probability greater than 50% of being detected by TESS if it observes the Kepler field in two sectors (54.8 days). The histograms on the x and y-axis represent the spread in orbital period and planet radius, respectively. (Right) The same plot as the left except with a 3σ detection threshold. Out of the 4,456 Kepler planets in total, TESS will only be able to recover a small portion of these signals; nevertheless, TESS is expected to detect a large number of hot Jupiter planets and will thus be able to improve our measurements of these systems.</p><p>The results from this section are in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. The leftmost figure shows KOI-142.01's TTVs in minutes from the year 2009 to 2020 using all of the Markov chains after burn-in. The rightmost figure is a portion from this O-C plot in 2019, with the green band representing the time when TESS will observe KOI-142.01 (plotted using 100 randomly-selected sets of transits for clarity). For example, for a given two-planet system, the probability of detecting no planets in that system is 0.970, the probability of recovering one planet is 0.026, and the probability of recovering two planets is 0.004. (Right) The probabilities of detecting various scenarios in multi-planet systems for a detection threshold of 3σ. Out of all the Kepler multiplanet systems, TESS will have a very low probability of being able to recover more than one planet, regardless of what signal detection threshold is used.</p><p>There is a very obvious spread in the transit times during the period that TESS will observe the system which means that there is certainly room for improvement in our knowledge of this system. We then proceed to calculate the uncertainty in those transit times and determine by what factor we can reduce the transit uncertainty with TESS in July 2019.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Calculating Uncertainty in Transit Times</head><p>We use all of the Markov chains after burn-in and investigate the standard deviation of the expected time of each transit in the future, shown in green in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>The uncertainty in the transits from 2009 until around 2013 are very small since Kepler was observing KOI-142 during that time span. After 2013, there is an underlying, upward trend in transit uncertainties since we are no longer receiving data from the system.</p><p>The behavior of the future TTVs is nonlinear and correlated with the TTVs shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. At some points in the TTV cycle, the spread in transit times is relatively large, and a precise observation of an observed transit at those times would be useful to provide better constraints on the orbital parameters of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">TESS's Computed Transit Uncertainty</head><p>In order to calculate TESS's transit uncertainty for KOI-142, we estimated the transit time uncertainty from TESS data, based on TESS's expected performance. For this, we develop simulated light curves using the batman package of (Kreidberg 2015). We initially ran batman with our best fit parameters from Section 3.2 at a time of inferior conjunction of 0., using a quadratic limb darkening model and limb darkening coefficients given by Claret (2017)'s models for a star with the physical parameters of KOI-142. We sample a flux value every 10 minutes (simulating three transits observed at 30 minute cadence) and add noise by sampling from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1500 ppm, TESS's expected sensitivity for KOI-142 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sullivan et al. 2015</ref>). We then treat those flux values with the added noise as "observed" data points. We vary the transit time for our model 3000 times on a linear grid with a width of 0.2 days and calculate the χ 2 between each models' flux values and our noisy "observed" values. We turn these χ 2 values into a posterior distribution on the time of transit. The 16th and 84th percentile time values for our posterior were measured and we obtained a standard deviation on the expected time of transit of 0.0117 days (16.9 minutes).</p><p>It is clear that with TESS's predicted transit uncertainty, we will be able to improve our measurements of this system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Improving our Measurements of KOI-142</head><p>To quantify how much we can improve our measurements of the masses and eccentricities of these planets with TESS, we first went through a similar process as described in Section 3.2. The only difference is that we now include a new transit time observation in midJuly 2019 in our likelihood function. This new transit time observation is the mean of all of the transit times obtained from the Markov chains for mid-July 2019 (BKJD = 3823.01 days 1 ) with an uncertainty given by the standard deviation calculated in 3.5. After running MCMC again, we analyze the best fit parameters and errors of the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> lists each of the parameters values and associated errors for both the analysis without TESS data (Section 3.2) and with TESS data (this section). The factor of improvement of our knowledge of this system with TESS data is in the last column.</p><p>We expect the eccentricity measurements of both planets to be significantly improved, and the mass of <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BKJD = BJD -2454833</head><p>the inner planet to be improved by more than 5 percent. Even though the periods for both of these planets were well constrained with just Kepler data, we expect to obtain even more precise period measurements with TESS, with the period uncertainties improving by 42 and 11% for the inner and outer planet, respectively. Due to the considerable improvement on most orbital parameters and planet-star mass ratios, the transit timing uncertainty is significantly reduced in the future: a single month of observations reduces the scatter in transit times expected in 2026 from 68 minutes to 33 minutes.</p><p>To illustrate this future improvement, we calculate the transit time uncertainty the same way as in Section 3.4 but now also included our data associated with the new Markov chains. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>, the green data points are transit uncertainties without any TESS data and the blue data points are transit uncertainties with our predicted TESS data in July 2019. There is clearly a large improvement that will be made when TESS observes this system; continued transit observations (such as through an extended TESS mission) will reduce the future uncertainties even further.</p><p>In this work, we only consider the effects of TTVs, not transit duration variations (TDVs), which are observed for this system with a semiamplitude of ∼ 5 minutes. Our orbital parameters are similar to those of Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. (2013) even without TDVs (but with three additional quarters of data which were not available at the time of that publication), suggesting the TDV information does not drive the fit. However, TDVs will be important for this system on TESS timescales. The authors of that paper note they cannot discriminate between two orbital solutions: one with Ω ≈ 90 • and one with Ω ≈ 270 • . These two solutions imply a mutual inclination of 2.7 • or 4.5 • , respectively, as the inner planet could have an inclination either just above or just below 90 • . However, these two models predict very different transit durations in 2019. In the case where Ω ≈ 90, the inner planet will have b ≈ 0 when TESS observes the system, so the transit duration will be approximately 220 minutes. In the other case, b ≈ 0.8 and the transit duration will be 140 minutes. These two will be easily separable with TESS.</p><p>For many dynamically interacting systems in which TESS will be able to detect transits, the combination of TESS and Kepler data will be useful to measure system parameters better than Kepler alone. A detailed analysis of many of these systems, originally characterized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hadden &amp; Lithwick (2017)</ref> is forthcoming (M. Goldberg et al. in prep).  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2017)</ref> investigated the transit timing anomaly of WASP-12b, a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of 1.09 days, and modeled this planet's orbital period, arguing that WASP-12b is more likely in orbital decay than in a precession cycle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Patra et al.

Further investigations of WASP-12b's transit timing anomaly agree that WASP-12b is likely in orbital decay and that classifying WASP-12 as a subgiant accurately explains the observed change in period as well as its decay timescale of 3 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Weinberg et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bailey &amp; Goodman 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Ragozzine &amp; Wolf (2009) demonstrated how measuring apsidal precession enables one to infer properties of the interior structure of the planet and star, such as k 2 and Q * . k 2 , known as the Love number, is the level of central condensation of a planet or star, where a small k 2 corresponds to a strong central condensation. Q * is the tidal quality parameter of a star which is the measure of the star's response to tidal distortion due to a perturbing body. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ragozzine &amp; Wolf (2009)</ref> similarly mention that a longer baseline will be necessary in order to measure apsidal precession in many very hot Jupiter systems.</p><p>In Section 2.2, we showed that TESS will be able to observe many of the hot Jupiters detected by Kepler. We now investigate whether TESS will be powerful enough and will considerably extend the baseline of observations such that we can measure orbital decay or precession and learn more about the interior structure and formation of hot Jupiter planets and their host stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Hot Jupiter Transit Uncertainties in July 2019 with Kepler and TESS</head><p>In the following analysis we consider all planets from Section 2.2 with radii smaller than 30 R ⊕ that were detectable in two sectors at a 3σ level.</p><p>We propagate the errors from the period and transit epoch (obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive) into July 2019 to compute the uncertainty in transit times given Kepler data alone.</p><p>To compute the TESS uncertainty we simulate light curves using the batman package of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kreidberg (2015)</ref> as in Section 3.5. We create a model for each planet and add noise by sampling from a normal distribution with a standard deviation give by the expected noise from TESS calculated in Section 2.1 and listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We contaminate the flux values of the model depending on the TESS contamination ratio for that system and use these new flux values as "observed" data. We vary the time of inferior conjunction many times and use the same limb darkening coefficients as in 3.5. This time, we sample a flux value every 2 minutes within a 30 minute interval, assuming most detectable hot Jupiters will be observed at short cadence, but we stack transits together depending on the planet's period so the time of sampling varies for each system. We find the posterior distribution of transit times, measure the 1σ width of this distribution, and take that as the expected transit timing uncertainty for each system. To find the total uncertainty in July 2019 we combine the uncertainty in the transit times inferred from TESS data with the uncertainty from Kepler data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Hot Jupiter Transit Times in July 2019</head><p>We first calculate the expected transit time in July 2019 for these systems based on a constant-period model.</p><p>We next calculate the transit time in July 2019 for these systems using an orbital-decay model. To do this, we first find the change in period due to orbital decay using <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Patra et al. (2017)</ref>'s Eqn. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dP dt = − 27π 2Q * M p M R a 5 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Q * is the tidal quality parameter of the star. Since we do not have measurements for M p for many systems, we first assume all planets with radii larger than 8 R ⊕ to be a Jupiter mass planet. We calculate M p for planets with radii less than 8 R ⊕ by using the planet mass-radius relationship ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>). Given the predicted period for a linear ephemeris and our given uncertainties in the transit time, we determine a threshold value for Q * that will make each system detectable at 3σ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Candidate Decaying Systems</head><p>We compute the ratio of the transit difference between the models and the total uncertainty in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. We calculate the threshold Q * values that would make orbital decay detectable at 3σ, which we call Q * ,c . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows the spread in Q * ,c values that would make orbital decay detectable at 3σ. A typical value of Q * is around 1 × 10 5 (Dobbs- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dixon et al. 2004</ref>) and so any planets that have Q * ,c ≥ 1 × 10 5 will be good candidates to potentially measure orbital decay.</p><p>We find two confirmed systems and six candidates that have Q * ,c ≥ 1 × 10 5 and are thus good candidates for orbital decay detection. We inspect the light curves of each candidate system by eye. We conclude that KOI-7430 is a likely false positive and exclude it from our analysis, leaving seven systems in total. Two of these are confirmed planets: Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b (KOI-2 and KOI-13). The other five are planet candidates; these are KOI-1075, 3156, 5220, 5353, and 7259. Histogram showing the spread in Q * ,c values (calculated using planet mass-radius relation) for systems that have a greater than 50% chance of detection with TESS in two sectors at the 3σ level. The seven systems with Q * ,c greater than 10 5 will be good candidates for potentially detecting orbital decay, or placing meaningful limits on the values of Q * .</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> we list the Q * ,c values for ten detectable planets at the 3σ level in two sectors. We calculated Q * ,c as discussed in the previous sections (using the planet mass-radius relationship to compute masses for planets smaller than 8 R ⊕ ). As the planet masses are typically unknown, we also provide values for Q/M p , in units of Jovian masses. As masses of these planets are measured, these updated masses can be used directly to update the expected Q * ,c values.</p><p>TESS is essential for this task. For each of the seven candidate or confirmed systems with log(Q * ,c ) &gt; 5.0, we repeat this exercise considering Kepler data alone, finding that in all cases TESS transits provide a significant extra constraint. For the median system, we find log(Q * ,c ) increases by 0.52 when TESS observations are added to the existing Kepler data, increasing our sensitivity to Q * by a factor of 3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Fisher matrix analysis</head><p>One may ask how new data from TESS can compete with the highly-precise four-year Kepler dataset. Or, if Kepler was not sensitive to tidal decay for the set of planets it observed, how will TESS be sensitive to it. The answer is that the phase change of a decaying planet is quadratic, so the longer one waits, the more powerful the lever arm gets for constraining this curvature. We perform a Fischer-matrix analysis to determine the minimum-variance bound for each of three parameters, a = (T 0 , P, ˙ P ), in which the model time is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">t m (i) = T 0 + iP + 1 2 i 2 ˙ P , (2)</formula><p>where i is the transit number with 0 at the center of the Kepler dataset. The figure-of-merit is</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ 2 = (t(i) − t m (i)) 2 σ 2 i (3)</formula><p>where the mid-time and error bar of a measured transit i are t(i) and σ i . The curvature of the χ 2 surface informs the minimum size of uncertainties in the parameters, and this calculation is shown in the Appendix. The uncertainties on the three parameters from Kepler alone are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">σ T 0 = 3/2(σ/ √ N ) (4) σ P = 2 √ 3(P/T )(σ/ √ N ) (5) σ ˙ P = 12 √ 5(P/T ) 2 (σ/ √ N ). (6)</formula><p>We then consider a second dataset augmenting the first dataset, which has the centers of the two datasets offset by D in time, with a value (in the case of TESS, likely smaller) of σ 2 / √ N 2 , and a time baseline T 2 (within the second dataset, over which transits are uniformly spread). If the values of these survey parameters are as given in Model 2 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>, for instance, then the uncertainty on T 0 will improve by 23%, the uncertainty on ˙ P will improve by 48%, and the uncertainty will worsen by 1% on P . We did not shift the zero of the transit number array i, hence adding the new dataset introduces mild correlations between T 0 and P and between P and ˙ P , whereas before only a correlation between T 0 and ˙ P was present. Consequently, the uncertainty of the orbital period grows. The period derivative itself, the quantity of interest for tidal decay, always improves with more data, however.</p><p>Two real examples, to which we apply this formalism, are KOI-13 and KOI-18. The former is systematicsdominated in Kepler, and transit times uncertainties determined by TESS may be only ∼ 2.3 times larger than Kepler. The uncertainty on period change will decrease by a factor of about 3, with 1 sector of TESS observations. In the case of KOI-18, both Kepler and TESS are photon-limited, and hence a more modest improvement is expected <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 4)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We analyzed TESS's capabilities in detecting and improving our measurements of planetary systems in the Kepler field.

The majority of these recovered signals are hot Jupiter planets; nevertheless, there are still some smaller, rocky planets that can be recovered, such as KOI-6635.01, which orbits a small, bright star. Although the Kepler signal detection threshold was 7.1σ, we believe that a 3σ level will be largely sufficient for TESS in the Kepler field since the goal is to characterize planets that are already known to exist, rather than detecting new planets. Additionally, it is important to note that throughout this analysis we made the following assumptions: 1) we assumed that <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sullivan et al. (2015)</ref>'s model is correct in predicting the total noise TESS will experience while observing each system, 2) that the total noise was completely white, and 3) that the contamination ratios from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stassun et al. (2018)</ref> are correct (for the Kepler contamination ratios, we took the median ratio of the four ratios recorded, one for each telescope orientation). If any of these assumptions are incorrect or too restrictive, our results will differ from what we originally predicted. When the TESS data is available in January, 2019, the validity of these assumptions will be better understood.</p><p>Using our probabilities of detection for each planet, we organized our data such that we could determine how capable TESS will be in detecting multi-planet systems. We found that TESS will be expected to recover more than one planet in only ∼ 5 percent of known multi-planet systems. Future studies dealing with multi-planet systems will likely be more successful with PLATO observations of the Kepler field, perhaps in the mid-2020s.</p><p>For planets that TESS will be able to detect, we expect that TESS will be a very useful tool in improving our measurements of these systems. For KOI-142, we predict that TESS will improve a majority of the planetary parameters as well as star-planet mass ratios, which yields an improvement of over 50% in the transit timing uncertainties in the future.</p><p>Since we predict TESS will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we analyzed whether TESS will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in hot-Jupiter systems. We found two confirmed and five candidate planets that will be good candidates for detecting orbital decay. If we are able to detect orbital decay in any of the systems in the Kepler field we will be able to better understand their interiors and perhaps more accurately test theories of planetary formation and migration.</p><p>We find in general that long time baseline observations of planetary systems with space-based observatories can be useful for understanding the physical parameters and long-term evolution of planetary systems. This is applicable to combinations of Kepler and TESS data, but also to missions like K2, where data spanning multiple years when multiple campaigns overlap can be used to confirm and measure masses of dynamically interacting planetary systems (A. <ref type="bibr">Hamann et al. in prep)</ref>.</p><p>Although TESS may not be as sensitive to as many planets as Kepler, we show that TESS will be extremely effective in improving our measurements and understanding of certain systems. We are looking forward to receiving data from TESS in the Kepler field and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of planets beyond our solar system.</p><p>We thank Matthew Payne (Harvard CfA) for helpful comments which improved the quality of this manuscript.</p><p>C </p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∂ 2 χ 2 ∂a j ∂a k ,<label>(A1)</label></formula><p>from which the correlation matrix can be derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">C j,k = 1 2 ∂ 2 χ 2 ∂a j ∂ k −1 .<label>(A2)</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>IMPROVING ORBITAL PARAMETERS OF DYNAMICALLY INTERACTING SYSTEMS 3.1.
