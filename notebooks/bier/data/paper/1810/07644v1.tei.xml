				<p>The World Space Observatory for Ultraviolet (WSO-UV) is an orbital optical telescope with a 1.7 m-diameter primary mirror currently under development. The WSO-UV is aimed to operate in the 115-310 nm UV spectral range. Its two major science instruments are UV spectrographs and a UV imaging field camera with filter wheels. The WSO-UV project is currently in the implementation phase, with a tentative launch date in 2023. As designed, the telescope field of view (FoV) in the focal plane is not fully occupied by instruments. Recently, two additional instruments devoted to exoplanets have been proposed for WSO-UV, which are the focus of this paper. UVSPEX, a UV-Spectrograph for Exoplanets, aims to determine atomic hydrogen and oxygen abundance in the exospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. The spectral range is 115-130 nm which enables simultaneous measurement of hydrogen and oxygen emission intensities during an exoplanet transit. Study of exosphere transit photometric curves can help differentiate among different types of rocky planets. The exospheric temperature of an Earth-like planet is much higher than that of a Venus-like planet, because of the low mixing ratio of the dominant coolant (CO2) in the upper atmosphere of the former, which causes a large difference in transit depth at the oxygen emission line. Thus, whether the terrestrial exoplanet is Earth-like, Venus-like, or other can be determined. SCEDI, a Stellar Coronagraph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging is aimed to directly detect the starlight reflected from exoplanets orbiting their parent stars or from the stellar vicinity including circumstellar discs, dust, and clumps. SCEDI will create an achromatic (optimized to 420-700 nm wavelength range), high-contrast stellocentric coronagraphic image of a circumstellar vicinity. The two instruments: UVSPEX and SCEDI, share common power and control modules. The present communication outlines the science goals of both proposed instruments and explains some of their engineering features.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The World Space Observatory for Ultraviolet (WSO-UV) is a space observatory which includes a 1.7 m telescope equipped with instrumentation for spectroscopy and for imaging in the UV spectral range. The WSO-UV has a tentative launch date of 2023. The WSO-UV telescope can operate at visible wavelengths, thus allowing diffraction-limited imaging. Before the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and after the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), it will be the next largest mirror telescope for UV astronomy. Currently, the HST is the only space telescope with UV spectroscopy capability, but there is a strong possibility that HST will be retired by mid-2020 owing to other space missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). A future flagship space mission with UV spectroscopy includes the LUVOIR, which is under discussion as a mission concept study. LUVOIR will have much higher capability than WSO-UV thanks to its Ø 10 mclass aperture size. LUVOIR will be able to address similar cases as WSO-UV, but it is unlikely that LUVOIR will be launched before 2035, even if LUVOIR is selected as a top priority mission for the next Decadal Survey. Thus, there will be few, if any, opportunities for UV spectroscopy in the mid to late 2020s, even after a number of detections of nearby Earth-like transiting exoplanets have been made by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and other ground-based surveys. WSO-UV is thus an important mission which will fill a gap in the capability of space-based UV spectroscopy in the mid to late 2020s, and will be able to provide the most interesting targets for further follow-up observations once LUVOIR is operational.</p><p>To date, more than 3,500 confirmed exoplanets have been registered <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Most of these were discovered by indirect detection via stellar light periodic variability "transits" or via radial velocity (RV) measurements. Such RV measurements are quite similar to those used for asteroseismology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Other techniques to detect exoplanets such as "coronagraphic imaging," "microlensing," and "timing" continue to contribute minor numbers regarding exoplanet statistics.</p><p>The transit method enables detection of stellar photons passing through the rim of an exoplanet disk and therefore characterizes the atmosphere of an exoplanet. However, the overall ratio of transiting to non-transiting exoplanets is known to be approximately 1:100, or even less for telluric planets. The direct observation of an exoplanet under sufficient elongation from its host star becomes possible by coronagraphic imaging. This method has unique potential for studying non-transiting planets optically and directly. A coronagraph associated with a two-meter-class space-based telescope enables observations with diffraction-limited resolution above the turbulence of the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, the coronagraphic technique will allow study of non-transiting exoplanets, and hopefully, future telluric Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.</p><p>Stellar coronagraph development was planned in NASA's TPF <ref type="bibr">(Terrestrial Planet Finder)</ref> program, which has now split into three projects: TPF-C dedicated to coronagraphs, TPF-I dedicated to a multi-aperture interferometer, and TPF-O with an external occulter <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Several coronagraphic schemes have been elaborated, and many of them have been proposed for space observatories. In particular, JWST <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and WFIRST-AFTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> will be equipped with modern stellar coronagraph instruments. Several engineering runs to test the coronagraph in space have been conducted by Picture-A and Picture-B <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> experiments on sounding rockets. While the rockets follow ballistic trajectories, sufficient operational time is available to test the coronagraph subsystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. A follow-up Picture-C telescope is planned for a stratospheric balloon <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. All these projects are completing important steps toward high-contrast imaging in the stellar vicinity.</p><p>The stellar coronagraph, SCEDI, was proposed as one of two additional simple instruments onboard the WSO-UV (which is equipped with a UV polished telescope mirror of 1.7 m diameter). SCEDI's goal is to test the coronagraph as an in-flight demonstrator, to photometrically characterize several known giant planets detected by the radial velocity technique, and in the best case, to image exoplanets and circumstellar discs by searching several tens of nearby stars. Coronagraph design is proposed based on the common-path achromatic rotational shear interfero-coronagraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref> which introduces a centrostellar occultation effect under a variable angle for two-image superposition (rotational shear). Rotational shear is planned to be fixed between 5 and 10 degrees; therefore, the interfero-coronagraph will have low sensitivity to static low-order aberrations from a telescope's images.</p><p>Spectrograph UVSPEX is the other additional simple instrument proposed onboard the WSO-UV. Its goal is to differentiate between different types of rocky planets. Exosphere transit photometric curves in the spectral UV range of 115-135 nm can determine the abundance of hot neutral atoms of oxygen in exospheres. The exospheres extend to more than ten times a planet's radius. Because of this extension, exospheres are detectable at stellar distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</p><p>This communication is structured as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe the WSO-UV mission in general. In Sect. 3, we describe the science goals of the coronagraph instrument SCEDI and the UV spectrograph instrument UVSPEX spectrograph instrument. In Sects. 4 and 5, we describe the technical aspects and implementation of SCEDI and UVSPEX, respectively.</p><p>In Sect. 6, we include short miscellaneous notes on how these two different instruments are operated by a single electronic unit. In Appendix 1, we list the fields of view (FoV) of WSO-UV's telescope and demonstrate a solution on how to compensate for large optical aberrations in the off-axial FoV up to the level of residual aberrations in the axial FoV of a Richie-Chrétien telescope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The WSO-UV Mission</head><p>WSO-UV is a space observatory at geosynchronous orbit with inclination of approximately 40°, which includes a 1.7 m telescope equipped with instrumentation capable of carrying out spectroscopy and direct sky imaging in the UV spectral range <ref type="bibr">(115-310 nm)</ref>. The nominal mission lifetime is five years with an expected extension up to ten years. As the WSO-UV telescope is mainly designed for the UV spectral range, it operates at visible wavelengths, thus allowing diffraction-limited imaging. The telescope is a Ritchey-Chrétien reflective optical design with a 17 m focal length to access a field of view of 30 arcmin <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref>. WSO-UV will use the Russian NAVIGATOR platform from the Lavochkin Science &amp; Technology Association. The platform is a unified module intended for several missions including the Radioastron (Spectrum-R, launched in 2011), the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (the launch is scheduled for 2018) and the WSO-UV. The NAVIGATOR platform weighs 1,300 kg and allows for a payload mass of 1,600 kg. With its fine guidance system, the pointing stabilization accuracy will be ~0.1 arcsec within three-sigma. The bus provides 300 W of electric power for all instruments. The data downlink rate can reach 4 Mbit/s. The WSO-UV will be launched from Baikonur (Kazakhstan) with a Proton rocket <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. The geosynchronous orbit offers several advantages: stability of the orbit, continuous visibility zones, minimal duration of Earth shadow periods, and a continuous link between space and ground segments for radio communication. Earth occultation periods will be short enough so that the WSO-UV orbital period will allow long term monitoring and rapid access to targets of opportunity. The radiation belt, however, can affect the detector backgrounds. Thanks to the inclination of 40°, the radiation flux at high latitude regions is low enough, about five orders lower than that at the equatorial region; however observation periods must still be planned according to the radiation background.</p><p>The two principal science instruments are located in two compartments: a field camera unit (FCU) and WSO-UV spectrographs (WUVS), as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The FCU contains two imaging cameras: the FUV camera is sensitive to far-UV starting from 115 nm and the NUV camera is sensitive to near-UV and to the visible wavelengths. The WUVS contains three spectrographs: a UV Echelle spectrograph (UVES), a vacuum UV Echelle spectrograph (VUVES), and a long-slit spectrograph (LSS). Detailed information can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. The geometrical stability of the spectrograph is provided by titanium heat pipes instead of the previously planned CeSiC material <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. All heat sources inside spectrographs are connected to the outer wall by additional heat pipes. The cooling system for the detectors consists of a large external radiator and isolated heat pipe connected to detector cold fingers <ref type="bibr">[ 19 ]</ref>. Stellar spectroscopic studies that will involve WSO-UV are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</p><p>The most advanced unit of the mission is the telescope, which has already passed its vibration tests successfully, as well as a number of key subsystems, such as the guidance system, science computer, etc. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> The WSO-UV orbital telescope design view (left) with instrumental compartments shown (right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Science Goals</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">WSO-UV SCEDI Coronagraph: Aims, Resolution, and Contrast</head><p>The SCEDI coronagraph will attempt to directly image more massive and more distant planets from their host stars. The direct detection of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone is not the ambition of the SCEDI coronagraph.</p><p>The capabilities of several stellar coronagraphs aimed to study exoplanets are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Compared to the ground-based Subaru telescope (8.2 m primary mirror) with HICIAO coronagraphic instrument (used in the SEEDS program <ref type="bibr">[ 22 ]</ref>), and to the state-of-the-art WFIRST-AFTA coronagraphic mission planning to use the 2.4 primary meter of surplus telescope from the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) with CGI instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the SCEDI instrument onboard the WSO-UV 1.7 m telescope proposed in this paper can achieve a similar resolution as an 8 m ground-based telescope in an observing mode dedicated for dim exoplanets.</p><p>Moreover space telescopes have the potential to achieve deeper coronagraphic contrast.</p><p>A science goal for the stellar coronagraph onboard the WSO telescope is to directly image exoplanets and circumstellar discs by searching 20-30 stars near our Solar system. Planets and discs can be observed at multiple epochs down to 7-9-th order peak-to-peak (star-to-planet) coronagraphic contrast, which enables detecting and characterizing exoplanets down to superEarth sizes. As a minimum success scenario, the goal is to test the coronagraph as an in-flight demonstrator, and to photometrically characterize ~10 giant planets, which have been previously detected by the radial velocity technique. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> The known exoplanets distribution, the vertical axis is the logarithmic contrast (the ratio of luminosity of the host-star to exoplanet), the horizontal axis is the apparent separation between the planet and the host star, and color shows the exoplanets mass in logarithms of M. Rectangles show the observing capabilities using the HICAO coronagraph of the 8.2 m Subaru ground-based telescope (orange rectangle), the CGI coronagraph onboard the future WFIRST-AFTA 2.4-m space-based telescope (red rectangle), and via the proposed SCEDI coronagraph onboard the WSO-UV 1.7 m telescope (black rectangle).</p><p>A CP-ARC -common-path achromatic rotational shear coronagraph <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>, is planned (for the first time) as a coronagraphic device for real onboard observations, and it has a science-related advantage. CP-ARC introduces a centrostellar occultation effect under a variable angle of rotational shear. A rotational shear interferometer (RSI) superposes a telescope pupil and its rotated copy with an achromatic antiphase and results in destructive interference. If the angle of the rotational shear is rather small (fixed between 5 and 10 degrees), the nulling interferometer demonstrates reduced sensitivity to low-order aberrations from telescope optics. Because of WSO-UV requirements, a stellar coronagraph should be a simple instrument without the implementation of any adaptive optics system to correct the wavefronts. CP-ARC will be able to image an exoplanet by balancing the raw coronagraphic contrast and the spatial resolution (inner-working angle -IWA). Considering such an instrumental capability, we studied the CP-ARC in detail (Sect. 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">UVSPEX Spectrograph Science Goals</head><p>PROCYON with a Lyman Alpha Imaging CAmera Cassegrain telescope has observed geocorona images <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Images are formed from exospheric atoms observed from up to more than 240,000 km, which is about 38 Earth radii. The hydrogen density is estimated at 20 atoms/cm 3 at a distance of ~60,000 km in the Earth's exosphere. The same density is expected to be observable at distances of 10,000-20,000 km in Venus and 30,000-35,000 km in Mars. For Mars, the exosphere height can be even lower, and is caused by the difference of the mixing ratio of CO2 in the upper atmosphere. Venus and Mars have CO2-rich atmospheres with lower exospheric temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>. On Earth, CO2 is removed from its atmosphere by a carbon cycle involving the oceans and tectonics <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>. Translating these arguments to exoplanets within the habitable zone presents a possible marker to distinguish an Earth-like planet from a Mar-like or Venus-like planet. The expanded exospheres can be observed in UV during the exoplanet transit event in a primary eclipse, which reduces the stellar flux when an exoplanet passes in front of the host star.</p><p>Moreover, theoretical exospheric models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25]</ref> extrapolate these arguments to an oxygen exosphere. There are three oxygen emission lines (O I-triplet), the wavelengths of which are  <ref type="bibr">[ 26 ]</ref>. Although we can see Earth's oxygen emission lines in these results, they would be negligible using WSO-UV because of its high altitude.</p><p>Note that all other emission lines, e.g., emission line around 130.3 nm, were taken into account in the following calculation, while we excluded the 130.2 nm O I line (at which the emission is caused by resonance scattering from oxygen at the ground state), to avoid uncertainty in the cold interstellar oxygen absorption.</p><p>Then for the oxygen line, the predicted transit depths are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(c) evaluating whether the Proxima Centauri b exoplanet <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>, at which the EUV irradiation is much higher than Earth's, is either Earth-like, Mars-like, or Venus-like. The temperature of the upper atmosphere for Earth-like exoplanets is estimated to be 10,000 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>. In contrast, those for</p><p>Mars-like and Venus-like exoplanets are estimated to be 300 K and 600 K, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The transit depth at the line center for each case is 76%, 0.7%, or 3.8%, respectively. Owing to the large difference in the transit depth, Earth-like planets can potentially be distinguished from</p><p>Venus-like and Mars-like planets <ref type="bibr">[ 28 ]</ref>. High dispersion would be required to resolve the absorption feature in the O I line shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>(c). However, the total photometric transit depth of stellar emission integrated from 130.25 nm to 130.75 nm corresponds to 25%, 0.11%, or 0.20%, respectively, which are also distinguishable. As shown in Sect. 6, we selected a lowdispersion, high-efficiency design to observe M stars dark in the UV region and to simultaneously detect both hydrogen (~122 nm) and oxygen (~130 nm) emission lines. Note that hydrogen can be observed only when the relative (heliocentric) velocity of the exoplanetary system is high enough to avoid critical interstellar absorption. For example, the interstellar absorption of the hydrogen emission line at 12 pc is ~100% if the relative velocity is &lt; 30 km/s; however, the transmittance is &gt;~25% if the relative velocity is &gt;50 km/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>. According to the RECONS (Research Consortium on Nearby Stars) catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>), at least in the range of &lt;5 pc, there are seven M dwarfs with relative velocities &gt; 50 km/s, which will potentially be our observation objects.</p><p>In addition to exospheres, stellar UV, especially H-Lyman alpha emission, has a significant effect on photochemistry in the lower atmospheres of exoplanets. Recently, multi-wavelength transit observations have been performed in the IR and optical bands for constraining the properties of exoplanet atmospheres from wavelength-dependent transit depths. This type of observation is often called transmission spectroscopy. Although the number of examples is small, it has been already revealed that transmission spectra of close-in exoplanets are diverse <ref type="bibr">[ 31 ]</ref>. In particular, a likely candidate for the diversity in transmission spectra of close-in exoplanets is photochemically produced clouds, which are often called haze <ref type="bibr">[ 32 ]</ref>. Indeed, transiting planets that have atmospheres with hydrocarbon haze are theoretically demonstrated to</p><p>show diverse transmission spectra, depending on UV irradiation levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>. As the UV emission of low-temperature stars (i.e., M dwarfs) varies considerably with time, simultaneous observation in the UV and IR/optical range is crucially important and would yield valuable clues to the origin of the diversity, which is quite uncertain at present.</p><p>To summarize the UVSPEX science goals:</p><p>1. To distinguish an Earth-like planet from Venus-like or Mars-like by observation of its oxygen and hydrogen exosphere.</p><p>2. UV irradiation intensity, especially H-Lyman alpha flux, is important for estimation of the extension of the exosphere and also for photochemistry analysis in the lower atmospheres.</p><p>To realize exoplanet transit observations in oxygen spectral lines with the desired accuracy, we will equip the WSO-UV telescope with the UVSPEX spectrograph.</p><p>Science and technical requirements are discussed in Sect. 5. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Wavefront Quality Requirements for a Stellar Coronagraph</head><p>A stellar coronagraph instrument on a space telescope requires wavefront correction with extremely high precision. For the imaging of an Earth-like exoplanet, a wavefront with λ/10 4 rms precision (and amplitude inhomogeneity of 1/10 3 ) is required to achieve a desired 10 9-10 coronagraphic contrast, for proximity to the telescope resolution maximum (of 1-2 λ/D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[34]</ref>. A stellar coronagraph with an external occulter, such as TPF-O, and more ambitious projects to image exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[35]</ref>, do not require high wavefront quality (close to ideal), but they do require spacecraft in difficult orbits.</p><p>Present day technology allows manufacture of the telescope primary mirror with a surface figure accuracy not exceeding λ/10 p-v. This measure characterizes aberrations with low spatial orders. At mid-and high-spatial frequencies, the measure of power spectral density (PSD), which characterizes the level of light scattering, can show much better quality than the mean surface roughness (rms).</p><p>By means of adaptive optics (AO) by deformable mirror and by wavefront sensor, one can provide a closed-loop wavefront control within the desired precision (λ/10 3 …λ/10 4 ). In a remote space experiment, such a wavefront control unit requires additional volume, load, and onboard computational facilities. Nevertheless, the WFIRST-AFTA CGI is going to implement an extremely precise wavefront correction (ExAO) onboard.</p><p>In our proposal for the SCEDI coronagraph onboard the WSO-UV orbital telescope, we shall not use ExAO owing to simplification requirements and programmatic considerations. However, mid-and high-spatial frequencies of the telescope optics have small surface errors, so WSO-UV's telescope can work in the visible spectral band, where optical surface errors and scattering are reduced. Because of the requirement to have a small amount of scattered light in the wavelengths of vacuum UV (from 104 nm), the PSD in the mid-to high-spatial frequencies at visible wavelength λ=632.8 nm is prescribed below 1 nm rms.</p><p>In further analysis, we aim to propose an engineering solution for the coronagraph instrument under the conditions of existing telescope optics: a cumulative figure error of λ/5 -λ/10 p-v in the low spatial frequency domain and microroughness of 1 nm rms in a spatial frequency domain of 1 cm (100 cycles/m).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Principle of Achromatic Interfero-Coronagraph with Small Rotational Shear</head><p>Among the variety of stellar coronagraphs <ref type="bibr">[ 36 ]</ref>, the working principle of an interferocoronagraph is to superimpose (with antiphase) two pupil images being shifted, being swapped, or being rotated. Additionally, this results in destructive interference and therefore eliminates starlight received from the on-axis. Planetary (or companion) light does not interfere destructively because the off-axis tilt (or shift in pupil) separates the two companion copies spatially.</p><p>Interfero-coronagraphy is advantageous in terms of its broad achromaticity and, more generally, because of its small inner working angle (IWA). The AIC coronagraph is known to have one of the smallest possible IWAs, and it was first proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[37]</ref> with a fixed angle of rotational shear of 180°. Later, it was re-designed using a modified Sagnac scheme, implementing the common-path (or cyclic path) (CP-AIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[38]</ref> to relax the original mechanic instability.</p><p>A disadvantage of interfero-coronagraphy, known as stellar leakage effect, is that a star's light is not fully suppressed because of the apparent size of the star <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[36]</ref>. The observed star size is not directly resolvable; however, physically it is not a spatially coherent point source.</p><p>Observed by means of a two-meter diameter telescope (e.g. by the WSO-UV), the Solar-type star at 10 parsec has an apparent size of ~0.02·λ/D, limiting the destructive interference to 4-5 orders of magnitude for starlight suppression. To overcome this effect, an interfero-coronagraph with variable rotational shear, abbreviated as ARC <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref> (later re-designed in a mechanically robust common-path (or cyclic path) CP-ARC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>), offers the possibility to adjust the arbitrary pupil rotation angle to an optimal angle for the observing configuration. With a 1.7 m WSO-UV telescope, the 10 degree image rotating CP-ARC suppresses stellar leakage caused by a finite stellar disk for a Sun-like star at 10 pc, almost eight orders of magnitude below the raw coronagraphic contrast. This is a theoretical contrast without any aberrations.</p><p>In principle, a smaller rotational shear angle (5-10°) is characterized by a worse IWA and therefore a worse spatial resolution, as compared to the 180° case. With reduced rotational shear, the IWA increases and the spatial resolution decreases. Therefore, the coronagraph will have reduced capability to detect the companion in close proximity to the star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref> illustrates this dependency for the rotational shear angles of 180°, 10°, and 5°.</p><p>The throughput, T(ρ0) shown in the graphs was evaluated from</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">      2 / sin 2 / sin 2 1 ) ( 0 2 0 2 1 0          D D J T  <label>(1)</label></formula><p>(Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[39]</ref>), and describes the throughput of an interfero-coronagraph for a companion signal versus the observed centrostellar position ρ0 (in λ/D units) of the companion for different rotational shear angles ξ. with the lower sensitivity. This feature of rotational shear interferometers (RSI) is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">41]</ref>. As a result, an interfero-coronagraph with angular shears of 5-10° can achieve a significant coronagraphic effect without extreme wavefront correction. This effect can be realized within the specifications of the WSO-UV telescope, with the primary and the secondary mirrors together having optical aberrations of ≤λ/5 at λ =633 nm (at low spatial frequencies) and</p><p>with the microroughness at the mid spatial frequency of ≤1 nm rms (at a 1 cm scale).</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>, we show several simulation results for a classic interfero-coronagraph scheme to demonstrate (for the WSO-UV specifications) an almost disabled coronagraphic effect with a 180° rotational shear, and the enabled coronagraphic effect with 5° and 10° rotational shears. To simulate microroughness, the power spectral density (PSD) has been modeled from actual measurements that follow a slope approximately proportional to e -11/3 . For the low order spatial frequencies aberrations, we tested several random Zernike coefficients up to the Zernike polynomial order of 36, with the constraint not to exceed λ /5 p-v at 633 nm. Variability of about a half order in raw contrast units was evaluated. Microroughness was considered by PSD in the range of mid-and high-spatial frequency aberrations. Microroughness estimated by rms was set at 1 nm within the characteristic (cut-off) length of 1 cm (100 cycles/m). Variation of the exponential slope was studied from the declared -11/3≈-3.7 down to -2.17 (known for the HST <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[42]</ref>).</p><p>The raw coronagraphic contrast can reach a 10 6 -10 7 peak-to-peak value at 7-10 λ/D stellocentric distances. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>, the coronagraphic contrast was estimated by comparing a noncoronagraphic point spread function (PSF) and a coronagraphic PSF. The PSF dependencies were azimuthally averaged.</p><p>. We have estimated the effect of an extended source considering a 0.1 λ/D stellar size, aberrations, and micro-roughness. Without the two latter factors, theoretically <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">39]</ref>, the coronagraphic contrast is predicted to be better than 7 orders at a stellocentric distance 10 λ/D. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Coronagraph Sensitivity to the Pointing Error</head><p>The proposed interfero-coronagraph CP-ARC with 10º rotational shear is also less sensitive to the pointing error, as compared to the interfero-coronagraph having 180º rotational shear. The requirement on the pointing error of the WSO-UV fine guidance system is 0.1 arcsec (≈ 1.5·λ/D) within 3. We examine here how critical is this nominal 0.1 arcsec pointing error for the operations of the coronagraph instrument.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>, we can study the degradation of the raw coronagraphic contrast at stellocentric separation, where a companion is expected to be observed, versus the pointing error. For the pointing error of 0.1 arcsec, the raw contrast at 10·λ/D (≈0.67 sec. of arc) is shown as nearly twice degraded.</p><p>The factor of two is not a critical issue. However, the central part of the coronagraphic image detector, which is optically aligned on a centrostellar axis, receives an increased photon flux from stellar leakage because of the pointing error. So, the dynamical range of the detector is reduced and it may become saturated, which is a critical issue to be corrected.</p><p>The detector for SCEDI is composed of MCPs and a resistive anode, which is identical to that in UVSPEX (see Sect. 5) except for the photocathode material. The detector plane of SCEDI has 512x512 pixels, includes an InGaAs photocathode for the visible spectral range. The maximum count rate is ~20,000 cts/s for whole region of detector and the dark noise is &lt;&lt;0.01 cts/s/pix. The photon flux from the obscured star was estimated, it allows us to use the detector dynamical range to several orders for post-processing.</p><p>To preserve the dynamical range of the photon counting detector that can be dramatically affected by the strong stellar leakage caused by the pointing error, we decided to place an opaque mask in a relay focal plane, just before the detector. This mask was chosen to be ~6 λ/D in diameter as a compromise between the coronagraph sensitivity in that range and the amount of leakage.</p><p>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Influence of the Telescope Spider Mask</head><p>In the proposed coronagraph SCEDI 10º CP-ARC, one more source of stellar leakage to be evaluated is caused by diffraction from the telescope spider arms. The WSO-UV telescope has a four-arm symmetric spider holding the Ø 370 mm secondary mirror. Each arm is 24 mm wide.</p><p>With unblocked diffracted light from the spider arms, the coronagraphic image shows a raw contrast of ~10 5 at 10·λ/D, nearly two orders lower than it would be without the spider.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(c)</ref>, we plot the non-coronagraphic PSF (red line) and the coronagraphic PSF (blue line).

This assigns a plane, different to a classical Lyot-stop plane, conjugated to the pupil. Then, we simulated an opaque mask of the form shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.   7</ref>(b). This mask hides the image of spider arms using 2.0 mm-wide stripes. We then re-focus the resultant image in the photo-detector plane, where we study the filtered coronagraphic PSF.</p><p>The coronagraphic image with the proposed spider mask demonstrates the enhanced raw coronagraphic contrast (down to between 10 -6 and 10 -7 ), which is similar to the case without the spider arm effects, and is comparable to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(a) (b) (c) (d)</formula></div>

This optical scheme reflects the principle of an interfero-coronagraph with variable rotational shear. For simplification in flight, we plan to fix the rotational shear angle at some reasonable value between 5º and 10º. The image of the star and its vicinity is formed by the primary focus of the telescope. This image is collimated and directed to the interferometer. The light from the star is suppressed to reduce destructive interference with antiphase. The light from the two copies of the companion is not suppressed because they are geometrically separated. More precisely, companion PSFs become misaligned, because they are superimposed with the radial shear. then transmitted through the coronagraph. In the plane denoted by S1, which is optically conjugated to spider plane S, we have the spider arms sharply re-imaged (see, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 7(b)</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We have described an imaging stellar coronagraph, SCEDI, and a coronal UV spectrometer, Aiming to enhance UV astronomy, the WSO-UV orbital telescope will have primary and secondary mirrors working in visible wavelengths (within reflectivity &gt;90%) and allow good quality diffraction-limited imaging. The goal of the stellar coronagraph is to create an achromatic high-contrast coronagraphic image of a circumstellar vicinity in the visible band. The coronagraph will be an in-flight demonstrator, and will attempt to photometrically characterize several known giant planets. In the optimistic case, it will image exoplanets and circumstellar discs of several tens of nearby stars. The coronagraph will not implement adaptive optics because of the strict mission simplification requirements. The coronagraphic effect becomes possible at the expense of coronagraph spatial resolution (IWA). The proposed principle is based on a common-path achromatic rotational shear interfero-coronagraph. With the angle of the rotational shear fixed between 5 and 10 degrees, the CPARC demonstrates reduced sensitivity to low-order aberrations from a telescope's optics. The raw coronagraphic contrast can reach a 10 7 peak-to-peak value at 7-10 λ/D stellocentric distances. The coronagraph thus becomes less sensitive to the pointing error.

FUV irradiation intensity, especially H-Lyman alpha, is also important for photochemistry in the lower atmosphere. H-Lyman alpha (122 nm) and O I (130 nm) emission lines fall within the spectral range of UVSPEX, and if we assume a star with the same flux as Proxima Centauri at a longer distance, the distance of the detection limit for UVSPEX is 14 pc.</p><p>To achieve these requirements, a simple spectrograph design was proposed, containing a slit, a concave (toroidal) grating as a dispersion element, and an imaging photo-detector. UVSPEX's spectral range must exceed wavelengths from 115 nm to 135 nm to detect at least the H Lyman alpha 121.6 nm to OI 130 nm lines. The throughput of 2.0% is better than 0.3%, which can account for more than four terrestrial exoplanets around nearby stars.</p><p>At the current development stage, not all specifications are known for the entire mission, so the final performance will likely require modifications, but a baseline has been presented for adding these two options to the WSO-UV telescope.</p></div>

The concave grating is a laminar type with groove density of 2,400 grooves per mm. It has a toroidal shape with curvature radii of 266.4 mm in horizontal direction and of 253.0 mm in vertical direction. The effective area has nearly Ø 25 mm and the focal length is ~250 mm. The surface is coated by Al + MgF2 to increase the grating reflectance, and the diffraction efficiency of ~29% can be achieved based on its past heritage [46]. To achieve higher diffraction efficiency, a blazed grating is under development as an option. As a detector, we use a conventional photon counting detector with microchannel plates (MCPs) because it produces lower dark noise counts (typically ~1 count/sec/cm 2 ) than other sensors such as CCDs. This type of detector has been used in various space applications [49, 50]. The detector consists of an MgF2 input window, a CsI photocathode, a 5-stage MCP (V-and Z-stacks), and a resistive anode encoder (RAE). Although recently other types of MCP detectors have become available [51]</figDesc></figure>
