				<p>Context. The planet-star interaction is manifested in many ways. It was found out that a close-in exoplanet causes small but measurable variability in the cores of a few lines in the spectra of several stars which corresponds to the orbital period of the exoplanet. Stars with and without exoplanets may have different properties. Aims. The main goal of our study is to search for influence which exoplanets might have on atmospheres of their host stars. Unlike the previous studies, we do not study changes in the spectrum of a host star or differences between stars with and without exoplanets. We aim to study a large number of stars with exoplanets, current level of their chromospheric activity and look for a possible correlation with the exoplanetary properties. Methods. To analyse the chromospheric activity of stars we exploit our own ⋆ and publicly available archival spectra ⋆⋆ , measure the equivalent widths of the cores of Ca II H and K lines and use them as a tracer of their activity. Subsequently, we search for their dependence on the orbital parameters and mass of the exoplanet. Results. We found a statistically significant evidence that the equivalent width of the Ca II K line emission and log R ′ HK activity parameter of the host star varies with the semi-major axis and mass of the exoplanet. Stars with T eff ≤ 5500 K having exoplanets with semi-major axis a ≤ 0.15 AU (P orb ≤ 20 days) have a broad range of Ca II K emissions and much stronger emission in general than stars at similar temperatures but with higher values of semi-major axes. Ca II K emission of cold stars (T eff ≤ 5500 K) with close-in exoplanets (a ≤ 0.15 AU) is also more pronounced for more massive exoplanets. Conclusions. The overall level of the chromospheric activity of stars may be affected by their close-in exoplanets. Stars with massive close-in exoplanets may be more active.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observation &amp; Data</head><p>Stellar spectra used in our analysis originate from two different sources. The main source is the publicly available Keck HIRES spectrograph archive. These spectra have a typical resolution of up to 85 000. We carefully selected only those spectra with the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to measure the precise EQW of Ca II K emission. These data were accompanied by our own observations of several stars (HD 179949, HD 212301, HD 149143 and Wasp-18) with close-in exoplanet. We obtained these data with FEROS spectrograph mounted on 2.2 m ESO/MPG telescope (night 18/19.9.2010). Spectra were reduced with standard procedure using IRAF package 1 . These data are marked in all plots as red squares. We measured the EQW (in Å) of the central reversal in the core of Ca II K from all spectra using IRAF (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>). This plot illustrates a placement of the pseudocontinuum in our measurements. Advantage of using such simple EQW measurements is that they are defined on a short spectral interval which is about 1 Å wide. Consequently, they are not very sensitive to various calibrations (continuum rectification, blaze function removal) inherent in the echelle spectroscopy. For comparison, log R ′ HK index relies on the information from four spectral Cooler stars (T eff ≤ 5 500 K) with close-in planets are more active than stars with more distant planets. Empty triangles are exoplanetary systems with a ≤ 0.15 AU, full triangles are systems with a &gt; 0.15 AU and red squares are our data from FEROS. Middle: Statistical Student's t-test (empty circles) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (full circles) show whether the two distributions are the same.

If extracted from echelle spectra it is much more sensitive to a proper flux calibration and subject to added uncertainties.</p><p>The sample of the data contains 206+4 stars with extrasolar planets in the temperature range from approx. 4 500 to 6 600 K. The semi-major axes of the exoplanets lie in the interval 0.016-5.15 AU. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists the parameters of exoplanetary systems used in the study.</p><p>For comparison with our EQW values, we also used the parameter log R ′ HK taken from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wright et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Statistical analysis and results</head><p>We will start by exploring the dependence of the EQW of Ca II K emission on the effective temperature of the star. This is illus- Low probability values for T eff ≤ 5 500 K mean a significant evidence that the chromospheric activity of stars with close-in planets is different from that of stars with distant planets. Bottom: The same statistical tests performed on systems discovered by RV technique only. trated in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> 2 . One can see that the EQW decreases i.e. core emission increases towards lower temperatures. Part of the reason for this behaviour is that the photospheric flux at the core of the Ca II K line is lower for cooler stars than for hotter stars. At the same time, the data points which stand for stars with T eff &gt; 5 500 K show only a narrow spread of Ca II K EQWs while cooler stars have a broad range of these values. This means that we should focus on the cooler stars.</p><p>In the next step, we will distinguish between the close-in and distant exoplanets. This is also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> where planets with semi-major axis shorter/longer than 0.15 AU have different symbols. One can see that stars with close-in planets clearly tend to have higher Ca II K emission (lower EQWs) than stars with distant planets. To verify whether this finding is statistically significant, we performed two statistical tests on these two data samples (close-in vs distant planets). The first one was the Student's t-test which determines whether the means of these two samples are equal. The other test was Kolmogorov-Smirnov test which we used to determine whether the two groups originate from the same population. We selected a running window which is 400 K wide and runs along the x-axis (temperature) with the step of 50 K. Consequently, we performed the statistical tests on the two samples of stars within the current window and plot the result versus the center of the current window. The middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the resulting probability (as a function of temperature) that the two samples have the same mean or originate from the same population. Small value of probability means that the two samples are different. It can be seen (figure 2), that the difference between the stars with close-in and distant exoplanets is statistically significant for cooler stars with T eff ≤ 5 500 K.</p><p>However, notice that while most of the distant exoplanets were discovered by the radial velocity (RV) measurements, many of the close-in planets were discovered by transits. The two techniques may have very different criteria for selection of the exoplanetary candidates and especially the RV measurements concentrate on low activity stars. That is why in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, we included only the stars with exoplanets discovered by the RV technique into the statistics. On this reduced data sample we performed the same statistical tests as in the previous case -we chose the same size of the step and the running window. Even if the transit data are excluded, the tests show significant difference between the stars with close-in and distant exoplanets.</p><p>To verify the above mentioned trends, we also explored the log R ′ HK parameter. This parameter does not show the strong temperature dependence <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). When we distinguish the stars with close-in exoplanets (a ≤ 0.15 AU) from stars with distant exoplanets (a &gt; 0.15 AU) using different symbols we observe the same tendency as before. Namely, stars with close-in planets show wider range of log R ′ HK values than stars with distant planets. Cooler stars (T eff ≤ 5 500 K) with close-in planets have higher values of log R ′ HK and thus higher chromospheric activity.   The difference between stars with close-in and distant planets is statistically significant for T eff ≤ 5 500 K which is illustrated by the Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. The bottom panel of the figure depicts the same tests applied to the systems discovered by the RV technique only and indicates that the difference is statistically significant even though the sample consists of stars with planets detected by a single technique. In this figure, we used the same kind of analysis within a running window as before.</p><note type="other">T. Krejčová and J. Budaj: Evidence for enhanced chromospheric Ca II H &amp; K emission in stars with close-in extrasolar planets</note><p>It appears that the semi-major axis of the innermost planet around a star is in some way connected with the chromospheric activity of the star. So, in the next step, we explore the dependence of the activity on the semi-major axis a. This dependence is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> which displays results we measured -EQW of Ca II K emission as a function of the semi-major axis. Following our findings above, we selected only systems with T eff ≤ 5 500 K. One can clearly see two distinctive populations there. Stars with close-in exoplanets with a ≤ 0.15 AU have a broad range of Ca II K emission while stars with distant planets (a &gt; 0.15 AU) have a narrow range of small Ca II K emission. Again, we distinguish between stars with planets discovered by the RV and transit methods. Significant fraction of close-in planets was discovered by the RV method. Apparently, some stars with close-in exoplanets (but not all of them) have high Ca II K emission. Unfortunately, this finding may be affected by selection biases (it is more difficult to detect distant planets around active stars).</p><p>To verify the above mentioned behaviour, we also explored the log R ′ HK parameter as a function of the semi-major axis. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>. This figure also shows a clear distinction between the stars with close-in planets with semi-major axis less than 0.15 AU and stars with distant planets. Stars with closein exoplanets generally have higher scatter in the log R ′ HK values than stars with distant planets. This is mainly caused by hotter stars with transiting exoplanets. Once we concentrate only on cold stars with planets detected by the RV technique there might be a trend that stars with close-in planets have higher log R ′ HK values than stars with distant planets but it is not as pronounced as in EQW measurements. At the same time, there is no strong correlation with the semi-major axis for a ≤ 0.15 AU.</p><p>However, what causes the high range of values of Ca II K emission for cold stars with close-in planets? Is it due to its dependence on time? If yes, on what timescales? On the timescale of the planet orbital period, stellar activity cycle, age of the star or something else? Is there any other parameter/process which affects the stellar chromosphere? We explored whether it may be due to the eccentricity of the orbit but we did not find any convincing evidence for the eccentricity effect. If there is a dependence of the Ca II K emission on the semi-major axis of the planet, there ought to be some dependence on the mass m p of the planet (or its magnetic field) as well. This dependence would have to be continuously reduced in case of sufficiently small planets. Unfortunately, we know only m p sin i for most of the extrasolar planets. Nevertheless, we select all stars with temperatures T ≤ 5 500 K and with semi-major axis a ≤ 0.15 AU and fit EQWs of the Ca II K emission by the following function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W(m p , T eff ) = aT eff + b log(m p sin i) + c<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We found the following coefficients: a = 3.65 × 10 −3 ± 5.7 × 10 −4 , b = −0.392 ± 0.097, c = −20.4 ± 2.9. The a coefficient is significant beyond 6σ and temperature dependence is thus very clear. However, the b coefficient is also significant beyond 4σ and it indicates the statistically significant correlation of the chromospheric activity with the mass of the planet. We applied statistical F-test to justify the usage of additional parameter (planet mass) in the above mentioned fitting procedure. The test shows that the significance of the 3-parameter fit (equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>) over the 2-parameter fit W(T eff ) = aT eff + c is 0.003, which is below the common 0.05 value (2σ). The above mentioned results are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> where we plot the modified equivalent width of the Ca II K emission as a function of m p sin i. Stars with planets detected by RV and transit methods are marked with empty and full triangles respectively. Modified equivalent width is EQW corrected for the strong temperature dependence, namely EQW − aT eff − c. Lower values mean larger emission and thus more massive planets show more activity of the host star. Unfortunately, this correlation might also be affected by the selection effect that it is more difficult to detect a less massive planet around a more active star. RV data Transit data <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Dependence of the modified equivalent width of Ca II K emission on planet mass. Only stars with T eff ≤ 5 500 K and a ≤ 0.15 AU are considered. Modified equivalent width is equivalent width corrected for strong temperature dependence. By definition, the EQW is negative for emission. Consequently, lower values mean a higher emission and a higher chromospheric activity. Chromospheric activity of stars with more massive planets is higher than in those with less massive planets. Empty triangles -stars with planets detected by the RV method, full trianglestransit method.</p><p>T. Krejčová and J. Budaj: Evidence for enhanced chromospheric Ca II H &amp; K emission in stars with close-in extrasolar planets If our findings based on the Ca II K emission are true, than one can ask a question: how does this planet-star interaction work and why does it operate up to a = 0.15 AU? If it was caused by the tides of the planet, one would expect that the stellar activity would gradually decrease with a which may not be the case. We suggest that it may be due to the magnetic interaction which scales with the magnetic field of the planet. Magnetic field of the planet may be very sensitive to the rotation profile of the planet which is a subject to strong synchronization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bodenheimer et al. (2001)</ref> suggested that exoplanets with semimajor axis a ≤ 0.15 AU are most probably synchronized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>We have found a statistically significant evidence that EQW of the Ca II K emission in the spectra of planet host stars as well as their log R ′ HK activity index depend on the semi-major axis of the exoplanet. Stars with close-in planets (a ≤ 0.15 AU) have a generally higher Ca II K emission than stars with more distant planets. This means that a close-in planet may affect the level of the chromospheric activity of its host star and might heat the chromosphere of the star. This process operates up to the orbital period of about 20 days. Moreover, we have found a statistically significant evidence that the Ca II K emission of the host star (for T eff ≤ 5 500 K and a ≤ 0.15 AU) increases with the mass of the planet. The above mentioned trends may be affected by selection effects and should be revisited when less biased sample of stars with planets becomes available.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
