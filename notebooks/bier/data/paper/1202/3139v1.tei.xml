				<p>Extrasolar planets and belts of debris orbiting post-main-sequence single stars may become unbound as the evolving star loses mass. In multiple star systems, the presence or co-evolution of the additional stars can significantly complicate the prospects for orbital excitation and escape. Here, we investigate the dynam-ical consequences of multi-phasic, nonlinear mass loss and establish a criterion for a system of any stellar multiplicity to retain a planet whose orbit surrounds all of the parent stars. For single stars which become white dwarfs, this criterion can be combined with the Chandrasekhar Limit to establish the maximum allowable mass loss rate for planet retention. We then apply the criterion to cir-cumbinary planets in evolving binary systems over the entire stellar mass phase space. Through about 10 5 stellar evolutionary track realizations, we characterize planetary ejection prospects as a function of binary separation, stellar mass and metallicity. This investigation reveals that planets residing at just a few tens of AU from a central concentration of stars are susceptible to escape in a wide variety of multiple systems. Further, planets are significantly more susceptible to ejection from multiple star systems than from single star systems for a given system mass. For system masses greater than about 2M ⊙ , multiple star systems represent the greater source of free-floating planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Roughly one third of all stars in the Galactic disc are components of multiple star systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lada 2006</ref>) and the majority of multiple star systems are thought to be binary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Duquennoy &amp; Mayor 1991)</ref>. Further, as of February 2012, several tens of extrasolar planets have now been detected or are suspected of existing in binary systems. Some planets have been reported in systems with even higher stellar multiplicities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cochran et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Raghavan et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Guenther et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Desidera et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Mugrauer &amp; Neuhäuser (2009)</ref> provide a helpful list of known exoplanets in multiple star systems, as of 2009. In binary systems, a planet may orbit one of the stars in what is sometimes called an S-type orbit (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lowrance et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eggenberger et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Correia et al. 2008</ref>). Alternatively the planet may orbit both stars in a P-type orbit (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sigurdsson et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lee et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> ⋆ E-mail:veras@ast.cam.ac.uk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beuermann et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beuermann et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Kuzuhara et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Potter et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Qian et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Qian et al. , 2012</ref>). The latter case describes circumbinary planets, whose existence has been bolstered by the recent transit-based discoveries of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-16b (Doyle et al. 2011</ref>), and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-34b and Kepler-35b (Welsh et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, understanding the dynamics of planets in multiple star systems and, in particular, binary systems is becoming increasingly relevant. This understanding includes how such planets form, and how they die.</p><p>One potential avenue for planetary death is dynamical ejection as the star evolves beyond the main sequence and loses mass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Veras et al. 2011</ref>, hereafter, Paper I). Evidence for free-floating planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(in Lucas &amp; Roche 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zapatero Osorio et al. 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bihain et al. 2009</ref>) provides observational motivation to investigate this physical mechanism. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sumi et al. (2011)</ref> recently discovered 10 wide-orbit or free-floating bodies and calculated that 1.8 +1. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> −0.8 free floating planets exist per main-sequence star. Therefore, more planets may travel between stars than orbit them, and this vast pop-ulation of free-floaters cannot be explained by planetplanet scattering immediately subsequent to system formation alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Veras &amp; Raymond 2012)</ref>. In Paper I, the authors analytically described the conditions which can lead to planetary ejection from a single star. They assumed isotropic mass loss and demonstrated that three key factors must be taken into account. These are i) the mass loss timescale, ii) the planetary orbital timescale and iii) the total mass of the system. That study was limited to consideration of a single phase of stellar evolution for mass loss which occurred in a linear manner.</p><p>Here, we perform a three-tiered extension to that work by considering i) multiple stars, ii) multiple evolutionary phases and iii) nonlinear mass loss. Our primary application is the determination of the prospects for circumbinary (P-type) planets to escape as the parent binary evolves. Doing so provides us with the foundation to understand systems of higher stellar multiplicities, systems which often include tight binaries.</p><p>The physical evolution of a single star can, in principle, be described by just the star's initial mass and metallicity. However, the phase space of binary star evolution is significantly broader. In addition to each star's mass and metallicity, the separation and eccentricity of their mutual orbit (possibly including orbital variations due to massive planetary companions) are additional parameters which must be taken into account. The metallicities of both stars are often assumed to be equivalent because the stars are assumed to have formed from the same molecular cloud and not to have subsequently accreted enough planetary material to significantly alter their original <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> values. Our understanding of the physics of stars is not yet good enough to definitively link the above parameters with the wind velocity, the accretion rate on to the companion and the amount of spin angular momentum transferred between the stars. Therefore, physical properties such as these represent a further broadening of the potentially explorable phase space.</p><p>We focus our study by considering a single planet which is far from the parent binary (which may be tight or wide) and by analyzing the amount of mass loss from the system as a function of time. In the absence of mass loss, the approximately elliptical orbit of the planet will be negligibly perturbed by the potentially complex interactions between both members of the binary. In addition, such complex details of this star-star interaction need only be modeled to the extent that they correctly yield the mass-loss rate from the entire system. If the binary separation is large enough so that both stellar components evolve independently, then the planet's dynamical evolution reduces to the two-body case which was presented in Paper I, with the difference that the total system mass here is larger because of the presence of the binary companion.</p><p>In Section 2, we consider theoretically how planetary ejection is affected by multiple phases of nonlinear mass loss for systems of any multiplicity and establish a criterion for retention we use throughout the rest of the paper. In Section 3, we numerically simulate binary star evolution to identify which types of systems are susceptible to planet ejection and quantify where planets must reside in these systems in order to remain bound. We compare the binary and single star cases, and discuss the implications for higher multiplicities, other types of orbits, and extensions to this work in Section 4, and conclude in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CHARACTERIZING MULTI-PHASIC NONLINEAR MASS LOSS</head><p>This section provides the analytic background which motivates the numerical simulations in Section 3 and presents formulas which may be applied to other investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Phases, Regimes and Stages</head><p>Here we define our nomenclature. We adopt the same meaning of phases which is commonly used in stellar evolution studies. Stages are treated as subsets of phases, and regimes refer the evolutionary environment of a planet due to stellar mass loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Phase Identification</head><p>Realistic stellar evolution occurs across several phases. A sequence of phases qualitatively characterizes a star's history. We adopt the definitions of phase in the SSE ( We denote phase numbers by k. Within each phase, the mass-loss rate can vary. Therefore, detailed modeling of a particular system necessitates fitting mass-loss rates with a piecewise nonlinear model. However, doing so for a broad exploration of stellar evolution phase space is not feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Regime Identification</head><p>Instead, we seek to construct nonlinear mass loss profiles by a sequence of linear approximations. A key benefit of this approach is that we can utilize analytic results from Paper I and hence gain a better understanding of what conditions must exist for a planet to be significantly perturbed or to escape the system. Assume the stellar mass-loss rate is constant and equal to −α, where α &gt; 0.</p><p>In order to characterize the tendency of a system to eject a planet, we use the dimensionless mass loss index, Ψ such that Ψ ≡ mass loss timescale orbital timescale = α nµ</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= 1 2π α 1M⊙yr −1 a 1AU 3 2 µ 1M⊙ − 3 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a and n represent the planetary semimajor axis and mean motion, and µ = w Mw + Mp, where Mw represents the masses of all of the stars in the system and Mp represents the mass of the planet. We use the term planet to loosely describe a bound body of any mass that is not a star and does not perturb the orbits of the stars.</p><p>A planet is said to be evolving in one of two regimes depending on the value of Ψ. In the adiabatic regime, when Ψ ≪ 1, a increases but the planet's eccentricity, e, remains constant. In the runaway regime, when Ψ ≫ 1, the planet's semi-major axis continues to increase and e can now vary (increase or decrease) across all possible values. Therefore, a planet may escape only if Ψ 1. This bifurcation point is not exact. It is a weak function of both e and the planet's true anomaly, f (see Paper I). In fact, Ψ may instead be defined as αT /µ, where T represents the planet's orbital period. In this case, Ψ does not contain the factor of 1/(2π) that is present in Eq. (1). We will henceforth refer to this factor as κ.</p><p>If the planet is evolving in the runaway regime, the eccentricity evolution is a function of the eccentricity at the start of that regime and the planet's location along its orbit. For example, if the planet is close to pericentre on an already highly eccentric orbit, then the planet is ejected immediately. Alternatively, if the planet is close to apocentre on the same highly eccentric orbit, then the planet is never ejected. If the planet is on a circular orbit, regardless of f , it is ejected when the star has lost exactly half of its mass from its value at the start of that regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Stage Identification</head><p>Now suppose that within a given phase, the system undergoes N consecutive stages of constant mass loss evolution with mass-loss rates of α1, α2, ..., αi, ..., αN . Then, based on the results from Paper I, a planet experiencing i consecutive stages of mass loss in the adiabatic regime will have a semimajor axis and eccentricity at the end of stage i of</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ai = a0 µi µ0 −1 ≡ a0β −1 i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and ei = e0,</p><p>where βi ≡ µi/µ0 represents the percent of the original system mass that is retained by the end of stage i. Because eccentricity remains constant, a planet cannot be ejected in this regime (unless the semimajor axis evolution carries the planet out of the system), even if almost all of one or both stars' mass is lost. The mass loss index at the end of stage i is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Ψi = καi a0µ0 µ 2 i 3 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where κ = 1 or 2π depending on if the orbital timescale is defined with respect to the orbital period or the mean motion. Equation (4) indicates that escapability of a planet is independent of the details of the intermediate stages of mass loss provided that both µi and αi are known.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Stage-based Retention Criterion</head><p>Here, we describe the theory behind the critical system mass fraction lost for a given semimajor axis (Sections 2.2.1 -2.2.4) and the planet's critical semimajor axis for a given system mass loss prescription (Section 2.2.5). Computation of the critical semimajor axis will be the focus of subsequent sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">The Critical Mass Fraction</head><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> demonstrates that, at the end of the ith stage of evolution, the minimum fraction of the original system mass which must be retained to guarantee that a planet with a given a0 remains bound is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">βcrit i ≡ µi µ0 crit = κ 1 3 αi 1M⊙yr −1 1 3 a0 1AU 1 2 µ0 1M⊙ − 1 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Note importantly how this criterion can be written in a form which is independent of µi and ai. If βcrit i &gt; 1, then the planet is not guaranteed to remain bound, regardless of how much mass is lost from the system. Equation (5) demonstrates that a single short but powerful ejection of mass from a star at any time can unhinge a planet. If this event occurs late in the life of a star, when µi is low, the probability is increased. Equation (5) provides a useful way to quickly characterize an ensemble of systems. The equation holds for any stellar multiplicity. For single stars which become white dwarfs, the Chandrasekhar Limit can be inserted into µi. We may then determine the maximum possible αi that can protect a planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Visualizing the Criterion</head><p>We can visualize the limits on a planet's escapability through <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>, which can be applied to systems of any stellar multiplicity in which a planet's orbit surrounds all of the stars. The upper and lower panels respectively illustrate planet retention bounds when one characterizes the mass loss index with respect to the mean motion (corresponding to κ = 2π; Eq. 1) and the orbital period (κ = 1). The contours are values of βcrit i , and are a function of αi and µ0 for a planet at a0 = 10 4 AU. Figure 1. Criteria to ensure planet retention. Each contour represents β crit i , the minimum percent of the original system mass (µ 0 ) which must be retained by the end of an arbitrary evolutionary stage i in order to guarantee that a planet (at a 0 = 10 4 AU) remains bound. Different colours distinguish regions between 10 per cent differences in contour lines. In the upper panel, the mass loss index is defined with respect to the mean motion (corresponding to κ = 2π; Eq. 1). In the lower panel, the mass loss index is defined with respect to the orbital period (κ = 1). The y-axis, which has the same scale on both panels, represents the mass loss rate from the system during the ith stage of stellar evolution. The thick black curve applies only to single stars where the planetary mass is negligible compared to the stellar mass and represents the maximum fraction of mass retained by the star if it is to become a white dwarf. Decreasing or increasing a 0 by one order of magnitude adds or subtracts approximately 1.5 units to the values on the vertical axes but otherwise leave the plots unchanged.</p><p>Stars with masses up to 8M⊙ may become white dwarfs, whose maximum mass cannot exceed 1.4M⊙. Therefore, in the single star limit, the thick black curve denotes the Chandrasekhar Limit. Thus, in the upper panel, a 4M⊙ star which becomes a white dwarf has retained at most about 35 per cent of that mass during the transition. Planetary retention in such a system is guaranteed only if the mass loss rate during the transition is αi 10 −7.2 M⊙ yr −1 .</p><p>For planetary semimajor axes other than 10 4 AU, the plots are shifted vertically but otherwise remain unaltered. For every order of magnitude that a0 is decreased, the vertical axis values are increased by 10 1/6 ≈ 1.5 units. Therefore, for a0 = 10 5 AU, which represents a typical Oort cloud distance, αi is rarely low enough to ever guarantee protection of Oort cloud comets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Stellar Multiplicity Comparison</head><p>We can also extend the figure to selected multiple star situations. Suppose that the primary has just become a white dwarf but the secondary is still on the main sequence and is losing a negligible amount of mass such that M2 = M2 0 = γM1 0 . In this case, the maximum value of αi which can guarantee planetary protection becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">αi = 1.4M⊙ + γM1 0 a0M1 0 (1 + γ) 3 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>This equation describes a limiting curve which can be drawn on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> for a given binary system. Here, αi takes on an absolute maximum when γM1 0 = 1.4M⊙. Hence, the maximum possible value of the ratio of the binary to single star values of αi for a given M1 0 and γ is about 107 for the extreme bounds of M1 0 = 8M⊙ and γ = 1. For the vast majority of realistic systems, however, this ratio is about a few. This exercise, which could be generalized to higher multiplicities, demonstrates that the mass-loss rate for a main-sequence-white dwarf binary system needs to be slightly higher than in the single starwhite dwarf case in order to eject a wide-orbit planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Stellar Stage Comparison</head><p>In order to deal with generic systems at all evolutionary stages, reconsider Eq. (5). Because βcrit i is not explicitly dependent on the mass loss rates during the earlier stages of evolution, we can establish a critical value for the entire system evolution of</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">βcrit = Max (βcrit i ) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where i = 1...N represents the ith stage of evolution.</p><p>Comparing βi with βcrit determines the prospects for ejection. If βi &gt; βcrit for all βi, then ejection cannot occur. If βi βcrit for at least one βi, then ejection may occur. This is a general condition which may be applied to systems with any stellar multiplicity. In this work, we focus on binary systems, as they often represent components of higher multiplicity stellar systems and feature a representative set of physical processes that may be found in those systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">The Critical Semimajor Axis</head><p>Now suppose that a0 is not given.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Treating Nonlinear Mass Loss</head><p>Ideally, a nonlinear mass loss profile may be approximated with the finest possible partition into linear segments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Veras &amp; Wyatt (2012)</ref> achieved this accuracy by considering the duration between every SSE timestep as a segment. Although effective for a detailed study of one system, this approach might not provide a consistent measure or be computationally feasible for a population of systems. Hence, we now consider alternatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">The Theory</head><p>We compute α k by dividing the change in mass with the change in time over the entire phase k. However, in cases where the mass-loss rate changes nonlinearly within a phase, we can model the mass loss evolution within the phase by consecutive stages of approximately linear mass loss. We select the boundaries for these stages based on a coefficient of variation, Cv, of the data. If we fit a linear model to a given time series of data, then Cv represents the residual sum of squares about that fit divided by the mean of the response variable (the mass). An exact fit to the linear model yields Cv = 0. If we insist that each evolutionary stage satisfies Cv C * v , where C * v is a user-provided parameter, then the quality of our analytical treatment from Section 2 relies on the value of C * v . If C * v is too low, and a phase is split into too many stages, the resulting analysis becomes computationally expensive. If C * v is too high, and each phase is represented by a single stage, then the analysis may represent a poor physical approximation.</p><p>Suppose a phase k is split into l stages, where j = 1, ...l. Then Max(αj ) α k because mass loss from the system is monotonic and at least one of the segments of a piecewise linear curve between both phase endpoints is steeper than the original curve. Therefore, the limiting value C * v → ∞ does not define any additional stages and hence provides a conservative estimate for planetary ejection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">An Example</head><p>Consider the binary system with M1 0 = 5.2M⊙,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">M2 0 = 2.2M⊙, [Fe/H] = [Fe/H]⊙ = 0.02, aB 0 = 100R⊙</formula><p>, and eB 0 = 0.0, where the subscript B refers to the primary-secondary binary. Suppose both stars began life on the main sequence. This system undergoes 9 distinct phases of evolution such that k1,2 = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (11, 1), (6, 1), (6, 15), (11, 15)}. This sequence illustrates that M1 evolves off the main sequence first, on to the Hertzsprung gap and then the red giant branch. The primary's envelope is then blown away, leaving behind a naked helium star, which again begins a main sequence then Hertzsprung gap phase. The primary eventually becomes a white dwarf. However, at this point, the secondary is roughly three times more massive and is siphoning matter on to the primary. The primary is revitalized as a thermally pulsing AGB star, which soon after merges with the secondary. The new star continues AGB evolution until it becomes a white dwarf and dies out as such.</p><p>The mass loss for the k1,2 = (6, 15) phase is markedly nonlinear. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> shows the mass loss evolution of this phase for four different values of C * v . The latter three split the phase into stages. Phase and stage boundaries are given by vertical red dashed lines and brown dotdashed lines, respectively. The total number of stages throughout the system evolution that are generated for C * v → {∞, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001} are {9, 10, 12, 22}. The values of βcrit i are obtained from αi, which in turn are computed from the intersections of the mass loss curve with the stage boundaries. Displayed in the lower-right panel are the three highest βcrit i values of the many from that stage. Note that, as C * v decreases, βcrit ≡ Max (βcrit i ) increases. This must be the case because at least one of the segments of a piecewise linear curve between both phase endpoints is steeper than the original curve. The most accurate βcrit value is a factor of 1.86 greater than the least accurate value and corresponds to a factor of ≈ 3.5 in a0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">APPLICATION TO REALISTIC SYSTEMS</head><p>In this section, we attempt to sample the entire phase space of binary systems in order to determine prospects for planetary ejection. We first argue that large regions of the phase space may be treated in a similar manner. For the remaining regions, we utilize a proven binary stellar evolution code that can generate tracks quickly, without solving coupled differential equations. Finally, we present our results through a series of contour plots that provide information about features of the binary systems studied as well as useful parameters such as the critical semimajor axis at which a planet is guaranteed to remain bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Stellar Evolution Code</head><p>We use a slightly modified form of the BSE stellar evolution code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hurley et al. 2002)</ref>. This code utilizes empirical, algebraic formulae derived from observational sources and theoretical frameworks in order to model evolving binary stars. Although the code tracks a wide range of stellar parameters, here we are concerned solely with the mass-loss rate from the system and the physical reasons for this mass loss. We assume that the circumbinary orbit of the planet is always wider than the apocentre and common envelope radius of the binary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Phase Transitions</head><p>The phase and stage formalism described so far does not treat mass lost from a system during a phase transition. The BSE code computes the timescales and mass loss for most phase transitions. In these cases, we consider the mass loss between consecutive timesteps that encompass the phase transition to be linear. However, BSE treats some transitions as instantaneous. Although this approximation may be adequate for numerous stellar applications, such as population studies, here that approximation would cause α → ∞ and hence cannot be used.</p><p>In the single star case, the only example of such an instantaneous transition occurs during a supernova. However, for binary stars, there are several more examples. In a comprehensive sampling of phase space, each of these instances must be accounted for and a timescale established for each. We found that all such instances can be partitioned into four types of violent phenomena, i) corecollapse supernovae, ii) black hole core collapse, iii) thermonuclear supernovae and iv) common envelope evolution. In the following arguments, we assume that mass loss is isotropic and do not distinguish amongst neutrinos, ejecta and gravitational waves as separate sources of energy or mass liberation. Accurate modeling of these phenomena would likely require removing these simplifications and is beyond the scope of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Core Collapse Supernovae</head><p>Commonly referred to as a Type II, Type Ic or Type Id supernovae, a core-collapse supernovae is a stellar explosion of a massive star (of 8 − 20M⊙), typically while in a giant phase (k ∈ {3, 5, 6, 9}). The explosion leaves behind a neutron star (k = 13) or a black hole <ref type="bibr">(k = 14)</ref>. This event may occur in a system of any stellar multiplicity and the fraction of the exploding star's original mass lost is typically 50 − 95 per cent.</p><p>If we assume the tightest-known exoplanet orbit around a main sequence star 1,2 (a ≈ 0.015 AU) and the largest known progenitor mass which results in a neutron star (M ≈ 20M⊙), then no planet at any semimajor axis is guaranteed protection if α 0.9M⊙ hr −1 . This conservative rate is comparable to the mass loss timescales that are predicted from supernova ejection velocities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hamuy &amp; Pinto 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fesen et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>Such planets are likely destroyed by the progenitor during its giant phase. For planets further away, with semimajor axes of 1 AU, this critical mass loss rate decreases by a factor of about 544, and would be enhanced by just a factor of a few in a binary system, as argued in Section 2.2.3. Hence, realistic mass-loss rates from supernova would well exceed the critical mass-loss rate for any planet that could survive the progenitor's pre-supernova evolution.</p><p>Therefore, no planets orbiting stars of progenitor masses of between about 8 and 20M⊙ can be guaranteed protection under the criterion of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> and we can neglect sampling this region of stellar mass phase space in our simulations. There are some low-metallicity cases with 6 &lt; M/M⊙ &lt; 8 where the star might undergo core collapse supernova. In these cases, which correspond to kw ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} → {13, 14}</p><p>where w = 1 or w = 2, we assume that no planet is guaranteed protection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Black Hole Core Collapse</head><p>Considering black hole formation in this work is particularly important because all known black holes are found in binary systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belczynski et al. 2011</ref>). Progenitor stars with masses greater than about 20M⊙ typically have extended layers of high density which prevent mass from escaping during an explosion. Nevertheless, the progenitor still forms a black hole through core collapse. The amount of mass loss which may accompany this core collapse is unconstrained by observations and can take on any value. A theoretical upper-bound for the timescale for this process is 10 sec <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(O'Connor &amp; Ott 2011)</ref>.</p><p>This mass-loss timescale is orders of magnitude shorter than the mass-loss timescale for core collapse supernova. Further, no planet at any semimajor axis is guaranteed protection in a system with the largest theoretically postulated progenitor mass which might undergo core collapse and produce a black hole (µ ≈ 300M⊙, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Crowther et al. 2010</ref>) if α 0.015M⊙/s. Therefore, any massive progenitor undergoing supernova-less core collapse need only lose a few tenths of a solar mass to place any orbiting planet in danger of ejection. In a binary system, this amount may be enhanced by a factor of just a few. Hence, we can claim conservatively that only in exceptional circumstances is a planet in this class of systems guaranteed to remain bound.</p><p>This claim allows us to neglect progenitor masses of M 20M⊙ in our simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Thermonuclear Supernovae</head><p>Commonly referred to as a Type Ia supernova, a thermonuclear supernova is an explosion and probable disintegration of a white dwarf (k ∈ {10, 11, 12} → 15) owing to mass accretion from a companion. Although this companion is often a giant star, the standard model has subgiant donors. Alternatively, the companion may represent a white dwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pakmor et al. 2010</ref>). The velocity of the ejecta is comparable to that from core collapse supernovae but the total amount of mass ejected is typically less than 1M⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mazzali et al. 2007)</ref>. Despite this relatively low velocity of ejecta mass, the mass-loss rate is comparable to that from core collapse supernovae to within an order of magnitude. Therefore, because thermonuclear supernovae afford little more protection for orbiting planets, we treat planets subjected to this type of mass loss in the same way as with core-collapse supernovae and assume that the planets cannot be guaranteed protection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Common Envelope Evolution</head><p>Interactions between close binary stars resulting from Roche Lobe overflow may precipitate the formation and subsequent ejection of a common envelope. Details of common envelope evolution are complex (Ivanova 2011) and progress for greater understanding is being made through three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Taam &amp; Ricker 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Passy et al. 2011</ref>). Therefore, establishing a timescale for common envelope evolution, tce, is difficult. However, this timescale, tce, is thought to be within a couple orders of magnitude of the orbital c XXXX RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-19 period of the binary 3 . Even the lowest estimates for common envelope evolution timescales guarantee that some planets remain bound. Therefore, this transition cannot be treated in the same manner as supernovae or black hole core collapse. In cases where BSE treats common envelope evolution instantaneously, we assign a value to tce. A value of tce = 10 3 yr represents an upper estimate for this timescale and with this value we can establish a conservative estimate for escape. We also sample values of tce = 10, 100 and 10 4 yr for relevant regions of phase space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Lower Mass Extreme</head><p>We have argued that planetary retention cannot be guaranteed if at least one progenitor star has M 8M⊙. Now, we consider the lower mass extreme.</p><p>The lowest-mass stars (M &lt; 0.8M⊙) have a lifetime which exceeds the current age of the Universe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parravano et al. 2011</ref>). Their mass-loss rates are constant and negligible. By themselves, their mass loss evolution does not perturb a planetary orbit. However, in a binary system, their interaction with a more massive stellar companion could become a crucial aspect of their mutual evolution. Therefore, we include masses down to (M = 0.2M⊙) in our simulations below. For stars with masses M ≪ 0.1M⊙, planetary masses may no longer be comparatively negligible to the stellar masses. In that case, a less approximate treatment of the full three-body problem with mass loss would be required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Simulation Parameter Choices</head><p>Having restricted the mass phase space to 0.2M⊙ M1, M2 8.0M⊙, reduced the nonlinear fitting of mass loss to one parameter, C * v , and established the variable tce, we can now consider the binary's initial orbit in more detail. We treat both close and wide binaries in this study, with binary separations of aB/R⊙ = 10, 50, 100, 500, 10 3 , 5 × 10 3 , 10 4 and 5 × 10 4 , and binary eccentricities eB = 0.0, 0.5 and 0.9. Wide binaries which do not interact with each other typically have separations greater than 10 4 R⊙ ≈ 47 AU). Therefore, in the extreme case of aB = 5 × 10 4 R⊙, each component of the binary evolves off of the main sequence independently. In all cases, the planet is considered to be far enough away from the binary both to not affect the orbit of the binary and to have an approximately elliptical orbit around the binary. Each stellar evolution track is simulated for 15 Gyr, and we adopt κ = 2π in all our simulations. BSE contains several physical stellar parameters which may be varied. These include the accretion rate on to the secondary and mass-loss prescriptions. In order to focus our study, we use the default values for all physical stellar parameters except for metallicity. For most of our simulations, we adopt either <ref type="bibr">[</ref> </p><note type="other">values corresponding to [Fe/H] = 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01.</note><p>Throughout each stellar evolution realization, the binary's orbit evolves. The components may interact with each other in complex ways, including merging through coalescence or collision, transferring mass in dynamical, nuclear and thermal regimes, rejuvenating a companion through this mass transfer, and inciting accretioninduced collapse to achieve, for example, a supernovaless k = 12 → 13 transition. In all cases, the companions remain bound or merge. Only a supernova can unhinge the binary orbits. Common envelope ejection occurs beyond the binary's orbit, and therefore should not affect the binary orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Simulation Results</head><p>We present our results through a series of descriptive contour plots. On each, the x-and y-axes represent the initial mass of the primary and secondary star, respectively. We sampled each initial stellar mass at intervals of 0.2M⊙, such that M1 M2. Therefore, each plot represents a grid of 800 points. We can characterize many aspects of the system evolution with these plots, such as evolutionary complexity, timescales and mass loss factors. Our primary interest, however, is to determine the initial critical semimajor axis, acrit, at which a planet is guaranteed to remain bound to the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1">Dependence on Binary Separation</head><p>The initial binary separation, aB 0 largely determines the sometimes complex manner in which binary components interact with each other when evolving off of the main sequence. Because the planet is considered to be far from the binary, if acrit aB at any point, then the planet is not guaranteed to remain bound. The actual evolution of the planet in this case is complex and would necessitate detailed modeling. First consider the black contours: all orbiting material is protected from ejection for M1, M2 0.8M⊙ in all cases, and that this protected region is extended to 1.0M⊙ for the Solar metallicity case. For these lowestmass stars, their proximity to each other is unimportant. The lower panels of the figures demonstrate that in this regime, stellar evolution undergoes only a few phases; indeed, the stars never leave the main sequence. Even after 15 Gyr, the stars do not lose enough mass on the main sequence to have a noticeable effect on orbiting material. This is the only evolutionary pathway that provides safety for Oort cloud comets with a &gt; 10 5 AU, which are predicted to exist at galactocentric distances beyond the Sun's ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brasser et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Next consider the blue contours, found primarily in the widest initial binary separations, with aB 0 = c XXXX RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-19</p><p>Exoplanet Ejection from Dying Multiple Star Systems 9 The contours on the upper two panels represent the critical semimajor axis at which a planet is guaranteed to remain bound amidst binary stellar evolution as the initial binary separation is increased from left to right. Initially the binary has a circular orbit and solar metallicity, and we adopt tce = 10 3 yr and Cv → ∞. The lower panel provides qualitative detail about the evolution of the systems with a B = 50R ⊙ . The contour labels in the lowerleft plot are CE Only-at least one common envelope phase but no supernovae, SN Ia Only-thermonuclear supernova only, SN Ia+CE-thermonuclear supernova plus at least one common envelope phase, SN CoreCo Only-core collapse supernovae only, SN CoreCo+CE-core collapse supernovae plus at least one common envelope phase, Both SN-both core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. The figure demonstrates that circumbinary planets are highly susceptible to ejection. The lower panel provides more detail on the the systems with a B = 500R ⊙ . The total fraction of system mass loss over its lifetime is a poor indicator of a crit , whereas the total number of phases experienced by the binary hints at the reason for the vertical green strip at 3M ⊙ M 1 0 4M ⊙ . Although low-metallicity progenitor masses are prone to core collapse supernova for M 7M ⊙ , they afford circumbinary planets slightly more protection than higher-metallicity systems for wide binary separations.</p><p>c XXXX RAS, MNRAS 000, 1-19 5000R⊙ ≈ 23 AU. Comparing these two plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs  3 and 4</ref> demonstrates that the higher metallicity case generally allows for greater planetary protection unless M1 0 6.6M⊙, when a core-collapse supernova occurs. A circumbinary planet with a &lt; 1000 AU is guaranteed to remain bound if M1 0 , M2 0 2M⊙, although in many cases the planet may still be safe further away. This is the expected result from the single star case where mass loss is treated linearly in each phase (see Paper I), because at this separation the stars effectively evolve independently from each other. However, this treatment is conservative; later we demonstrate how one of these plots changes when C * v is decreased and higher accuracy is achieved. For aB 0 = 1000R⊙ ≈ 4.7 AU, planets with a &gt; 1000 AU may still survive if M1 0 , M2 0 2M⊙, as long as Cv → ∞. The contour plots for aB 0 = 1 × 10 4 R⊙ and aB 0 = 5 × 10 4 R⊙ are nearly indistinguishable from the aB 0 = 5000R⊙ case and are not shown.</p><p>For closer separations, the stars are more prone to interact with each other violently. The lowest-right plots in both figures hint at the complexity of the stellar evolution for aB 0 = 50R⊙ and aB 0 = 500R⊙. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hurley et al. (2002)</ref> describe the complete details of the physical mechanisms behind the variations in these contour plots. Here, we just point out some of the most important features.</p><p>When aB 0 1000R⊙, prospects for planetary protection are primarily determined by common envelope and supernovae events. The lowest-left plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref> characterizes where in stellar mass phase space for aB 0 = 50R⊙ these events occur. They fill almost the entire phase space. Any contours on this plot that indicate a supernova has occurred automatically yield acrit &lt; 5 AU (no protection) in the corresponding upper panel figure, as expected. Some contours which indicate that no supernova occurred also yield acrit &lt; 5 AU. In these cases, BSE computes a timescale for all phase transitions, and the mass-loss rate at some point during the evolution is great enough to prevent planetary protection. Now consider cases where 5 AU &lt; acrit &lt; 300 AU for aB 0 = 50R⊙. Because we adopted tce = 1000 yr for all these simulations, the variance in acrit is due to the amount of mass lost during the common envelope phase. Later, we will explore how the results change when tce is altered, especially to less conservative values. The green patch found at {4M⊙ M1 0 8M⊙, M2 0 2M⊙} indicates that the fraction of system mass lost owing to common envelope evolution here is lowest.</p><p>A conspicuous feature of the {aB 0 = 1000R⊙, [Fe/H] = 0.02} and {aB 0 = 500R⊙, [Fe/H] = 0.0001} contour plots is a vertical green patch surrounded by yellow and orange contours. This green patch arises because the common envelope in these systems is formed at a different phase of stellar evolution than the surrounding systems, at a phase where less of the system mass is lost.</p><p>Finally, the lower-left plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 4</ref> displays contours of the total fraction of system mass lost after 15 Gyr. The plot demonstrates that there is almost no correlation, except in the lowest progenitor mass cases, to the corresponding middle panel acrit plot. This comparison illustrates how the total system mass lost in a system is a poor proxy for acrit (also compare with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref> of Veras &amp; Wyatt 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.2">Dependence on Binary Eccentricity</head><p>Related to initial binary separation is initial binary eccentricity.

The plots reveal that acrit is relatively insensitive to nonzero binary eccentricities unless the eccentricity is high. In the high-eccentricity case, the plots resemble those obtained from smaller initial binary separations and circular orbits. This is consistent with the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hurley et al. (2002)</ref> that it is the initial semi-latus rectum, or angular orbital momentum, rather than semimajor axis and eccentricity which determine how a system evolves.</p><p>However, there are some differences. For aB 0 = 100R⊙, with the initial pericentre at 10R⊙, a bifurcation in the plot occurs where M1 0 + M2 0 ≈ 8M⊙, resembling the circular 10R⊙ case. However, the behaviour at {2M⊙ M1 0 4M⊙ , 1M⊙ M2 0 3M⊙}, is markedly different. The red patch bounded by this region in the circular case is caused by thermonuclear supernovae. However, in the highly eccentric case, the conditions favorable to producing this phenomena vanish. The resulting value of acrit is then dominated by common envelope evolution.</p><p>For aB 0 = 1000R⊙, with an initial pericenter at 100R⊙, the acrit distribution is lower than in the circular aB 0 = 100R⊙ case. The explanation again relates to thermonuclear supernova. However, here the high eccentricity of the binary promotes the conditions necessary for this explosion, thereby suggesting that for high values of eB 0 , the dependence of acrit on eB 0 may be complex and best treated on an individual basis.</p></div>

The primary differences occur for 4.0M⊙ M1 0 7.0M⊙ and M2 0 0.6M⊙. In this regime, no supernovae occur, and acrit is dominated by common envelope evolution.

The third discusses the limitation of our knowledge of some aspects of stellar evolution. In the fourth, we consider partitions of the runaway regime into multiple stages, and show that in some cases there exist analogues to Eqs (2) and (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Escape Rate Comparison With Single Stars</head><p>Observations suggest that nearly two free-floating planets exist per main sequence star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sumi et al. 2011</ref>). This vast population cannot be explained by instability-induced planet-planet scattering alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Veras &amp; Raymond 2012)</ref>. Other potential sources of free-floating planets arise from escape in evolved single star and binary star systems. Although a detailed ejection rate computation based on initial mass functions, binary fractions, distributions of binary separations, and semimajor axis-based planetary distributions is beyond the scope of this study, we can provide some qualitative estimates here.</p><p>The critical semimajor axis is given by Eq. <ref type="formula">(8)</ref>, which is applicable for any stellar multiplicity and a planetary orbit that surrounds and is far from the central star or stars. This equation contains the total initial system mass µ0. On the critical semimajor axes contour plots in this paper <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figs. 3-8)</ref>, lines of constant µ0 would be approximately diagonal from the lower right to upper left. Therefore, the tight binaries in <ref type="figure">Figs.</ref> 3-5 demonstrate that for µ0 2M⊙, a planet at several tens of AU away from the binary stars is typically prone to escape, and a planet at several hundred AU away is prone to escape in nearly all cases. In contrast, direct 2-body numerical simulations from Paper I illustrate that for single stars, for no value of µ0 does a planet with a semimajor axis under 100 AU escape. Further, at 500 AU, planets begin to escape at µ0 3M⊙. Therefore, for a given system mass, planets are more prone to escape in a binary system than in a single star system. This conclusion is critically supported by the lack of thermonuclear supernovae (see Section 3.2.3) and common envelopes (see Section 3.2.4) in single star systems. The bottom left contour plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref> illustrates that either or both of these violent phenomena occur in the vast majority of the stellar mass phase space for that set of tight (50R⊙), Solar-metallicity binary systems. In particular, the common envelope which typically forms for 2 µ0/M⊙ 6 values is not present in single star systems and promotes escape for all reasonable blow-off timescales (10 yr -10 4 yr). Even in moderately wider binaries, with binary separations of several AU, the stellar mass phase space is dominated by common envelope formation and ejection (see the upper left plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7)</ref>. If the common envelope blow-off timescale is as short as 10 yr, then the bottom right plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7</ref> demonstrates that nearly all planets, regardless of their semimajor axes, are prone to escape for µ0 4M⊙. In contrast, in the single star case, no planet under 100 AU will escape for µ0 4M⊙ (right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14</ref> in Paper I).</p><p>For the lowest mass systems, with total masses under one Solar mass, we can crudely estimate that planetary escape for single stars is negligible based on arguments from Paper I. Similarly, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figs. 3-8</ref> show that µ0 1M⊙ binary systems protect planets within 10 5 AU. These low-mass systems represent the majority of stars in the Milky Way, based on a wide selection of initial mass functions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parravano et al. (2011)</ref>. Therefore, we conclude that these systems do not contribute to the freefloating planet population, regardless of multiplicity. For higher-mass systems, as summarized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bastian et al. (2010)</ref>, the binary frequency of Solar-type stars is approximately 60%; this value increases to nearly 100% for O-type stars. Therefore, more stars appear in binaries than not for µ0 2M⊙. Further, as argued above, planets are more susceptible to escape from binaries than from single stars for µ0 2M⊙. Therefore, assuming that the number of planets which survive main sequence evolution is approximately equal in systems of all stellar multiplicities, the contribution to the free-floating planet population is greater in multiple star systems than in single star systems for µ0 2M⊙. For the intermediate range 1 µ0/M⊙ 2, the comparison of ejection contributions is less clear, because the binary fraction might be less than half ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bastian et al. 2010</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Higher Multiplicities and S-Type Orbits</head><p>A detailed extension of these results to planets on S-type orbits or to stellar systems with more than 2 stars is nontrivial 5 . However, on qualitative grounds we claim that acrit for both of those system types is generally lower than for the binary systems studied here.</p><p>A planet orbiting one star in a close binary is likely to be destroyed before entering a regime where it is prone to escape. Although a planet may briefly survive engulfment by a stellar envelope of a single star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bear et al. 2011</ref>), a planet residing in or near a binary common envelope would be subject to 3-body forces that would likely cause a collision. Similarly, a supernova by either star might incite a 3-body collision or escape if not direct destruction of the planet. A planet's orbit that is entangled in a mass transfer stream between the two stars would likely harbor a quite interesting but destructive orbit.</p><p>If the planet orbits one star in a wide binary, then stellar evolution of the parent star would extend the planet's orbit, possibly beyond a region of stability in the three-body problem (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Holman &amp; Wiegert 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Donnison 2009)</ref>. If the parent star explodes, the planet is ejected, regardless of the mass of the binary companion. If instead the binary companion explodes, then the planet and its parent star together will become unbound from the companion's remnant but could remain bound to one another. The planet's fate then depends on single star evolution. Now consider P-type orbits in systems with higher multiplicities. Examples include combinations of stars and possibly other planets which are all orbited by a distant planet in an approximately elliptical orbit. Formation scenarios in which a planet can form from core accretion in a, for example, circumternary disc, have yet to be explored fully. However, second-generation planets may form in a variety of exotic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Perets 2010)</ref> and if the claim by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sumi et al. (2011)</ref> that free-floating bodies are more abundant than main-sequence stars is true, these planets may be captured by multiple star systems. Although additional stars add to the total mass of a system, thereby inhibiting escape according to <ref type="bibr">Eq. (6)</ref>, this effect is overshadowed by the increased likelihood of repeated, violent mass loss events. Further, binary evolution represents the simplest-possible outcomes for closely interacting stars, and violent phenomena that have not yet been characterized may exist for systems of higher multiplicity. Many multiple systems contain binary components and thus suggests that as a minimum an orbiting planet is subject to the restrictions suggested in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Improved Physics</head><p>As researchers gain a better understanding of the underlying physical processes featured by BSE, the quantitative results of this work are likely to be modified. Particular events, such as common envelope evolution, are largely unexplored. Only recently has the dynamics of mass transfer in binaries on non-circular orbits been investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sepinsky et al. (2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sepinsky et al. ( , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sepinsky et al.

(2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rensbergen et al. ( , 2010</ref> find that the mass-transfer rate for low-mass binaries is never large enough to allow for mass loss from the system. They claim that matter can escape the binary if the kinetic energy from fast rotation plus the radiative energy of the hot spot exceeds the binding energy of the system. Mass transfer in cataclysmic variables might repeatedly vary by over an order of magnitude owing to nova outbursts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kolb et al. 2001</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Meng et al. (2008)</ref> considers the amount of mass lost for the highest metallicity stars ([Fe/H] = 0.04 − 0.1), a regime not treated by BSE. Recent hydrodynamic models of mass transfer between binaries <ref type="bibr">(Lajoie &amp; Sills 2011a,b)</ref> attempt to circumvent the limitations of the Roche lobe formalism, which was developed for restricted cases. Although these simulations are just beginning to tackle the complexities of mass loss in eccentric binaries, they demonstrate that some transferred material is ejected, while other becomes loosely bound.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Multi-phasic Runaway Regime Evolution</head><p>Investigation of the runaway regime might help assess the likelihood of planetary escape when Ψ ≫ 1. Nonlinear mass loss in this regime may be treated in a similar manner to the adiabatic regime in specific cases. By assuming that mass loss occurs in a series of consecutive linear stages, we may derive equations analogous to Eqs. (2) and (3). However, the evolution of a and e in the runaway regime is more complex (see Paper I) and we have derived analytical evolution equations only when the planet is assumed to begin and hence remain at pericentre or apocentre.</p><p>In the first case, for f = f (t) = 0 • , despite the added complexity of the relations, they couple together to cancel out all intermediate stage terms so that ai and ei may be expressed in terms of a0, e0 and βi only so that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ai = a0 (1 − e0) 2 − β −1 i (1 + e0)<label>(10)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ei = β −1 i (1 + e0) − 1,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>such that a0 and e0 are the initial values at the beginning of the runaway stage. Therefore, in this case, the prospects for planetary ejection are independent of both αi and the intermediate stages of runaway evolution, as long as αi is high enough to ensure Ψ 1. Further, as in the single stage case, Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> demonstrates that the fraction of mass remaining in the star at the moment of ejection is equal to (1 + e0)/2, independent of the details of the intermediate stages.</p><p>If f0 = 180 • , then the planet's orbit first circularizes before possibly expanding and causing ejection. The equations leading to this circularization feature the same cancellations, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ai = a0 (1 + e0) 2 − β −1 i (1 − e0)<label>(12)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ei = 1 − β −1 i (1 − e0) .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Hence, prospects for planetary orbit circularization in this case are also independent of both αi and the intermediate stages of runaway evolution, as long as αi is high enough to ensure Ψ 1. The planet becomes circularized when the fraction of mass remaining is equal to 1 − e0, the same result from Paper I. If we consider the mass loss to be instantaneous and f0 is known then multi-phasic runaway evolution may be treated as a consecutive series of impulsive approximations (see Section 2.7 of Paper I). We can then create relations linking ai, ei and fi to the same variables from all previous runaway stages before ejection. However, because the transition between the adiabatic and runaway regimes is not sharp (as partially evidenced by the presence of κ), attempting to link the evolution in both with the above methods would likely lead to an unphysical result unless the transitional regime is bypassed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>Multiple stars violently interact in ways that a single evolving star cannot and the effect on orbiting material is hence greater than in the single star case. Conservatively, planetary material residing beyond a few hundred AU orbiting multiple stars each more massive than the Sun and whose minimum pairwise separation is less than 100R⊙ is unlikely to remain bound during post-main sequence evolution. All Oort cloud analogs in post-main-sequence multiple star systems would be disrupted and feature escape, independent of stellar separations. Planets residing at just a few tens of AU from a central concentration of stars may be subject to escape in a wide range of multiple star systems. These systems may provide a significant contribution to the free-floating planet population.</p><p>The techniques we utilized in order to obtain these results may aid in future studies of individual cases (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Veras &amp; Wyatt 2012</ref>). We have shown that the prospects for planetary escape are determined entirely by the evolutionary stage with the greatest mass-loss rate relative to the remaining system mass. Nonlinear mass-loss rate profiles within a phase can be analytically treated by a partition into linear segments, where the extent of the partition determines the accuracy of the model. For single stars which become white dwarfs, specific constraints may be placed on the maximum stellar mass-loss rate given assumptions about an orbiting planet.</p></div>
