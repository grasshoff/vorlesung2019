			<abstract>
				<p>New transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (May 2009-September 2010) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly five thousand periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis which identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T 0 , and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (R P /R), reduced semi-major axis (d/R), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% for candidates smaller than 2R ⊕ compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2R ⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 85% for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1-Quarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1-Quarter 6). This demonstrates the benefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of all host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.</p>

This cumulative catalog is hereafter referred to as B11. Over 60 candidates from the B11 catalog have been confirmed, including many of Kepler's milestone discoveries: the mission's first rocky planet, Kepler-10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>), the six transiting-planet system, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>), the first circumbinary planet, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-16ABb</ref> ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Doyle et al. 2011</ref>), the 2.38 R ⊕ planet in the Habitable Zone, Kepler-22b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. 2012</ref>), and the mission's first Earth-size planets, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-20 e &amp; f (Fressin et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In this contribution, we present new planet candidates identified from the analysis of 16 months of data (Quarters 1 through 6). The analysis was motivated by the availability of the SOC 7.0 pipeline in the summer of 2011. Though only one more quarter of data was added, it was the first time that multiple quarters were stitched together to produce one continuous time-series as part of Kepler's pipeline transit search module (TPS). As such, we expected large gains in the detection of new candidates.</p><p>We describe the results of this effort -the data (Section 2), the procedures that sort transit-like signals coming out of the pipeline into viable planet candidates (Section 3), <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Quarters are defined by a requirement to roll the spacecraft 90 • about its axis to keep the solar arrays illuminated and the focal-plane radiator pointed away from the Sun. All but the first quarter are approximately 93 days in duration. In Quarter 1, the spacecraft operated in science mode for 33 days. and the subsequent vetting criteria that lead to increased catalog reliability (Section 4).</p><p>We describe the characterization of the planet candidates (Section 5) that begins with transit light curve modeling (Section 5.1) and ultimately requires detailed knowledge of the stellar properties. An effort was made to improve upon the stellar properties from the Kepler Input Catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brown et al. 2011</ref>) by utilizing theoretical evolutionary tracks as described in Section 5.2. We examine the distributions of the resulting planet properties (Section 6) and take a collective look at the progress to date as we work towards the identification of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone. We compare the observed gains to those predicted by way of adding three months of data (Section 7.1). The new multiple transiting planet systems are briefly described, as are the candidates in the Habitable Zone.</p><p>Finally, in Appendix A, we provide a cumulative table of planet candidates containing the characteristics of the new candidates as well as updated characteristics of the candidates in the B11 catalog computed using the same data used herein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>The data employed for transit identification were acquired between 2009 May 13 00:15 UTC and 2010 Sep 22 19:03 UTC (Q1 through Q6). Over 190,000 stars were observed at some time during this period. Of these, only 127,816 were observed every single quarter. Therefore, it should not be assumed that every star tabulated herein was observed continuously for the 6 quarter period. While this is a reasonable assumption for the Feb 2011 catalog (906, or 91% of the 997 stars identified as planet hosts were observed all five quarters), it is not for the population of new candidates presented here, where only 704 (76%) of the 926 unique stars identified as planet hosts were observed all six quarters. The last column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref> presents a string of six integers, each indicating if the target was (one) or was not (zero) observed during the quarter in question (ordered one through six, from left to right). The 4 th integer(corresponding to Quarter 4) can also assume a value of 2, indicating targets located on CCD Module 3 during Quarter 4. Module 3 failed at 17:52 UTC on 9 January 2010 and never recovered. Targets located on that module were observed for a shorter time period (see below). The start and stop times for each quarter are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The loss of Module 3 implies that approximately 19% of Kepler's targets will be observed three out of four quarters each year.</p><p>The data employed were taken at long-cadence (LC) whereby 270 readouts of slightly more than 6.5 second duration (6.01982 second integration and 0.51895 second read time)</p><p>are co-added to 29.4-minute intervals. Quarters 1 through 6 yield flux time-series with <ref type="bibr">1,639, 4,354, 4,370, 4,397, 4,633, and 4,397</ref> cadences (see also this is the number of cadences in Quarter 4 for targets falling on CCD module 3 (channels 5, 6, 7, and 8). Such targets were observed for 1,022 cadences instead of 4,397. Besides the interruption for some targets due to the Module 3 failure, each quarterly time-series contains gaps, some larger than others, due to a variety of occurrences including monthly breaks for data downlink, occasional safe mode events, manually excluded cadences, loss of fine point, and attitude tweaks. All missing cadences are tabulated in the Anomaly <ref type="table">Summary Table in</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> is sufficient for reconstructing the number of observed transits in time-series of any length.</p><p>Pixel data are converted to instrumental fluxes via Kepler pipeline software modules that calibrate pixel data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Quintana et al. 2010</ref>), perform aperture photometry ( <ref type="bibr">Twicken et al. 2010a</ref>), and correct for systematic errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Twicken et al. 2010b</ref>). The pipeline software is documented in the Kepler Data Processing Handbook (KSCI-19081) at MAST. As described in Section 2 of that document, each data set is associated with a software release number <ref type="bibr">(SOC version number)</ref>. For this analysis, Quarters 1 through 4 were processed with SOC 6.1 code, Quarter 5 was processed with SOC 6.2, and Quarter 6 was processed with a pre-release version of SOC 7.0. Specifics about the features of each can be found in the DRN at MAST that accompany each release. Note that quarterly data are reprocessed as new pipeline versions become available. Information about the data utilized herein can be found in Data Release Notes 4 through 9. We note that the Quarter 6 data archived at MAST may differ slightly from the data employed here since the latter were processed with pre-release software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Transit Identification</head><p>Systematic-error corrected light curves for all quarters under consideration are passed to the Transiting Planet Search (TPS) pipeline module to identify signatures of transiting planets. The functionality of this module is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jenkins et al. (2010a)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Tenenbaum et al. (2012)</ref>, and in the Kepler Data Processing Handbook at MAST. Before searching for transits, the software stitches together each quarterly data segment to form one contiguous light curve. To accomplish this, TPS removes a polynomial fit constrained to achieve zero offset and zero slope in the first and last day of each quarter and to ensure that the result is approximately zero-mean and wide sense stationary. TPS then identifies and removes strong sinusoidal features from each quarters light curve via a periodogram-based approach.</p><p>Finally, the gaps between quarters are filled via an autoregressive modeling technique to condition the time-series for the FFT-based detection algorithm.</p><p>Transit signals are identified using an adaptive, wavelet-based matched filter that explicitly takes the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the observation noise (stellar variability + shot noise + residual instrument noise) into account in formulating the detection statistics for each light curve. TPS transforms the time-series into the wavelet domain (a joint-time/frequency analysis) in order to characterize the power spectral density as a function of time and then correlates a transit pulse of a given duration with the normalized, conditioned light curve in this wavelet domain to generate a correlation statistic time-series that measures the likelihood that a transit is present at each time step. The single event correlation time-series is then folded over each trial period from the minimum (0.5 days) to the length of the data set to identify Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs): instances where a given period and epoch exceed the detection threshold of 7.1σ. Fourteen distinct transit searches are conducted, each using a different pulse duration (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5, 12.0, 12.5, and 15 hours). The maximum multiple event statistic (MES) over all durations is an estimate of the ratio of the transit depth to the uncertainty in the transit depth as a fitted parameter for the given rectangular transit pulse train at which the maximum occurred. At a threshold of 7.1σ, fewer than one false alarm is expected over the baseline mission duration due to statistical fluctuations. This defines the threshold for consideration as a viable candidate. Often, several of the matched filter pulse durations yield a detection statistic that passes our criterion (as expected), in which case the highest value is adopted. MES values are presented in column 14 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 5.</ref> 291 candidates are assigned MES values of -99 signifying an invalid value. This occurs when the period returned by the pipeline is not the final period derived from full light curve modeling. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> MES values of -99 also occur for the new "multis" (additional candidates 2 TPS usually gets the correct period for single transit signatures but occasionally chooses a multiple of the true period as the maximum, and is sometimes confused by light curves with multiple transiting planet signatures. associated with stars already having at least one candidates) identified by non-pipeline products (see below).</p><p>The analysis presented here stems from a TPS run used for verification and validation (V&amp;V) of the pre-release SOC 7.0 pipeline. It was the first time that TPS was run using the multi-quarter functionality. Such functionality was not available for the production of the B11 catalog. Long period candidates in the B11 catalog were identified using a modified Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kovács, Zucker, &amp; Mazeh 2002)</ref>.</p><p>TPS returned 104,999 unique targets with at least one sequence of periodic transits yielding MES &gt; 7.1 (i.e. TCEs). The majority of these TCEs are triggered by transients in the normalized light curves. Hence, the list is further culled by applying a second criterion based on the ratio of the multiple event statistic (MES) to the maximum single event statistic (SES) contributing to the MES. The single event statistic is the maximum correlation statistic in the time domain at a given test period. MES/SES should be comparable to the square-root of the number of observed transits. <ref type="bibr">Tenenbaum et al. (2012)</ref> shows that there are two distinct populations of TCEs, with a dividing line at MES/SES = √ 2. Below this value, detections are likely the result of two highly unequal single events as opposed to two legitimate transits of equal depth and duration. Discarding TCEs with MES/SES &lt; √ 2 reduces the number of viable TCEs from 104,999 to 4,531.</p><p>A transit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mandel &amp; Agol 2002</ref>) is applied to all 4,531 remaining TCEs, and the results are manually inspected to identify obvious false alarms and other astrophysically interesting signals that are clearly not consistent with the planet interpretation. The result is a list of 1,058 stars that were then assigned Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) numbers.</p><p>All 1,058 stars, as well as those reported in the B11 catalog, were searched for evidence of additional transit sequences. The search was performed by subtracting the transit model for the primary TCE, and then passing the residual to the modified BLS transit detection software. This yielded an additional list of 332 candidates associated with known KOIs. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borucki et al. (2011b)</ref>, decimal values (.01, .02, .03, ...) are added to the KOI number to distinguish between multiple candidates associated with the same star. They are assigned in the order they were identified.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Tests on the Flux Time-series</head><p>For each KOI, the even-numbered transits and odd-numbered transits are modeled independently using the techniques described in Section 3. The depth of the phase-folded, even-numbered transits is compared to that of the odd-numbered transits as described in <ref type="bibr">Batalha et al. (2010a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. (2010)</ref>. A statistically significant difference in the transit depths is an indication of a diluted or grazing eclipsing binary system. A similar metric is computed by the DV pipeline module as described by <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. (2010)</ref>. Each uses a different methodology for detrending the light curves (i.e. filtering out stellar variability), and both proved useful and are tabulated in columns 6 (modeling-derived statistic: O/E 1 ) and 7 (DV-derived statistic: O/E 2 ) of between the surface temperature and equilibrium temperature), the candidate is retained.</p><p>Eight KOIs retained in the catalog have a statistic outside of (negative) 3σ. In each of these cases, it appears possible that the occultation signal is a result of stellar and/or instrumental flux changes. This statistic is relevant primarily for short-period orbits where circularization is expected since the search is only done at phase 0.5. The Data Validation pipeline module checks to see if additional transit sequences were identified in the light curve at the same period but different phase. No such sequences were identified for the candidates reported here. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> lists KOIs (both old and new) that are V-shaped. The shape of a transit is not used as a diagnostic for rejecting planet candidates. The right combination of properties and geometry can, indeed, produce ingress and egress times that are a significant fraction of the total transit duration (e.g. grazing transits). However, a diluted eclipsing binary system is another possible interpretation and does not require such a narrow range of inclination angles (impact parameters). The false positive rate amongst the V-shaped candidates is expected to be higher than the false positive rate of the general population. A metric is constructed to flag such cases:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 − b − R P R</formula><p>. Negative values imply that the purported planet is not fully covering the stellar disk at mid-transit. The closer the number is to −2 × R P R , the more severely it is grazing. A grazing geometry is required to model V-shaped transits that are not caused by a large planet-to-star size ratio. The KOIs with light curves modeled as grazing transits are listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> together with the orbital period and reduced radius.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Tests on the Pixel Data</head><p>A major source of false-positive planetary candidates in the Kepler data is a background eclipsing binary (BGEB) star within the photometric aperture of a Kepler target star.</p><p>These BGEBs, when diluted by a target star, can produce mimic a planetary transit signal.</p><p>Two methods are used to detect such BGEBs by using the Kepler pixels to determine the location of the object causing the transit signal: direct measurement of the source location via difference image analysis and inference of the source location from photo-center motion associated with the transits.</p><p>Photo-center motion is measured by computing the flux-weighted centroid of all pixels downlinked for a given star both in and out of transit (the times of which differ for each candidate associated with a given star). The computation of the flux centroids for KOIs that were processed with the SOC pipeline Data Validation module is done per cadence, and the centroid offset when in transit is computed as the amplitude of a joint multi-quarter least-squares fit to the transit model generated by the SOC pipeline ( <ref type="bibr">Wu et al. 2010</ref>). For those targets that were not processed by DV, the flux centroid offset is computed for the quarterly average out-of-transit and in-transit pixel images. In this latter case, the centroid offsets are computed by subtracting the out-of-transit centroid from the in-transit centroid, and the quarterly offsets are averaged as described below. Once the in-transit centroid offset is computed, the source location is then inferred by scaling the difference of these two centroids by the inverse of the flux as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jenkins et al. (2010b)</ref>. In principle, both the photo-center motion and difference image techniques are similarly accurate for isolated stars and sufficiently high SNR transits, but the techniques have different responses to systematic error sources such as field crowding. The photo-center method is more sensitive to noise for low SNR transits and crowding by field stars. In particular, the estimate of the transit source location by scaling the offset is highly sensitive to incompletely captured flux for either the target star or field stars in the aperture.</p><p>In the difference image method, the PRF fit to the difference and out-of-transit pixel images is biased by PRF errors described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bryson et al. (2010)</ref>, as well as errors due to crowding. Defining the centroid offset as the difference between the out-of-transit and difference images nearly cancels the PRF bias because both fits are subject to the same error. Bias due to crowding, however, is more of an issue. Excepting cases in which Both bias types vary from quarter to quarter. A study of a large number of targets indicates that the combined biases have an approximately zero-mean distribution across quarters, so we can reduce their impact by averaging the quarterly centroid measurements across quarters. We compute this average by performing a 0 th order (constant) polynomial robust χ 2 minimizing fit to the quarterly results. This approach produces an uncertainty that takes into account both the uncertainty of the individual quarterly observations as well as their scatter due to bias across quarters. An example set of quarterly measurements and the resulting average is shown in the left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. This method works best for short-period candidates, where there are many transits in all quarters. This method is less effective in reducing the centroid bias for long-period candidates. In particular, single-transit candidates that appear in only one quarter may have unknown biases in their centroid positions that are not accounted for in the centroid uncertainties.</p><p>The above centroid analysis was performed using data from Quarters 1 through 8. The transit source location offsets reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 5</ref> are from the difference image method since it is more reliable as evidenced by consistently smaller uncertainties compared to the photo-center motion method. A candidate passes the photo-center vetting step when its multi-quarter transit source offset is less than 3σ. There are, however, exceptions. KOIs having transit source offsets larger than 3σ were identified as having systematic errors (e.g. crowding biases) that are likely causing the large apparent offset. Modeling efforts to confirm these systematics are currently underway.</p><p>In some cases, the PRF fit algorithm failed, typically due to low quarterly SNR or to bright field stars that prevented reliable determination of the target star location via PRF fit. We retain these targets when visual inspection of the difference image indicates that the change in flux due to the transit is on the target star. Finally, difference imaging is very inaccurate for saturated targets, and we retain saturated candidates for which the difference images show no obvious indication of a background source. Offset values for slightly saturated stars (Kp between 10.5 and 11.5) are likely accurate to within 4 (one pixel), while offset values for highly saturated stars (Kp &lt; 10.5) should be disregarded.</p><p>Transit source offset values are set to -99 when we feel that the centroid measurement is unreliable.</p></div>

An integer value of 0, 1, or 2 was assigned to each metric to indicate if the test clearly passed (0), was ambiguous (1), or clearly failed (2). A similar flag was ascribed to the visual appearance, where examples of suspicious characteristics would include markedly V-shaped transits, red noise and/or outliers in the time-series calling into question the reliability of the transit signal, anomalously long transit durations, poor light curve fits, obvious secondaries, etc. Each candidate was then designated "yes", "no", or "maybe".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Model Fitting</head><p>For each KOI, a transit model was fit to the data. The transit model uses the analytic formulae of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> to model the transit and a Keplerian orbit to model the orbital phase. The model fits for the mean stellar density (ρ ), center of transit (T 0 ), orbital period (P ), scaled planetary radius (R P /R ), impact parameter (b) and occultation (secondary) depth (at phase=0.5). In the case of multiple transiting candidates the orbits were assumed to be non-interacting and T 0 , P , b and the occultation depth were fit for each candidate.</p><p>The assumption is made that all candidates in the same system orbit the same star modeled by ρ and that the total mass of the companion is much less than the mass of the central star. For a Jupiter-mass companion, an error of 0.02% will be incurred on the measurement of ρ , a 0.1 M companion would skew our estimate of ρ by approximately 2%, and a 0.5 M companion would induce a systematic error of 41% on ρ .</p><p>These assumptions give:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">a R 3 π 3GP 2 = (M + M p ) 4π 3 R 3 ≈ M 4π 3 R 3 = ρ ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a/R is the reduced semi-major axis. The orbits were assumed to be circular, thus the transit is only sensitive to the planet-star separation for a small portion of the orbit and in general is not a true determination of ρ or a/R . As such, we purposely report d/R which is the ratio of the planet-star separation during transit to the stellar radius. It is equivalent to a/R for the case of zero eccentricity. A full orbital solution is required to correctly determine stellar parameters from transit modeling. Great care must be taken when interpreting the fitted stellar parameters. A mismatch between the reported stellar parameters and a transit-derived stellar parameter can be interpreted as evidence of: an eccentric orbit, erroneous stellar classification or a transiting companion with significant mass. One is not able to distinguish among these three cases using the model parameters provided. Best fit model parameters were determined by computing a least-squares chi-squared search using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Press et al. 1992</ref>). Derivatives were numerically determined. Uncertainties are taken from the diagonal elements of the formal covariance matrix corresponding to each fitted parameter. They do not account for correlated errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Stellar Parameters</head><p>Output parameters from light curve modeling can be used to compute the radius, semi-major axis, and equilibrium temperature of each planet candidate given knowledge of the stellar surface temperature, radius, and mass. These and other stellar properties for the host stars are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref>. Stellar coordinates and the apparent magnitude in the The Kepler Input Catalog has been a valuable resource for the stellar properties necessary for characterizing Kepler's planet candidates (e.g. T eff , log g, and R ). However, there are parameters in the KIC that imply populations that are inconsistent with stellar theory and observation. For example, G-type stars with log g ≈ 5 (i.e. well below the main-sequence) are not uncommon in the KIC. While the uncertainty on the determination of log g shows that such a star is consistent with being near the main-sequence, using such stellar parameters results in small stellar and planetary radii and an underestimation of incident flux on the planet candidate. We systematically correct such populations in the KIC by matching T eff , log g and [Fe/H] to the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Demarque et al. 2004</ref>). We find the closest match based on minimization of:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">χ 2 = δT eff σ T eff 2 + δ log g σ log g 2 + δ[Fe/H] σ [Fe/H] 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where δ represents the difference in the KIC and Yonsei-Yale parameter and σ is the adopted uncertainty in the KIC parameter. We adopted σ T eff = 200 K, σ log g = 0.3 and σ [Fe/H] = 0.4 and required the modeled age to be less than 14 Gyr. For each star we adopt the model-determined mass and radius. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">Figure 2</ref> shows T eff and log g.

These stars have</p><p>T eff from roughly 4500 K to 6500 K.

However, modeled masses and radii are highly uncertain in this temperature range and should be used with caution. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(3)</ref> There is a population of stars which have KIC log g near 4.1 and T eff near 5000 K.

The stellar mass is derived directly from the surface gravity and stellar radius (column 8 and 9 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 3</ref>). We note that, despite the name, the product of the reduced semi-major axis, d/R (column 9) and the stellar radius will not yield a reliable estimate of the semi-major axis of the orbit. The reduced semi-major axis is a parameter derived from light curve modeling assuming zero eccentricity. More specifically, it is the ratio of the star-planet separation at the time of transit to the stellar radius. Only for the special case of either zero eccentricity or alignment of the periastron with the line of sight is it equivalent to the ratio of the semi-major axis to the stellar radius. Similarly, there is a direct relationship between a/R and the stellar density (see Equation 1) as described in <ref type="bibr">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Period Aliasing</head><p>Section 4 describes the vetting procedures and the many metrics used to eliminate false positives. One of the statistics is a measure of the significance of odd/even depth differences. Aside from identifying eclipsing binaries, the metric can also be used as a warning that a low-SNR planetary period is a factor of two too low (as for KOI-730.03 and 191.04; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lissauer et al. 2011b</ref>). As an additional step outside the general procedures, we constructed a similar statistic for comparing the depths of every third or fourth transit.</p><p>In this manner, the period of KOI-1445.02 was found to be a factor of three larger than initially determined (54 days compared to 18 days as determined the the pipeline). <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> contains the updated period value. In this exercise we identified a handful of other planet candidates with low SNR, primarily based on one or two transits each 3 , with ephemerides predicting transits that are not detected. When only two transits are seen, it is possible that each transit belongs to different planets that each only transit once, or, alternatively, that they are the primary and secondary eclipse of an eccentric, long-period, blended eclipsing binary. In some cases, there may be an alternative orbital period that phases the observed transits with a gap in the data take. More observations are required to determine a unique solution. These period aliases show that while the catalog is generally of high reliability, additional analyses on the light-curves of low-SNR transits may generate revisions.</p></div>

To do so, we express the total SNR of a transit event of a given depth, duration, and period associated with a star of specified characteristics as a detection probability. We construct a grid of such probabilities for our hypothetical star as a function of transit depth and orbital period.</p><p>There is a unique transit duration associated with each point in the grid, computed by assuming a zero-eccentricity Keplerian orbit. Knowledge of the duration is necessary for establishing the total SNR. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 5</ref> shows a sample grid for a typical Kp=12 magnitude star assuming five quarters of observations (407 days) and a 95% duty cycle.

We can then integrate over period and radius to obtain the planet yields in specific bins.  As such, the analysis did not make full use of the pipeline modules that carefully treat inter-quarter boundaries and perform the pre-search whitening of the light curves as described in Section 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary</head><p>We have analyzed pipeline results using Q1 through Q6 data. Nearly 5,000 TCEs were evaluated. Approximately 1,500 were identified as objects of interest. Light curve modeling, Data Validation pipeline results, and photo-center analysis yield metrics for vetting astrophysical false positives. The vetting process yielded nearly 700 new planet candidates. These as well as previous candidates were subjected to a modified BLS transit detection analysis after filtering the primary transit events. More than 300 additional candidates associated with multiple systems were identified in this way and subjected to the same vetting metrics. Jupiter-size, respectively.</p><p>The distribution in both size and orbital period of the new candidates is qualitatively similar to that of the previously published candidates, although smaller planets are more prevalent. More than 91% of the new planet candidates are smaller than Neptune (compared to 73% for the B11 catalog). The largest relative gains are seen not only for the smaller planets but also for those at longer orbital periods. We report a growth of 197%</p><p>for candidates smaller than 2R ⊕ , compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2R ⊕ , and a growth of 123% for orbital period longer than 50 days compared to an 85% increase for periods shorter than 50 days. The gains for the smaller planets cannot be explained by the modest increase in data collection. The observed gains exceed the computed gains even in regimes where one might expect previous catalogs to be complete <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 7)</ref>. This can be explained by improvements to the analysis pipeline, the most significant of which is the multi-quarter capability in the Transiting Planet Search and Data Validation modules. With each successive catalog, we see clear progress toward the Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Figures 3 and 9)</ref>. Twenty-five of the new candidates are located in the range 185 K &lt; T eq &lt; 303 K, and one, KOI-2124.01, is near Earth-size and at the hot end of this temperature range. The gains in the number of detections of planet candidates smaller than 2R ⊕ will be a boon for studying occurrence rates. We proceed cautiously, however. </p></div>

Barring pixel-level systematics and field-star variability, the pixels with the highest flux in the difference image form a star image at the location of the transiting object, with flux level equal to the fractional depth of the transit times the original flux of the star. Performing a fit of the Kepler pixel response function (PRF) (Bryson et al. 2010) to both the average difference and out-of-transit images gives the sky location of the transit source and the target star. The offset of the transit source from the target star is then defined as the transit source minus target star location. For most KOIs, the difference image offset is computed per quarter, and the quarterly offsets are averaged as described below. For a small number of KOIs with very low SNR, a computationally expensive joint multi-quarter fit is performed, with uncertainties estimated via a bootstrap analysis.</figDesc></figure>

Approximately 20 targets within 20 of an existing KOI or EB with the same orbital period (to within 5 minutes) were identified. In this manner, we also identified two small swarms of spatially co-located stars, each with a transit-like event at the same period of its neighbors. The lack of sizable photo-center motion and the spatial extent of the contaminating flux suggests that scattered light (e.g. an optical ghost from a bright Eclipsing Binary at the focal plane anti-podal position) is responsible. Every one of the 1 390 KOIs evaluated here will appear either in this contribution as a viable planet candidates, or in the associated false positive catalog (Bryson et al. 2012), or in future versions of the Eclipsing Binary Catalog.</figDesc></figure>

Not surprisingly, each successive catalog contains progressively smaller planet candidates at progressively longer orbital periods.

The plot corroborates the observation made by Latham et al. (2011) in studying the multis in the B11 catalog: that there is a paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems. There is only one apparent exception to this -the green point near R P = 17R ⊕ , P = 3 days (KOI-338.02). This is a new candidate associated with KOI-338, the first having been reported in the B11 catalog. Since that publication, spectroscopic observations have been acquired and subjected to spectral synthesis. The revised stellar parameters are T eff = 4104 K and log g = 1.87 compared to T eff = 4910 K and log g = 4.18 in the Kepler Input Catalog. This results in a significant change in the estimated planet radius for KOI-338.01 reported in B11. Re-evaluation of KOI-338.01 with the new stellar radius consistent with the lower surface gravity yields R P = 40R ⊕ . This transiting (eclipsing) object is too large to be planetary and is off the scale in Figure 8. The new candidate, KOI-338.02, is approximately Jupiter-size. A second spectroscopic observation from the same instrument (the TRES spectrograph on the Tillinghast Reflector at Whipple Observatory) was acquired, and yields a surface gravity that is more consistent with the KIC value. Additional observations are required to resolve the stellar properties. This target is discussed in more depth by Fabrycky et al. (2012). We note that Figure 1 of Latham et al. (2011) contains other short-period giant planet candidates: the candidates associated with KOI-961. This high proper M dwarf from the proper motion catalog of Lepine &amp; Shara (2005) (LSPM J1928 + 4437) is unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog. In B11, the stellar radius was estimated by inferring an effective temperature from the J-K color and assuming a Main Sequence luminosity class. Improved stellar properties and light curve modeling of Muirhead et al. (2012) result in a considerable decrease in the star and planet radii thereby removing these candidates from the upper left corner of Figure 8 and strengthening the case for an observed paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems. Application of the statistical arguments presented by Lissauer et al. (2012) to the current population of multis implies that there are over 880 (98% of 898) bona fide planets in this sample alone. A comprehensive study of the architecture of these multis is presented by Fabrycky et al. (2012). 7.3. Candidates in the Habitable Zone Borucki et al. (2011b) identified 54 transiting planet candidates in the Habitable Zone (HZ), defined by an equilibrium temperature, T eq (see Section 5.3), between the freezing and boiling point of water (273 to 373 K). As pointed out by Kasting (2011a), this definition fails to take into consideration the warming effect of an atmosphere, thereby rendering many of the candidates too hot for habitability even under the most liberal assumptions about their climatic conditions. As the roster of small planets at long orbital periods grows, so has the attention paid to the issue of habitability. Recent modeling efforts suggest that the equilibrium temperature at the inner edge of the HZ might be closer to 270 K (Selsis et al. 2007), corresponding to rapid water loss via H escape or a runaway greenhouse effect, depending on the surface water content. The outer edge depends on the fractional cloud coverage and ranges from 175 K to 200 K (Kaltenegger &amp; Sasselov 2011). Others have proposed defining the HZ in terms of insolation (the amount of stellar flux incident on the planet surface) in order to remove the built-in assumptions (e.g. Bond albedo) required to compute the equilibrium temperature (Domagal-Goldman 2012). The star and planet properties provided in Tables 3, 4, and 5 can be used to compute the insolation and/or equilibrium temperature under different assumptions for the purpose of assessing questions of habitability on a case-by-case basis. Here, we use equilibrium temperature as defined in Section 5.3 to examine the population of planet candidates likely to be in or near the Habitable Zone. Figure 9 shows planet radius versus equilibrium temperature for the entire sample of planet candidates. For reference, we include a vertical dashed line (middle) to mark the equilibrium temperature of the Earth computed under the same set of assumptions. With each new catalog (blue to red to yellow points), we see a clear trend toward Earth-size planets at Earth's equilibrium temperature (i.e. toward the bottom left hand corner of the diagram).</figDesc></figure>

The site serves up plots of Kepler light curves broken into 30-day segments, and, through a sequence of queries, leads the user through a high level classification that sorts light curves by their qualitative properties, or appearance. Discerning eyes flag events that resemble transits, and the goal is to have every light curve examined by at least 5 independent users. Since its launch in December 2010, over 10 million classifications have been made by over 100,000 users, underscoring the remarkable enthusiasm of the general public. The site affords one not only the opportunity to experience the scientific method but also the possibility of experiencing the gratification of discovery. With its power in numbers, the citizen science project is a welcome complement to the automated detection algorithms in Kepler's software pipeline. The Planet Hunters science team combines the results from the multiple classifications for each 30-day light curve segment to identify potential planet candidates within the publicly released Kepler data. Transit-like events flagged by the public are assessed by the Planet Hunters science team. The Kepler project office then assists in vetting further for false prositives. This process resulted in the identification of four potential planet candidates in the Q1 public data (Fischer et al. 2011), associated with stars KIC 10905746, KIC 8242434, KIC 6185331, and KIC 11820830, two of which (KIC 10905746 and KIC 6185331) were deemed viable candidates after inspection of vetting metrics. These four candidates were assigned KOI numbers (1725.01, 1726.01, 1727.01, and 1728.01, respectively), and blindly re-assessed together with the candidates identified here using Q1-Q6 data and the associated vetting metrics. All but 1728.01 survived as viable planet candidates. Their properties are listed in Tables 4 and 5. KOI-1728.01 was rejected due to the large radius of the companion (&gt; 5 R J ) and hints of ellipsoidal variations in the light curve indicative of a higher mass (i.e. stellar) companion. This target has been included in the Eclipsing Binary catalog (Pr˘ sa et al. 2011; Slawson et al. 2011). More recently, inspection of the Q1-Q2 pubic data by Planet Hunters led to another set of viable planet candidates associated with the stars KIC 4552729 and KIC 10005758 (Lintott et al. 2012). KIC 10005758 had already been assigned a KOI number due to the identification of a different transit event at a shorter period (KOI-1783.01). The new, longer period candidate identified by the Planet Hunters team has been assigned the KOI number 1783.02 while the candidate associated with KIC 4552729 has been assigned KOI number 2691.01. Detection statistics on KOI-1783.02 and KOI-2691.01 are not identified by the Q1-Q6 pipeline run due to a) the long orbital period (KOI-1783.02) and b) systematic noise sources that precluded identification of the correct orbital period (2691.01). The events are readily identified in a Q1-Q8 pipeline run that more recently became available, and all vetting statistics indicate that both are strong candidates.

However, subsequent spectroscopic follow-up observations indicate that the host star is more likely to be a giant. Preliminary estimates of the planet radius are larger than 3R J . The KIC also lists an erroneous apparent magnitude in the Kepler bandpass for this star. The erroneous magnitude leads to a non-optimal photometric aperture precluding reliable photo-center analysis. This will be important since there is a brighter star (KIC 9880470) less than 5 away. More detailed analysis of KOI-364.01 and KOI-1026.01 suggests that the transit detection statistics are driven by systematics in the data.

With multi-quarter functionality, data from different quarters are stitched together within pipeline modules before whitening and combing for transits.
