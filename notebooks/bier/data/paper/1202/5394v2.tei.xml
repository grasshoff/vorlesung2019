				<p>We estimate the stellar parameters of late K and early M type Kepler target stars. We obtain medium resolution visible spectra of 382 stars with K P − J &gt; 2 (≃ K5 and later spectral type). We determine luminosity class by comparing the strength of gravity-sensitive indices (CaH, K I, Ca II, and Na I) to their strength in a sample of stars of known luminosity class. We find that giants constitute 96 ± 1% of the bright (K P &lt; 14) Kepler target stars, and 7 ± 3% of dim (K P &gt; 14) stars, significantly higher than fractions based on the stellar parameters quoted in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC effective temperatures are systematically (110 +15 −35 K) higher than temperatures we determine from fitting our spectra to PHOENIX stellar models. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the Kepler exoplanet candidate population, we find a planet occurrence of 0.36 ± 0.08 when giant stars are properly removed, somewhat higher than when a KIC log g &gt; 4 criterion is used (0.27 ± 0.05). Lastly, we show that there is no significant difference in g − r color (a probe of metallicity) between late-type Kepler stars with transiting Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanet candidates and dwarf stars with no detected transits. We show that a previous claimed offset between these two populations is most likely an artifact of including a large number of misidentified giants.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The NASA Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) has ushered exoplanet science into a new phase of analysis based on the statistics of large samples. Among the more elementary statistics derived from Kepler results are the planet occurrence around stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howard et al. 2011</ref>, henceforth H11), the distribution of planet size (or mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolfgang &amp; Laughlin 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gaidos et al. 2012)</ref>, correlations between the presence of planets and the properties of the host stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Schlaufman &amp; Laughlin 2011, henceforth SL11)</ref>, and the characteristics of multiplanet systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>). These findings yield important constraints on models of planet formation and evolution, and are best established for solar-type stars (late F through early K spectral types) because they constitute the vast majority of Kepler targets.</p><p>The results of Kepler were first preceded by the findings of radial velocity surveys of solar-type stars. More than 15% of dwarf stars have close-in (∼0.25 AU) planets with orbital periods less than 50 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howard et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howard et al. , 2011</ref> and this fraction increases with orbital period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). The same authors find that planet occurrence is inversely related to planet mass or radius, with "super-Earths" outnumbering Jupiter-size planets by more than an order of magnitude. Around solar-type stars, the presence of giant planets is strongly correlated with super-solar metallicity (Gonzalez 1997; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Santos et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johnson et al. 2010</ref>), but this correlation does not appear to hold for smaller planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sousa et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bouchy et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayor et al. 2011</ref>). As with results from Kepler, these findings are primarily for solar-type stars because many nearby representatives are bright enough for ground-based Doppler radial velocity observations. Very cool (late K and early M type) dwarf stars have become popular targets of planet searches (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Charbonneau et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vogt et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bean et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mann et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Apps et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fischer et al. 2012</ref>). Planets around cool stars are easier to detect because of the stars' smaller masses and radii. Furthermore, because these stars are less luminous, close-in and thus detectable planets can still orbit within the "habitable zone," where an Earth-like planet would avoid the "snowball" or runaway greenhouse climate states ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gaidos et al. 2007</ref>). However, the statistics of planets around these stars are poorly established. These stars are underrepresented in magnitude-limited Doppler surveys as well as the Kepler target list. Only 2% of Kepler target stars are classified as possible M types (cooler than 4000 K), whereas &gt;70% of all stars within 20 pc are M dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Henry et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chabrier 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Reid et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, Kepler data has been used to draw two important conclusions about late-type exoplanet hosts. First, H11 found that the frequency of stars with planets on close-in (P&lt; 50d) orbits rises with decreasing effective temperature through early K-type and that an even higher fraction of M dwarf stars may host such planets. Second, SL11 claimed that late K dwarf stars, but not solar-type stars, hosting super-Earth to Neptune sized candidate transiting planets are more metal rich than stars for which transits have not been detected. These findings offer potential tests of theories of planet formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kennedy &amp; Kenyon 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cumming et al. 2008)</ref> Kepler targets are selected from the Kepler input catalog (KIC) based on the ability of the mission to find transiting planets, especially in the habitable zone; ideally, the target catalog should consist exclusively of dwarf stars for which the signal of a transiting planet is largest, and exclude sub-giant and giant stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2011)</ref> used D51 (Mg Ib line) photometry and Sloan g-D51 color to exclude giants, however this is also sensitive to temperature and metallicity and is not available for all targets. The KIC includes Sloan (griz) and 2MASS (JHK) magnitudes; stellar parameters are estimated by forward modeling of the photometric data with the synthetic spectra of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2004)</ref>, and effective temperature T ef f , gravity log g, and metallicity [M/H] as free parameters. Stellar mass and distance are then estimated using luminosity, T ef f , and log g from the stellar evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Girardi et al. (2000)</ref>. The combination of stellar mass and log g then yields a stellar radius. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2011)</ref> state that KIC radius estimates have average errors of 35% and are not reliable for stars cooler than 4000 K. H11 point out that, because of the difficulty in constraining log g, the radii of some stars, particularly sub-giants, may be underestimated by a factor of 2 or more in the KIC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gaidos et al. (2012)</ref> found that consistency between the Kepler candidate planet catalog and the M2K Doppler survey could be achieved if the former was incomplete compared to estimates based on KIC radii. They further point out that Kepler planet candidates were conspicuously sparse among late K stars with colors that are shared by both dwarfs and giant stars. Finally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Muirhead et al. (2012)</ref> (henceforth M11) showe that KIC estimates for the radii of many Kepler M dwarfs hosting planets are smaller than KIC values by as much as a factor of two. This discrepancy is not to be confused with the 5-10% radius difference between radii of the most refined models and measurements by interferometry and observations of eclipsing binaries (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">López-Santiago et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kraus et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Reliable stellar parameters are a prerequisite for robust statistical analysis of planets, especially transiting planets. These are needed not only for stars for which planet candidates have been detected (referred to as Kepler Objects of Interest or KOIs), but also for the target sample as a whole. The radius of a planet producing a given transit depth is proportional to the radius of its host star. Likewise, the transit signal produced by a planet of a given radius -and hence its detectability around a star in the survey -also depends on stellar radius. If some target stars are actually larger or even giant stars, then planets are less likely to be detected in that sample, which means that the most likely occurrence rate of those planets is higher. For M dwarf stars in general, and particularly for the coolest Kepler target stars, parameters such as radius are uncertain or even very unreliable (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al. 2012, M11)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2011)</ref> metallicities are reliable to 0.4 dex for solar-type stars, but are essentially useless for stars with T ef f &lt; 4000. Instead, SL11 use Sloan g − r colors for a given J − H range (a proxy for spectral type) as an indicator of the amount of Fe line blanketing at blue wavelengths, and hence metallicity. They construct mean g − r vs. J − H loci for KOIs and Kepler stars without identified transits. They find a significant difference between the g − r colors of the two populations for stars with J − H ≈ 0.62, corresponding to late Ktype stars. Based on stellar models, SL11 argue that the late-type KOIs are ≃ 0.2 dex more metal rich than Kepler targets with no detected transit. However, K giants are significantly bluer than dwarfs in g − r, for the same J − H ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yanny et al. 2009</ref>). Thus, contamination of the Kepler target sample by giants would shift the locus of target stars to bluer g − r, but would not affect the KOI locus, as planets are less detectable, or completely undetectable around giant stars. Realizing this, SL11 constructed and analyzed artificial mixed data sets to estimate that a 10-30% contamination by giants would also produce the observed offset.</p><p>M11 use the equivalent widths of atomic lines in the K (2. Moderate resolution spectra are nearly always sufficient to distinguish K and M giants from their dwarf cousins. In addition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ciardi et al. (2011)</ref> showed that some giant stars can be identified based on JHK photometry alone. In this paper, we combine moderate resolution spectra of a sample of Kepler targets with KIC photometry to refine the planet occurrence rate for latetype stars calculated by H11, and determine if the giant fraction is high enough to explain the color offset observed by SL11. In Section 2 we present spectroscopy of a representative sample of late-type Kepler target stars. In Section 3 we use both spectroscopy and photometry to derive luminosity classes and calculate the giant fraction for late-type Kepler target stars. In Section 4 we use this information, plus radii based on stellar evolutionary models, to refine the planet occurrence around these stars. In Section 5 we calculate and compare the mean g − r colors (as metallicity proxies) of KOIs and a bona fide dwarf sample, and show how and why our results differ from those of SL11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SAMPLE, OBSERVATIONS, AND REDUCTION</head><p>Because derived KIC parameters may not always be reliable, we instead select our sample using photometry. A sample of stars with V − J &gt; 2.5 will include &gt; 98% of all M dwarfs, as well as most of the K7 dwarfs in the sample <ref type="bibr">(Lépine &amp; Gaidos 2011, henceforth LG11)</ref>. Although 2MASS J magnitudes are available for almost the entire sample, V magnitudes are not. Kepler magnitudes (K P ), however, are available for all target stars. For M0 stars, K P − V ≃ −0.43 4 so we conservatively select stars with Kp − J &gt; 2 observed in Quarters 0-2 by Kepler and retrieved from the Multimission Archive (STScI). We remove stars with a contaminating star within 1 arc second. Bright Kepler target stars were selected in a fundamentally different way from dim stars (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. 2010</ref>). We separately analyzed dim (K P &gt; 14) and bright (K P &lt; 14) stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bessell &amp; Brett (1988)</ref> showed that giant stars tend to have more extreme J − H colors than their dwarf counterparts. However, we wanted to investigate how misidentified giant stars in the KIC are distributed with J − H color. Thus we further subdivided our sample into four J − H color bins: J − H ≤ 0.70, 0.70 &lt; J − H ≤ 0.76, 0.76 &lt; J − H ≤ 0.82, and 0.82 &lt; J − H for the bright stars and J − H ≤ 0.62, 0.62 &lt; J − H ≤ 0.65, 0.65 &lt; J − H ≤ 0.68, and J − H &gt; 0.68 for the dim stars. Color bins were designed such that each contains a similar number of stars. We observed a sample of stars within each bin, selected randomly with respect to J − H. We observed more bright stars because they are more observationally accessible, although we observed targets spanning all Kepler magnitudes to detect trends with K P . In total we observed 382 stars covering 6.5 &lt; K P &lt; 16, 0.40 &lt; J − H &lt; 1.00 and KIC effective temperatures 3200 &lt; T ef f &lt; 5050 K. The distribution of observed targets is shown in J − H and KIC T ef f space in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. A list of observed targets is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Observations were obtained between June 16 and Aug 28 (2011) with the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lantz et al. 2004</ref>) at the University of Hawaii 2.2m telescope on Mauna Kea and the Boller and Chivens CCD Spectrograph (CCDS) or the Mark III spectrograph (MkIII) at the MDM Observatory 1.3m McGraw-Hill telescope on Kitt Peak. SNIFS is an optical integral field spectrograph with R ≃ 1300 that splits the signal with a dichroic mirror into blue (3000 − 5200Å5200Å) and red (5000 − 9500Å9500Å) channels. SNIFS images were resampled with microlens arrays, dispersed with grisms, and focused onto blue-and red-sensitive CCDs. Processing of SNIFS data was performed with the SNIFS pipeline, described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aldering et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Pereira et al. (2010)</ref>. SNIFS processing included dark, bias, and flat-field corrections, assembling the data into red and blue 3D data cubes, and cleaning them for cosmic rays and bad pixels. After sky subtraction, the spectra are extracted with a PSF model, and wavelengths were calibrated with arc lamp exposures taken at the same telescope pointing as the science data.</p><p>The CCDS and MkIII spectrographs cover 5700 − 9300Å9300Å and 4400 − 8300Å8300Å with R ≃ 1150 and ≃ 2300, respectively. Standard reduction of data taken with the CCDS and MkIII was performed with IRAF, following the practice of overscan subtraction, division by flat field, and extraction of the spectra. Spectra were wavelengthcalibrated against NeArXe comparison arcs. All observations (including SNIFS) were flux-calibrated and telluric lines were removed based on observations of the NOAO primary spectrophotometric standards Feige 66, Feige 110, and BD+284211. All spectra had a median S/N of &gt; 30 in the 6000-7000Å7000Å range, and the median S/N of all spectra in this range was 50.</p><p>Our spectroscopic set only covers K P − J &gt; 2.0, but we also consider a separate 'photometric sample' that includes stars with 0.56 &lt; J−H &lt; 0.66</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K P −J &gt; 2</formula><p>. This is done so we can ensure coverage of the sample of late K stars used by SL11 (see Section 5). The KIC includes JHK photometry from 2MASS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) and visible-wavelength photometry through SDSS griz and D51 filters. We add photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wright et al. 2010</ref>), which includes 3.4µm, 4.6µm, 12µm, and 22µm bands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LUMINOSITY CLASS</head><p>We determine luminosity class by comparing the spectral indices or colors of Kepler target stars to those of stars drawn from 'training sets' of known giants or dwarfs. We first discuss how we construct our training sets. We then explain our choice of indices and colorcolor relations, based on previous work on giant/dwarf discrimination and derived empirically from examination of the differences between the dwarf and giant training set. We use the colors and spectroscopic indices of stars in the training sets to construct a likelihood estimator, such that we can calculate the likelihood that a given star is a giant (or dwarf). That calculation is explained in Section 3.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Training Sets</head><p>We construct an uncontaminated set of dwarf stars from a sample of high proper motion-selected late dK and dM stars (LG11). The brightest (J &lt; 9) northern stars in the LG11 catalog have visible-wavelength spectra <ref type="bibr">(Lépine et al. in prep)</ref>, obtained with the same instruments and reduced in the same way as was done for Kepler targets observed for this paper. Although the sample from <ref type="bibr">Lépine et al. (in prep</ref>) includes more than 1500 spectra, we construct our dwarf sample only from the 620 targets with spectra from SNIFS/UH2.2m, which includes the Ca II triplet feature at 8484 − 8662Å8662Å.</p><p>LG11 use J − H, and H − K colors, combined with proper motion from SUPERBLINK <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lépine &amp; Shara 2005)</ref> and (for some targets) parallax information from Hipparcos (van <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Leeuwen &amp; Fantino 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">van Leeuwen 2007)</ref> to remove giant stars. Based on those stars in LG11 with parallaxes, we estimate that fewer than 0.5% of the resulting sample will be giants. However, because of strict cuts in J − H and H − K, the LG11 sample is incomplete and biased against dwarfs with much redder or bluer colors. LG11 also use a color cut of V − J &gt; 2.7 to select mostly M dwarfs. This excludes some mid-to late-K stars which will be included in our (K P − J &gt; 2 0.58 &lt; J − H &lt; 0.66) color cut for the photometric sample (see Section 2). We therefore add 60 late K and early M dwarfs included in the Hipparcos catalog that have UH2.2m spectra but lie outside the cuts imposed by LG11. These stars are confirmed to be dwarfs by their Hipparcos parallaxes. We also add 150 M dwarfs with spectra from SDSS, including 50 dwarf from West et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2011)</ref>, with r − J and J − H colors consistent with our targets of interest. We verify that these targets are dwarfs using a cut with reduced proper motion, where the reduced proper motion in the SDSS g band is:</p><p>H g = g + 5 log µ + 5,</p><p>and µ is the proper motion in arcsec yr −1 . This quantity is similar to the absolute magnitude, such that giant stars will have much lower reduced proper motions than dwarfs of the same color. We only select SDSS stars with H g &gt; 2.2(g − r) + 7.0, and µ &gt; 15 arcsec yr −1 , which we determine empirically from our UH2.2m targets with SDSS photometry. Our sample of &gt;300 giant spectra is constructed from multiple catalogs, specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fluks et al. (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Danks &amp; Dennefeld (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen &amp; Strom (1995)</ref>, Serote <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roos et al. (1996)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Montes et al. (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">and Lançon &amp; Wood (2000)</ref>, as well as 80 bright stars we observed with UH2.2/SNIFS that are confirmed to be giants by Hipparcos. Many spectra have significantly higher resolution than our own observations. We convolve these data with a gaussian to match the resolution of our own sample to remove any resolution-dependency in our results. To include sufficient SDSS photometry, we supplement our giant training set by including 200 giant stars with spectra from SDSS all with r &lt; 16 and proper motions consistent with zero. We require these SDSS spectra to have spectroscopic indices consistent with the rest of the giant training set. Because we select only SDSS stars with indices consistent with indices from spectra from the rest of the training stars, SDSS giant stars have no effect on our spectroscopic determination of luminosity class. Rather, these SDSS stars are added only for their photometry.</p><p>SDSS, 2MASS and WISE colors are available for much . Approximate regions for each of the six indices we use for giant/dwarf discrimination, as well as the TiO5 band, are marked in grey. B 1 refers to a mix of atomic lines (Ba II, Fe I, Mn I, and Ti I) which overlap at the resolution of SNIFS (≃ 1300). The TiO5 molecular band is used as a probe of spectral type, although it is also sensitive to metallicity <ref type="bibr">(Lépine et al. 2007</ref>). Other atomic and molecular lines are generally much weaker in late type giant stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Reid &amp; Hawley 2005)</ref>. Indeed, the Na I (8172-8197Å8197Å) and K I (7669-7705Å7705Å) doublets are significantly weaker in the giant spectrum while they are both quite strong in the dwarf.</p><p>of our giant and dwarf training set; however, most lack D51 photometry, which covers the gravity-sensitive Mg Ib line at 5200Å5200Å. Instead, we synthesize equivalent g − D51 colors from the spectra of our training set. We obtain the zero point for the synthesized colors of those stars in our sample which have both spectra and g and D51 magnitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Spectroscopic Determination of Luminosity Class</head><p>Our determination of luminosity class uses six different gravity-sensitive molecular or atomic indices <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table  2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). Molecular and atomic indices are ratios of the average flux levels in a specified wavelength region to that of a pseudo-continuum region. Indices are useful for M dwarfs where the continuum is poorly defined. The values of most indices are a function of both gravity and temperature of the star. To remove this degeneracy we compare measured indices to the TiO5 spectral index. TiO5, as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Reid et al. (1995)</ref>, is sensitive to spectral type and metallicity <ref type="bibr">(Woolf &amp; Wallerstein 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lépine et al. 2007</ref>) but it has minimal gravity dependance (Jao et al. 2008) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>We show spectra of giant and dwarf stars with similar effective temperatures in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, with the location of each feature labeled. As can be seen, most atomic lines are weaker in giants than in dwarfs. Indeed the Na I doublet (8172-8197Å8197Å) and K I (7669-7705Å7705Å) lines are quite shallow in giants while relatively deep in dwarfs (Torres-Dodgen &amp; Weaver 1993; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schiavon et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Reid &amp; Hawley 2005</ref>). Molecular lines provide additional luminosity-dependent spectral signatures. Metal hydride bands, such as the CaH bands defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Reid et al.

(2011)</ref> primarily use g − D51 vs. g − r and J − K vs. g − i colors to separate Kepler late-type giants from dwarfs. Both giants and the coolest dwarfs in the sample have relatively weak Mg Ib lines, creating overlap between the dwarf and giant training sets at red g − r. A similar effect happens with J − K. Near-infrared photometry (JHK) has long been used to separate giants and dwarfs at redder colors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bessell &amp; Brett 1988)</ref>, in part due to strong CO and weak Na I and Ca I absorption in giant stars. But for K and early M stars with J − H &lt; 0.7 and H − K &lt; 0.2, the giant and dwarf sequences overlap, creating a sizable region of ambiguity. At mid-infrared wavelengths, most giant stars have warm dust emission, leading to significantly redder colors in the WISE bandpasses. Other relations can be derived from an examination of our giant and dwarf training sets. z − K vs. g − J follows a similar distribution to that of J − K vs. g − i, but the giant and dwarf samples bifurcate at g − J ≃ 3.0, which makes this color useful for isolating the reddest giants.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Application of training sets to the Kepler sample</head><p>After each spectral index or color is measured or calculated for Kepler targets and both training sets, we identify stars as giants or dwarfs following the same technique as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gilbert et al. (2006)</ref>. We begin by using the spectral index or color measurements of the training stars to produce a two-dimensional probability distribution function (PDF) for each index (or color). The PDFs are constructed by treating the strength of each index or color (henceforth S) as a Gaussian distributed variable with respect to X. For spectroscopic determination of luminosity class, X is a parameter that primarily relates to the spectral type (although it may have some gravity dependence), while S is a parameter that primarily relates to log g. For the spectroscopic determination of luminosity class, X is the TiO5 band and S is one of our six gravity-sensitive indices (Na I, Ca II, Ba II/Fe I/Mn I/Ti I, K I, or CaH). For photometric determination of luminosity class, X is defined as g − J, g − i, J − H, g − r, 3.4µm -22µm, or J − 3.4µm and S is z − K, J − K, H − K, g − D51, 4.6µm -12µm, or K − 4.6µm, respectively. Values of S are binned according to their corresponding X value. Bins in X are designed to contain an equal number of stars (20-25) in each bin, and because of this are not equally spaced in X. The mean (S) and standard deviation (σ S ) of the distribution is computed in each bin. The two-dimensional PDF takes the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P DF (X, S) = Cexp −(S − S(X)) 2 2(σ S (X)) 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where C is a normalization such that the entire PDF integrates to 1.

Weights are calculated by determining the efficiency of a given feature at separating giants from dwarfs as a function of X. We take a random subsample (half the total sample) from each training set, and add Poisson noise to the spectra/colors consistent with our observations or given photometric errors. We then apply Equations 2 -4 to the subsamples using w j (X) = 1 for all X, j. Values of w j are then set based on the fraction of dwarfs/giants correctly identified within a training set. w j (X) = 1 if the feature/color identifies 100% of the targets within a given X bin correctly and w j (x) = 0 if the feature/color identifies 50% or less (i.e. no better than guessing) of the targets correctly. Weights are linearly interpolated (based on the fraction of stars correctly identified) between these two values. Repeating the calculation of L i using w j = 1 for all j does not change the classification of any stars with spectra (i.e. our results from spectra are essentially independent of our choice of weighting scheme). However, this is not the case for luminosity classes determined from color-color relations. The reason for this is the significant overlap between the PDFs of the color metrics for giant and dwarf training sets (e.g. 2.3 &lt; g − J &lt; 2.8 and 1.6 &lt; z − K &lt; 1.9, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). In overlapping regions, indices or colors will give similar probabilities for a star being a giant or a dwarf, making the metric less useful in giant/dwarf discrimination. This problem is solved by our weighting scheme, as regions where giant and dwarf training sets overlap tend to have lower weights. We show a plot of the weights for the color-color relations in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Weighting factors are set to 0 if any of the relevant indices/colors for a given star are missing or lie outside the range of our training sets.</p><p>We identify all Kepler target stars with spectra as a giant or a dwarf with better than 99% (L i &gt; 2.0 or</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L i &lt; −2.0) confidence.</formula><p>The full list of determined luminosity classes for stars with spectra is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table  1</ref>.

However, ≃ 3% of the sample are more ambiguous, most of which lack photometry in several bands.</p><p>Since giant/dwarf assignments based on spectroscopy are very accurate, only binomial errors are considered for the spectroscopic sample. For uncertainty estimates from the photometric sample, we re-apply our likelihood calculations using 1000 different subsets of our training sets, adding random (Poisson) noise to the photometry, and then recalculating the giant fraction in each case. The variation in giant fraction is added in quadrature with binomial errors. This does not consider systematic errors (e.g. systematic photometric errors, discrepancies between training sets and Kepler target stars, etc).</p></div>

The fraction of giants is 96 ± 1% for bright stars, 7 ± 3% for dim stars, and 52 ± 3% for the combined set (based on our spectroscopy). Photometric assignments (considering K P − J &gt; 2) give consistent giant fractions: 97 ± 2% for bright stars, 11 ± 3% for dim stars, and 55 ± 3% for all stars with K P − J &gt; 2. The fractions in each brightness bin decrease somewhat when we apply a KIC log g &gt; 4.0 cut. The giant fraction becomes 74 ± 8% for bright stars and 3 ± 2% for dim stars. The fraction of giants for all stars significantly decreases to 10 ± 2%, due mainly to the large number of stars lacking any log g classification, most of which are giants and all of which are removed by this cut.</p></div>

This also applies to stars with detected planet candidates, causing the planet to be removed, i.e. we consider the planet detection to be a false positive if the star is a giant.

Our photometric selection may remove some metal-poor dwarfs. However, even when we include stars ≥ 60% likelihood of being dwarfs, which will necessarily increase the number of interloping giants, the offset is still only 0.03 ± 0.02 (consistent with zero offset).</p><p>In spite of the low giant fraction for dim Kepler target stars, it is not sufficient to simply repeat the SL11 analysis exclusively for stars with K P &gt; 14. Since SL11 only 0 (solid line, asterisks), &gt; 90% likelihood of being dwarfs based on their colors (dotted line, triangles), &gt; 90% likelihood of being giants (dashed line, circles). The 1σ errors are calculated for the median in each bin by bootstrap resampling. Bins for all data sets are the same, but each point is offset slightly from the bin center for clarity. There is a statistically significant offset between the KIC log g &gt; 4.0 sample and the planet hosts when we consider stars with 0.58 &lt; J − H &lt; 0.66, however, this offset is no longer present when misidentified giant stars are removed from the sample. Indeed, our dwarf control sample closely tracks the colors of the planet-hosting stellar population.</p><p>examine stars with KIC log g &gt; 4.0, it is far more important to investigate the g − r distribution of misidentified giants in the 0.56 &lt; J − H &lt; 0.66 color range (i.e. giant stars that were assigned log g &gt; 4 in the KIC). In fact the fraction of misidentified dim giant stars in their J − H ≃ 0.62 bin is higher (12%), than it is for the K P − J &gt; 2 star sample. We show why this is the case in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>, which shows the distribution of giants, dwarfs, and misidentified giants in J − H vs. g − r space. Misidentified giants are more concentrated at 0.58 &lt; J − H &lt; 0.63. Further, the misidentified giants in this J − H range are much more blue than the dwarfs in the same range. Thus by selecting a color bin centered on J −H = 0.62, SL11 are over-selecting giant stars, even after applying a KIC log g &gt; 4 cut (≃ 15% of this sample are giant stars). This concentration of misidentified giants is the most likely explanation for the color offset seen by SL11, and also explains why the same g − r offset is not seen at redder J − H colors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We use visible-wavelength spectra to determine the properties of a subset of late-type Kepler target stars. We separate giants from dwarfs by comparing our spectra to those of stars with known luminosity class, and determine effective temperatures by comparing with PHOENIX model spectra. We extend our results to a larger collection of Kepler stars using photometry from the KIC, 2MASS, and WISE catalogs. We apply our luminosity class determinations to refine estimates of the planet occurrence around stars with 3400 &lt; T ef f &lt; 4100, and compare the colors -and hence metallicities of stars with and without detected Earth and Neptune sized planets. We draw four major conclusions:</p><p>1. Among stars redder than K P − J = 2 (≃ K5 and later), bright (K P &lt; 14) stars are predominantly (96 ± 1%) giants, while dim stars (K P &gt; 14) are predominantly (93 ± 3%) dwarfs. These fractions improve somewhat when we consider stars with KIC determined log g &gt; 4.0 (74 ± 8% and 97 ± 2% respectively). Overall, 52 ± 3% of Kepler stars with K P − J &gt; 2 are giants. However, only 10 ± 2% of said stars with KIC log g &gt; 4.0 are giants, a consequence of the large number of late-type stars lacking any temperature or log g values in the KIC.</p><p>2. KIC effective temperatures, based on the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2004)</ref> and griz and JHK photometry, are systematically higher by 110 +15 −35 K compared to those derived from our own spectra and PHOENIX BT-SETTL atmosphere models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allard et al. 2010</ref>).</p><p>3. Adopting the temperature scale from BT-SETTL and radii/masses from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dotter et al. 2008</ref>) and removing stars we identify as giants based on nonparametric and parametric Monte Carlo calculations we find a planet occurrence rate of ≃ 0.36 ± 0.08 for planets with radii 2R ⊕ &lt; R P &lt; 32R ⊕ and periods 1 &lt; P &lt; 50 days per star in the temperature range 3400 &lt; T ef f &lt; 4100. Using the KIC determined luminosity classes leads to a somewhat lower planet occurrence of 0.26 ± 0.05.</p><p>4. The g − r colors of exoplanet host stars at J − H ≃ 0.62 are consistent with an unbiased sample of Kepler dwarf stars, ruling out any large difference between hosts of Earth-to-Neptune sized planets and those without any detected planets.</p><p>Surprisingly, there are hundreds of stars in our photometric sample that could have been easily identified as giants with KIC photometry, but were assigned log g &gt; 4.</p><p>The KIC primarily uses g −D51 vs g −r colors to identify giants, and many late-type stars with KIC log g &gt; 4.0 have g − D51 vs g − r colors consistent with giants (and inconsistent with dwarfs).</p><p>Our calculated giant fraction is consistent with other independent measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gaidos et al. (2012)</ref> compare radial velocity data from M2K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Apps et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fischer et al. 2012</ref>) to Kepler results and note that the completeness of the coolest Kepler target stars may be quite low (≃ 50%), much of which could be explained by an underestimate of the frequency of giant stars. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ciardi et al. (2011)</ref> find that bright Kepler M stars are"predominantly giants, regardless of the KIC classification" based on JHK photometry alone. Our giant fraction is also consistent with the current understanding of Galactic structure: based on a simulation from TRILEGAL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Girardi et al. 2005</ref>), ≃ 92 of stars near the center of the Kepler field with K P &lt; 14 and K P − J &gt; 2.0 are giants.</p><p>Interestingly, we find two KOIs with colors consistent with giant stars. KOI 667 and KOI 977 both fall within our giant training set in multiple color relations, and outside our dwarf training set. M11 identify KOI 977 as a giant, and they also note that KOI 667 consisted of 5 objects within 6 ′′ which may be contaminating 2MASS or WISE photometry. One of these objects could be an eclipsing binary, diluted by the other stars. KOI 667 also has a relatively high (10%) false positive probability based on Galactic structure models <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Morton &amp; Johnson 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our values of T ef f are consistent with results reported elsewhere also using BT-SETTL, including observations of the late-type KOIs with near-infrared spec- </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>tra M11. These authors find a similar systematic offset of 123 +24</head><p>−32 K between their temperatures and KIC assigned temperatures. KIC temperatures are based on the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2004)</ref> and the evolutionary tracks of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Girardi et al. (2000)</ref>, which, although reliable for solar-mass stars, are untrustworthy for stars with T ef f &lt; 3750 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Our planet occurrence estimate is slightly higher than that of H11, who, using results from Kepler, find a planet occurrence rate of 0.30 ± 0.08 for stars with 3600 &lt; T ef f &lt; 4100. The difference is primarily due to reliance on luminosity class determinations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>, which we find to be inaccurate. However, the difference is within 1σ. For both our work and that of H11, errors are dominated by the low number of late-type stars (and therefore planets around them) in the Kepler field and very high random (∼ 35%) errors in stellar radii.</p><p>In addition to random errors (e.g. stellar radii and R p /R * ) that are included in our Monte Carlo simulation, there may be large systematic uncertainties in atmosphere models and evolutionary tracks, which can change the resulting frequency. When we use the Yonsei-Yale isochrones, it decreases our planet occurrence by ≃ 0.08. Interestingly, this difference is similar in size to the random errors in our Monte Carlo analysis (≃ 0.08), and the difference between proper giant removal and using KIC log g &gt; 4.0 (≃ 0.10). This suggests that giant star removal, improved stellar characterization of the dwarf stars, and use of reliable stellar models of late-type stars are of roughly equal importance in characterizing the planet occurrence around very cool stars.</p><p>The lack of a strong correlation between host-star metallicity and the presence of Earth-to-Neptune sized planets is consistent with what is found for solar-type stars, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref>. This also matches the findings of M11, who determine that among the late-type Kepler exoplanet hosts in our sample the median [M/H] is −0.11 ± 0.02. This distribution is consistent with stars in the solar neighborhood <ref type="bibr">(−0.05 to −0.15, Johnson &amp; Apps 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Schlaufman &amp; Laughlin 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Casagrande et al. 2011</ref>). A metallicity difference could only be present if Kepler target stars are signifi-cantly more metal poor than stars in the solar neighborhood. As explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gaidos et al. (2012)</ref>, Kepler late K and M stars are &lt; 250 pc from the Sun, and 60 pc above the galactic plane. Most of the stars will be in the thin disk, and have metallicities similar to that of the solar neighborhood.</p><p>Our analysis of the g − r colors of planet hosts contradicts the results of SL11, who find a 4σ difference between g − r colors of late-type exoplanet hosts and stars with no exoplanets present. Their result is most likely an artifact of the large number of stars which were misclassified as dwarfs in the KIC. SL11 state that their result can be reproduced if their sample of KIC log g &gt; 4 stars is between 10% and 30% giants, which they calculate by adding stars with KIC log g &lt; 4 stars (test giant stars) into their control sample, and measuring the resulting g − r color offset. We find that the giant fraction is above 10% for this color range. Further, if the KIC log g &gt; 4 sample that SL11 used was significantly contaminated with giants, the sample will have bluer colors than a true dwarf sample. Adding test giants (to measure the resulting color change) to an already giant-star contaminated sample will create smaller changes in the overall color of a sample than if the sample had contained only dwarf stars. Thus more test giant stars will be required to produce a given color offset, creating an artificially high estimate for the level of giant contamination required to produce the observed color difference.</p><p>Although the g − r colors of exoplanet hosts in our sample are consistent with our dwarf sample, we cannot rule out small offsets ( 0.05) in g − r color. It is possible that any metallicity effect is sufficiently small that it is diluted to non-detection by the large number of undetected exoplanets in the dwarf sample. As Kepler continues to discover planets of smaller radii and at larger orbital periods, the answer may become more clear.

Our observing bins (see Section 2) are marked by blue lines. There is a clear difference between the colors of bright (K P &lt; 14) and dim (K P &gt; 14) Kepler target stars, resulting in a very different distribution of colors. The great majority of KOIs are faint, and have bluer J − H colors. For this reason we divide the sample into J −H bins, and treat bright (K P &lt; 14) and dim (K P &gt; 14) Kepler target stars as two independent samples.</figDesc></figure>

B 1 refers to a mix of atomic lines (Ba II, Fe I, Mn I, and Ti I) which overlap at the resolution of SNIFS (≃ 1300). The TiO5 molecular band is used as a probe of spectral type, although it is also sensitive to metallicity (Lépine et al. 2007). Other atomic and molecular lines are generally much weaker in late type giant stars (Reid &amp; Hawley 2005).
