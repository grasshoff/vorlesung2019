			<abstract>
				<p>We present new results from our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host stars, carried out with the infrared camera SofI at ESO-NTT. We have identified new low mass companions to the planet host stars HD 101930 and HD 65216. HD 101930 AB is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star HD 101930 A and its companion HD 101930 B which is a M0 to M1 dwarf with a mass of about 0.7 M ⊙ separated from the primary by ∼73 arcsec (2200 AU projected separation). HD 65216 forms a hierarchical triple system, with a projected separation of 253 AU (angular separation of about 7 arcsec) between the planet host star HD 65216 A and its close binary companion HD 65216 BC, whose two components are separated by only ∼0.17 arcsec (6 AU of projected separation). Two VLT-NACO images separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet host star. The infrared photometry of HD 65216 B and C is consistent with a M7 to M8 (0.089 M ⊙), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078 M ⊙), respectively , both close to the sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair HD 65216 BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral type. Furthermore, we present Hand K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD 16141 B, the recently detected co-moving companion of the planet host star HD 16141 A. The infrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of HD 16141 B are both fully consistent with a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the distance of the planet host star.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since the mid nineties of the last century high precision radial-velocity studies revealed more than 200 exoplanet candidates around mostly solar-like stars. These planet host stars are located in the solar neighborhood and are mostly isolated single stars. However, already among the first reported planet detections, three planets were found to orbit the brighter component of binary systems, namely 55 Cnc AB, υ And AB and τ Boo AB <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Butler et al. 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Since that time more and more planet host multiple star systems were identified, most of them being found in multiplicity studies of the planet host stars. These studies ⋆ E-mail: markus@astro.uni-jena.de † Based on observations obtained on La Silla in ESO programs 075.C-0098(A), 077.C-0572(A) and 078.C-0376(A), as well as on Paranal in ESO programs 070.C-0557(A), 076.C-0057(A) and 078.C-0376(B).</p><p>are carried out with seeing limited near infrared imaging (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Mugrauer et al. 2004a&amp;b, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">Mugrauer et al. 2004a&amp;b, , 2006a</ref>) as well as high contrast diffraction limited AO observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Patience et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Luhman &amp; Jayawardhana 2002</ref>, and most recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Neuhäuser et al. 2007</ref>). In addition, data from visible and infrared all sky surveys like POSS or 2MASS are used to identify new companions of planet host stars (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bakos et al. 2006</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Raghavan et al. 2006</ref>). Because of all these efforts, more than 30 planet host multiple star systems are known today, suggesting that the multiplicity of planet host stars is at least 20 %.</p><p>Most of the detected stellar companions to planet host stars are low-mass main sequence stars. The projected separations of these companions to the planet host stars range from only a few tens of AU up to more than 5000 AU. In a few cases the companions themselves turned out to be close binaries, i.e. these systems are hierarchical triples (see <ref type="bibr">Mu- grauer et al. 2007</ref> for a summary). Not only main-sequence stars but also white dwarfs were revealed as companions of exoplanet host stars, suggesting that planetary systems also exist in evolved multiple star systems. Three white dwarfs were found so far at close (Gl 86 B, ∼20 AU, see <ref type="bibr">Mu- grauer &amp; Neuhäuser 2005</ref>), intermediate (HD 27442 B at ∼240 AU, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chauvin et al. 2006 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mugrauer et al. 2007</ref>) and at wide separations (HD 147513 B at ∼5400 AU, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mayor et al. 2004</ref>). Recently, the first directly imaged substellar companion of an exoplanet host star, the T7.5±0.5 brown dwarf HD 3651 B, was discovered (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mugrauer et al. 2006b</ref>, Burgasser 2006, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al. 2007, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luhman et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In this letter we present new results of our multiplicity study carried out with the ESO-NTT at La Silla observatory. We have discovered new stellar companions to two planet host stars. We show the results of our near infrared imaging observations in section 2. Section 3 summarizes the infrared H-and K-band spectroscopic data obtained for the new companions presented here, and also for the close planet host star companion HD 16141 B, for which we have already presented the astrometric confirmation of companionship in . In the last section we discuss the properties of the newly found companions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>HD 65216 is a nearby G5 dwarf, located in the southern constellation Carina. Its proper motion and parallax (µαcos(δ) = −122.12 ± 0.98 mas/yr, µ δ = 145.90 ± 0.64 mas/yr, and π = 28.10 ± 0.69 mas) are both determined by Hipparcos ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Perryman et al. 1997)</ref>, yielding a distance of ∼ 36 pc. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Santos et al. (2004)</ref> HD 65216 has an effective temperature of 5666 ± 31 K and a surface gravity of log(g) = 4.53 ± 0.09 cm/s 2 , as expected for a mid G mainsequence star. The same group also determined the mass of the star to be 0.94 M ⊙ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Saffe et al. (2005)</ref> derived an upper age limit for HD 65216 to be 10.2 Gyr, obtained from the stellar metallicity ([F e/H] = −0.12). A variation of the radial velocity of HD 65216 with a period of 613 day is reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mayor et al. (2004)</ref>, indicating that the star is orbited by a Jupiter-mass planet (m · sin(i) = 1.21 MJup) on an eccentric (e = 0.41) orbit with a semi-major axis of a = 1.37 AU.</p><p>HD 101930 is a nearby (31 pc) dwarf of spectral type early K, located in the southern part of the constellation Centaurus, close to the famous constellation Southern Crux. The proper motion and parallax of HD 101930 are both well known from precise Hipparcos measurements (µαcos(δ) = 15.00 ± 1.01 mas/yr, µ δ = 347.49 ± 0.80 mas/yr, and π = 32.79±0.96 mas). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lovis et al. (2005)</ref> determined its effective temperature to 5079 ± 62 K and surface gravity to log(g) = 4.24 ± 0.16 cm/s 2 ). Both values are consistent with an early K dwarf. The authors also derived the mass of this star to be 0.74 M⊙. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Saffe et al. (2005)</ref> the age of HD 101930 ranges between 3.5 and 5.4 Gyr. HD 101930 is chromospherically inactive (logR ′ HK = −4.99 ± 0.02) but shows a periodical modulation of its radial velocity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lovis et al. 2005</ref>). This variation of the stellar radial-velocity is induced by a Saturn-mass exoplanet (m · sin(i) = 0.3 MJup), which orbits the star every 70 days (a = 0.30 AU) on a slightly eccentric orbit (e = 0.11).</p><p>We observed HD 65216 and HD 101930 for our multiplicity study of planet host stars, using the infrared camera SofI at the ESO-NTT at La Silla observatory. All observations were obtained in the H-band with the SofI small-field camera (147 arcsec×147 arcsec field of view). By comparing two images of the planet host stars taken at different observing epochs we can find co-moving companions of these stars and distinguish them from non-or only slowly moving background sources.</p><p>The first epoch observations of HD 65216 and HD 101930 were both obtained in June 2005 with follow-up second epoch imaging one year later in June 2006. In order to limit saturation effects of the detector due to the bright planet host stars, we always used the shortest available integration time (1.2 s), and 50 of these 1.2 s integrations were averaged to one image. The standard dither (jitter) technique was applied to subtract the bright infrared sky background. In total 10 images were taken at 10 different dither positions, resulting in a total integration time of 10 min. The data reduction, i.e. background estimation and subtraction, flat-fielding of all images as well as the final shift and add procedure was done with the ESO data reduction package ECLIPSE (Devillard 2001). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows our second epoch SofI H-band images of HD 65216 and HD 101930, in which the primaries are located in the center of each image.</p><p>All images are astrometrically calibrated with sources detected in our SofI images and listed in the 2MASS point source catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>). The astrometric calibration of both SofI observing runs is summarized in Tab. 2.</p><p>By comparing our first epoch H-band images with the second epoch images we determined the proper motion of all objects (S/N &gt; 10) detected around the planet host stars within the SofI field of view. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>, most of the detected objects have a small or even negligible proper motion. However, we have identified two sources which share the proper motion of the planet host stars, indicated as boxes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. Thus, these sources are co-moving companions of the planet host stars and will be denoted HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B from hereon.</p><p>We measured the H-band photometry and relative astrometry of both detected co-moving companions in our SofI H-band images. The results are summarized in Tab. 2. HD 101930 B is already too bright and exceeds the linearity limit of the SofI detector, hence we cannot give an accurate H-band photometry of this object. However, this object is well detected in 2MASS and accurate photometry (photometric quality flag: AAA) of this companion is listed in the 2MASS point source catalogue (J = 7.940 ± 0.026, H = 7.291 ± 0.049, KS = 7.107 ± 0.024), see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Skrutskie et al. (2006)</ref>. We used the 2MASS astrometry and derived the separation and position angle of HD 101930 B relative to the planet host star at the epoch of the 2MASS observations (see <ref type="table">Tab.</ref> 2).</p><p>HD 101930 B is also listed in the UCAC2 catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zacharias et al. 2004</ref>), in the USNO-B1.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Monet et al. 2003</ref>), as well as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kharchenko (2001)</ref>. The UCAC2 (µαcos(δ) = 25.6 ± 3.3mas/yr, µ δ = 349.2 ± 3.0 mas/yr) and USNO entry (µαcos(δ) = 24 mas/yr, µ δ = 348 mas/yr), as well as the astrometry of HD 101930 B given by Kharchenko (2001) (µαcos(δ) = 24.99 ± 4.02 mas/yr, µ δ = 351.55 ± <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Pixel scale and detector orientation with their uncertainties for all SofI observing runs. The detector is tilted by the given angle from north to west. Furthermore, the separations and position angles of the detected companions HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B relative to their primaries -the exoplanet host stars HD 65216 A and HD 101930 A -as well as their H-band photometry are listed, as measured in all SofI observing epochs.  The detection limit of our SofI H-band images of both planet host stars is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>. We obtain similar limits for both planet host stars. In the background limited region beyond ∼ 15 arcsec (∼530 AU of projected separation in case of HD 65216 and ∼460 AU in case of HD 101930, respectively), a limiting magnitude of H ∼17 mag is achieved. This allows the detection of substellar companions with masses down to ∼65 MJup, if we assume a system age of 5 Gyr for both planet host star. This limit has been derived using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baraffe et al. (2003)</ref> evolutionary models. All stellar companions of the planet host stars are detectable at angular separations larger than ∼5 arcsec (∼180 AU of projected separation in case of HD 65216 A and ∼150 AU in case of HD 101930 A, respectively) up to the edge of the SofI field of view imaged twice in both observing epochs, which is ∼ 67 arcsec (2400 AU of projected separation) around HD 65216 A and ∼59 arcsec (1800 AU of projected separation) around HD 101930 A. Beside HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B no further co-moving companions could be found within the SofI field of view around both planet host stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration</head><p>In the case that both detected co-moving companions are low-mass stars located at the respective distance of their primaries, we can approximate their masses from evolutionary stellar models.</p><p>In the case of HD 65216 B, only its apparent H-band magnitude is known, which is on average H = 12.680 ± 0.045 mag. The distance modulus E = 2.757 ± 0.053 mag of the planet host star was derived from the Hipparcos parallax. With the distance modulus and the apparent magnitude of HD 65216 B we derive its absolute magnitude to be MH = 9.923±0.069 mag. For an assumed age of 5 Gyr for the HD 65216 AB system, we can derive the mass of HD 65216 B from evolutionary models of low-mass stars and substellar objects. According to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref> models, the absolute magnitude of HD 65216 B is consistent with a lowmass star of 0.094 ± 0.002 M⊙.</p><p>In the case of HD 101930 B, optical as well as infrared photometry is available. The Hipparcos parallax of the planet host star HD 101930 A yields a distance modulus E = 2.421 ± 0.064 mag. With the given apparent Hband photometry of the companion we obtain its absolute magnitude MH = 4.870 ± 0.080 mag. If we assume again 5 Gyr as the age of the HD 101930 AB system we obtain 0.666 ± 0.013 M⊙ as the mass of HD 101930 B using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref> evolutionary models as well as the derived absolute H-band photometry of the companion.</p><p>The mass approximations described above have to be confirmed with spectroscopy, i.e. it has to be shown that the detected companions are indeed low-mass stellar objects. In particular companions as faint as HD 65216 B in the near infrared could also be white dwarfs. However, the spectra of these degenerated objects are clearly different to those of low-mass stars. Spectroscopy finally determines the true nature of the companions, which will also confirm their companionship to the planet host stars.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B</head><p>We obtained infrared H-and K-band spectroscopy of HD 65216 B in December 2006 with VLT-ISAAC, the infrared imager and spectrograph on UT1 (Antu) at Paranal observatory. We used ISAAC's low-resolution spectroscopy mode SWS1-LR with the 1 arcsec slit, providing a resolving power of 500 in H-band, and 450 in K-band, with a dispersion of 4.8 ˚ A per pixel in H-band, and 7.2 ˚ A per pixel in K-band.</p><p>In the H-band we took 12 frames each the average of two 30 s integrations, i.e. 12 min of total integration time. In order to remove the high infrared background, the telescope was always nodded 50 arcsec between two positions along the slit. In addition we applied a 5 arcsec dither to the nodding positions in order to avoid that the spectrum always falls on the same pixels on the ISAAC detector. We took 14 frames in  which was taken between the H-and K-band spectroscopy of HD 65216 B. Thus, the airmass difference between science and calibration spectra was minimized to less than 0.1. The spectral response function of ISAAC was determined, using the spectra of the telluric standard and flux-calibrated B3V spectra from the spectral library of <ref type="bibr">Pickles et al. (1998)</ref>.</p><p>The spectra of the wide companion HD 101930 B were taken at the beginning of February 2007 with SofI in its lowresolution spectroscopy mode. We used the grism RED in combination with a 1 arcsec slit, providing a resolving power of 588 in H-and K-band with a dispersion of 10.22Å22Å per pixel. Six frames, each the average of 20 times 3 s integrations, yield a total integration time of 6 min. The NTT was nodded along the direction of the slit between two positions, separated from each other by 37 arcsec. In addition a random dither of 2 arcsec was applied around both nodding positions. A spectrum of a Xenon lamp was taken for wavelength calibration. All frames were flat-fielded and the indi- vidual spectra were extracted, wavelength calibrated and finally averaged using again standard IRAF routines. We took a spectrum of the telluric standard HIP 54930 (B1V) immediately after HD 101930 B to minimize airmass difference between the science and calibration observations to less than 0.1. Telluric features in the spectra of HD 101930 B were removed with the spectra of the telluric standard, which was again used together with the flux-calibrated spectra from the spectral library of <ref type="bibr">Pickles et al. (1998)</ref> to determine the spectral response function of SofI.</p><p>The reduced and flux-calibrated H-and K-band spectra of HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. We compare the H-and K-band spectra of both companions with template spectra from the IRTF spectral library ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cushing et al. 2005</ref>). To compare our SofI and ISAAC spectra with these templates, the template spectra where smoothed to the same resolution (∆λ/λ = 1/500) in the Hand K-band.</p><p>The continua of the H-and K-band spectra of HD 65216 B as well as all detected atomic and molecular features are mostly consistent with comparison spectra of spectral type M7V and M8V. In the H-band the most prominent features in the spectrum of HD 65216 B are those of Potassium at 1.517 µm, the line series of FeH (strongest feature at 1.625 µm) as well as the flux depression induced by H2O at wavelength longer than 1.75 µm. The overall shape of the continuum in the H-band is due to collision induced absorption (CIA) by H2. In the K-band atomic features of Sodium (Na doublet at 2.208 µm) and Calcium (doublet at 2.265 µm) are detected. However, the strongest features in the K-band spectrum are those of the CO series extending from the band head at 2.294 µm to longer wavelength. At wavelength longer than 2.3 µm we see again a flux depression induced by H2O, typical for a dwarf of spectral type M7 to M8.</p><p>In the H-band spectrum of HD 101930 B the most prominent spectral features are the atomic absorbtion lines of Magnesium at 1.504 µm, 1.576 µm, 1.711 µm, Silicium at 1.589 µm and Aluminium at 1.674 µm. The detected absorption features as well as the continuum of the H-Band spectrum of the companion are consistent with those of comparison spectra of M0 to M1 dwarfs.</p><p>The same holds for the K-band spectrum of HD 101930 B where we find the strong absorption line doublets of Sodium at 2.208 µm and Calcium 2.265 µm as well as the CO absorption band at wavelength longer than 2.294 µm. In addition the weaker absorption lines of the Sodium doublet at 2.337 µm, the absorption lines of Magnesium at 2.107 µm and 2.282 µm, as well as Aluminium at 2.117 µm are detected.</p><p>The determined spectral types of HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B are fully consistent with the apparent magnitudes of both co-moving companions if one assumes that both objects are located at the distances of the planet host stars, as it is expected for real companions. Hence, the companionship of HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B revealed first by astrometry is finally confirmed by photometry and spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">HD 16141 B</head><p>We reported a co-moving companion located ∼6 arcsec (∼220 AU of projected separation) south of the planet host star HD 16141 in . We determined the H-band photometry of the companion to be H = 10.062 ± 0.049 mag. With the known distance of the planet host star (Hipparcos parallax π = 27.85 ± 1.39 mas) this yields MH = 7.286±0.119 mag as absolute magnitude of the companion. By assuming that the companion is a low-mass stellar object the mass of the companion was determined using again the stellar evolutionary models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref>. For an assumed age of the companion of 5 Gyr we obtain 0.286 ± 0.017 M⊙. The expected color of such an object is also given by the models to V − K = 4.52 ± 0.06 mag. According to the spectral type -color relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kenyon &amp; Hartmann (1995)</ref> the derived color is consistent with a M3 dwarf.</p><p>In order to confirm this result and to finally to deter- mine the true nature of HD 16141 B we obtained follow-up spectra in October 2006 with ISAAC, using the same setup as for HD 65216 B. For correction of telluric features and for the flux-calibration we observed the telluric standard Hip 15188 (B3V). The reduced H-and K-band spectra of HD 16141 B are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. The continua of the H-and K-band spectra as well as all detected atomic and molecular absorption features are consistent with a spectral type in the range M2V to M3V, i.e. HD 16141 B is a low mass stellar object as it was already expected from its photometry, adopting the distance of the planet host star for its companion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>As described in the last two sections we can confirm the companionship of HD 65216 B and HD 101930 B detected first by astrometry as co-moving objects to the planet host stars HD 65216 A and HD 101930 A, with photometry and spectroscopy. The photometry of both companions is consistent with low-mass stellar objects located at the distances of the planet host stars, which is finally confirmed with ISAAC and SofI spectroscopy.</p><p>HD 101930 B is separated from its primary by ∼73 arcsec which corresponds to a projected separation of 2229 AU at the distance of the planet host star HD 101930 A. With the mass of the planet host star (0.74 M⊙) and its stellar companion (0.666 M⊙) as well as with the separation of the system we can approximate the longtime stable region for additional companions as derived by <ref type="bibr">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref> for assumed circular companion orbits. By assuming an orbital eccentricity e = 0.5 for HD 101930 B we obtain ac=270 AU and ac=633 AU for a circular (e = 0) orbit, respectively. Thus, the planet of HD 101930 A clearly resides well within the longtime stable region of its host star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evidence for the binarity of HD 65216 B</head><p>HD 65216 B is separated from its primary by ∼7 arcsec which corresponds to a projected separation of 253 AU at the distance of the planet host star HD 65216 A. Besides our SofI H-band observations the HD 65216 system was also observed with the adaptive optics system NACO at UT4 (Yepun) at Paranal observatory. We retrieved public data from the ESO archive obtained with the S27 camera (pixel scale: 27.15 mas per pixel and 28 arcsec×28 arcsec field of view) of NACO in December 2002 and December 2005. In the first observing run 28 frames, each the average of two 15 s integrations, were taken in dither mode through the narrow band filter NB2.17 and the neutral density filter NDSHORT, i.e. 14 min of total integration time. In the second run again 28 frames were taken in dither mode, each the average of 60 integrations of 0.5 s through the narrow band filter NB2.17, i.e. again 14 min of total integration time. The images were flat-fielded and combined using the data reduction package ECLIPSE <ref type="bibr">(Dev- illard 2001)</ref>. At the position of HD 65216 B two objects are detected which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref> for both NACO observing epochs.</p><p>The brighter source B is separated by only 189 ± 11 mas from the fainter object C in the first epoch NACO image from December 2002 (they could also be called Ba and Bb, but we prefer B and C). In the second epoch NACO image both sources are separated by only 146 ± 3 mas, i.e. the separation significantly decreased by ∆sep = −43 ± 12 mas. If we assume that the brighter component B follows the proper motion of the planet host star but the faint source C is just a non-moving background source, the expected change of separation should be much larger, namely ∆sep = −423 mas (15.6 NACO S27-pixels) for the given epoch difference between both NACO observation runs. This expected change of separation is about ten times larger than the one we measured. Hence, we conclude that B and C are co-moving objects, i.e. the HD 65216 system is a hierarchical triple system composed of the planet host star HD 65216 A which is orbited by the close binary system HD 65216 BC at a wide separation (253 AU) and by a planet candidate at close separation (1.37 AU).</p><p>The measured change of the separation between the B and C components can be explained by orbital motion of the B and C components around their common center of mass. In order to estimate this orbital motion we have to determine first the masses of both components.</p><p>In the second epoch narrow band NACO images all three components of the HD 65216 system are detected within the linearity limit of the NACO detector. We determine a magnitude difference of ∆NB2.17(AB) = 6.31 ± 0.02 mag and ∆NB2.17(AC) = 7.32 ± 0.05 mag. With the given 2MASS KS-band magnitude of HD 65216 A we can approximate the KS-band magnitudes of HD 65216 B and C and obtain KS(B) = 12.64 ± 0.03 mag and KS(C) = 13.65 ± 0.06 mag. With the known distance of the planet host star this finally yields the absolute KS-band magnitudes of the two components MKs(B) = 9.88 ± 0.06 mag and MK S (C) = 10.89 ± 0.08 mag.</p><p>According to the spectral type -magnitude relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cruz et al. (2003)</ref> these values are consistent with low-mass objects of spectral type M7 to M8 for HD 65216 B and L2 to L3 for HD 65216 C. The absolute H-band magnitude of a M7 to M8 dwarf is MH = 10.3 ± 0.3 mag and MH = 11.5 ± 0.2 mag for objects of spectral types between L2 to L3. The same result is obtained by an independent analysis of the same public NACO datasets done by A. Eggenberger (private communication), see <ref type="bibr">Eggen- berger et al. (2007, in preparation)</ref>. Hence, the total magnitude of the unresolved HD 65216 BC system should be MH = 9.99 ± 0.24 mag, which corresponds to an apparent magnitude of H = 12.75 ± 0.25 mag at the distance of the planet host star. It is worth to mention that the SofI H-band photometry of the unresolved pair HD 65216 BC H = 12.680 ± 0.045 mag is fully consistent with the derived magnitude estimate.</p><p>If we assume a system age of 5 Gyr we can use again the <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baraffe et al. (1998)</ref> models to derive the masses of both components. We obtain 0.089 ± 0.001 M⊙ for HD 65216 B and 0.078 ± 0.001 M⊙ for HD 65216 C, respectively (since the system is older according to its metallicity, the true masses may be slightly larger). Hence the total mass of HD 65216 BC is 0.167 M⊙. The average separation of both components is 167 mas, which corresponds to a projected separation of 6 AU at the distance of the planet host star. We can use this separation as estimate for the semi-major axis of the system and finally derive its orbital period using Kepler's third law, which yields 36 years. The maximal expected change of separation between both components is 19 mas/yr. Thus, for an epoch difference of three years the expected maximal change of separation due to orbital motion should be smaller than 57 mas. Indeed, the measured change of separation between HD 65216 B and C (∆sep = −43±12 mas) can be explained with orbital motion of both objects around their barycenter. This relatively short orbital motion is important, because it will yield directly determined masses from astrometry and Kepler's third law within a few decades, which are very rare at such late spectral types and low masses, hence will be very useful for calibrating models and to constrain the mass-luminosity relation at the low-mass end.</p><p>Finally, we can determine the radius of the longterm stable region around the planet host star, using again the approximation of <ref type="bibr">Holman &amp; Wiegert (1999)</ref> and the derived masses of HD 65216 B and C (total mass 0.167 M⊙), the mass of the planet host star (0.94 M⊙) as well as the projected separation between the star and its binary companion (253 AU). We obtain ac = 42 AU for an assumed eccentric orbit of HD 65216 BC with e = 0.5 and ac = 103 AU for a circular orbit, respectively.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2</head><label></label><figDesc>.36 mas/yr) are fully consistent with our conclusion that this object and the planet host star HD 101930 A form a common proper motion pair.
