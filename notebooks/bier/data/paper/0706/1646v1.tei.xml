				<p>Aims. To investigate the astrometric effects of stellar surface structures as a practical limitation to ultra-high-precision astrometry, e.g. in the context of exoplanet searches, and to quantify the expected effects in different regions of the HR-diagram. Methods. Stellar surface structures (spots, plages, granulation, non-radial oscillations) are likely to produce fluctuations in the integrated flux and radial velocity of the star, as well as a variation of the observed photocentre, i.e. astrometric jitter. We use theoretical considerations supported by Monte Carlo simulations (using a starspot model) to derive statistical relations between the corresponding astrometric, photometric, and radial-velocity effects. Based on these relations, the more easily observed photometric and radial-velocity variations can be used to predict the expected size of the astrometric jitter. Also the third moment of the brightness distribution, interferometrically observable as closure phase, contains information about the astrometric jitter. Results. For most stellar types the astrometric jitter due to stellar surface structures is expected to be of order 10 micro-AU or greater. This is more than the astrometric displacement typically caused by an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable zone, which is about 1-4 micro-AU for long-lived main-sequence stars. Only for stars with extremely low photometric variability (&lt; 0.5 mmag) and low magnetic activity, comparable to that of the Sun, will the astrometric jitter be of order 1 micro-AU, sufficient to allow the astrometric detection of an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. While stellar surface structure may thus seriously impair the astrometric detection of small exoplanets, it has in general negligible impact on the detection of large (Jupiter-size) planets and on the determination of stellar parallax and proper motion. From the starspot model we also conclude that the commonly used spot filling factor is not the most relevant parameter for quantifying the spottiness in terms of the resulting astrometric, photometric and radial-velocity variations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The accuracy of astrometric measurements has improved tremendously in the past decades as a result of new techniques being introduced, both on the ground and in space. This development will continue in the next decade, e.g Gaia is to improve parallax accuracy by another two orders of magnitude compared with Hipparcos. As a result, trigonometric distances will be obtained for the Magellanic Clouds, and thousands of Jupiter-size exoplanets are likely to be found from the astrometric wobbles of their parent stars. Even before that, ground-based interferometric techniques are expected to reach similar precisions for relative measurements within a small field. How far should we expect this trend to continue? Will nanoarcsec astrometry soon be a reality, with parallaxes measured to cosmological distances and Earth-size planets found wherever we look? Or will the accuracy ultimately be limited by other factors such as variable optical structure in the targets and weak microlensing in the Galactic halo? The aim of this project is to assess the importance of such limitations for ultra-high-precision astrometry. In this paper we consider the effects of stellar surface structures found on ordinary stars.</p><p>Future high-precision astrometric observations will in many cases be able to detect the very small shifts in stellar positions</p><p>Send offprint requests to: U. Eriksson, e-mail: urban@astro.lu.se caused by surface structures. In some cases, e.g. for a rotating spotted star, the shifts are periodic and could mimic the dynamical pull of a planetary companion, or even the star's parallax motion, if the period is close to one year. These shifts are currently of great interest as a possible limitation of the astrometric method in search for Earth-like exoplanets. We want to estimate how important these effects are for different types of stars, especially in view of current and future astrometric exoplanet searches such as VLTI-PRIMA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reffert et al. 2005</ref>), SIM PlanetQuest (Unwin 2005) and Gaia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lattanzi et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>Astrometric observations determine the position of the centre of gravity of the stellar light, or what we call the photocentre. This is an integrated property of the star (the first moment of the intensity distribution across the disk), in the same sense as the total flux (the zeroth moment of the intensity distribution) or stellar spectrum (the zeroth moment as function of wavelength). In stars other than the Sun, information about surface structures usually come from integrated properties such as light curves and spectrum variations. For example, Doppler imaging (DI) has become an established technique to map the surfaces of rapidly rotating, cool stars. Unfortunately, it cannot be applied to most of the targets of interest for exoplanet searches, e.g. low-activity solartype stars. Optical or infrared interferometric (aperture synthesis) imaging does not have this limitation, but is with current baselines (&lt; 1 km) in practice limited to giant stars and other extended objects (see <ref type="bibr">Monnier et al. 2006</ref> for a review on recent advances in stellar interferometry). Interferometry of marginally resolved stars may, however, provide some information about surface structures through the closure phase, which is sensitive to the third central moment (asymmetry) of the stellar intensity distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Monnier 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lachaume 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Labeyrie et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Since there is limited information about surface structures on most types of stars, an interesting question is whether we can use more readily accessible photometric and spectroscopic data to infer something about possible astrometric effects. For example, dark or bright spots on a rotating star will in general cause periodic variations both in the integrated flux and in the radial velocity of the star, as well as in the photocentre and the asymmetry of the intensity distribution. Thus, we should at least expect the astrometric effect to be statistically related to the other effects.</p><p>We show that there are in fact relatively well-defined statistical relations between variations in the photocentre, total flux, closure phase and radial velocity for a wide range of possible surface phenomena. These relations are in the following used to predict the astrometric jitter in various types of stars, without any detailed knowledge of their actual surface structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Astrometric limits from previous studies</head><p>The discovery of exoplanets by means of high-precision radial velocity measurements has triggered an interest in how astrophysical phenomena such as magnetic activity and convective motions might affect the observed velocities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Saar et al. 2003</ref>). Evidence for dark spots have been seen photometrically and spectroscopically for many cool stars other than the Sun, and quantified in terms of an empirically determined spot filling factor 1 f , ranging from ≪ 1% for old, inactive stars to several percent for active stars. It is therefore natural to relate the expected radial-velocity effects to the spot filling factor. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Saar &amp; Donahue (1997)</ref> used a simple model consisting of a single black equatorial spot on a rotating solar-like star to derive the following relation between f (in percent), the projected rotational velocity V sin i and the amplitude ∆v r of the resulting radial velocity variations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆v r = 0.0065 f 0.9 V sin i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In a similar vein, Hatzes (2002) estimated both the radial velocity amplitude and the corresponding astrometric effect from a similar model, but assuming a fixed spot size (2 • radius) and instead varying the number of spots placed randomly on the stellar surface centred around the equator. For the radial velocity amplitude they found</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆v r = (0.0086 V sin i − 0.0016) f 0.9 (2)</formula><p>in approximate agreement with (1), while the total amplitude of the astrometric effect (converted to linear distance) was ∆pos = (7.1 × 10 −5 AU) f 0.92 (3)</p><p>Reffert et al. (2005) discuss the accuracy and limitations of the PRIMA (Phase-Referenced Imaging and Micro-Arcsecond Astrometry) facility at the VLT Interferometer in the context of the search for suitable targets for exoplanetary searches, reference and calibrations stars. According to their calculations, a spot filling factor of f = 2% would move the photocentre of a G0V star by about 3 × 10 −5 AU, roughly a factor 4 less than according to (3). They also conclude that the corresponding brightness variation is less than 2%.</p><p>But f alone may not be a very good way to quantify the 'spottiness'. For example, the photometric or astrometric effects of a large single spot are obviously very different from those of a surface scattered with many small spots, although the spot filling factor may be the same in the two cases. Therefore, more detailed (or more general) models may be required to explore the plausible ranges of the astrometric effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bastian &amp; Hefele (2005)</ref> give an assessment of the astrometric effects of starspots, and conclude that they are hard to quantify, mostly because of the insufficient statistics. Although starspots are common among cool stars with outer convective zones, data are strongly biased towards very active stars. They conclude that the effects on solar-type stars are likely to be negligible for Gaia, while much larger spots on K giants may become detectable. For supergiants and M giants, having radii of the order of 100R ⊙ (or more), the effect may reach 0.25 AU (or more), which could confuse the measurement of parallax and proper motion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sozzetti (2005)</ref> gives an interesting review of the astrometric methods to identify and characterize extrasolar planets. As an example of the astrophysical noise sources affecting the astrometric measurements, he considers a distribution of spots on the surface of a pre-mainsequence (T Tauri) star. For a star with radius 1R ⊙ seen at a distance of 140 pc, he finds that a variation of the flux in the visual by ∆F/F = 10% (rms) corresponds to an astrometric variation of ∼ 3 µas (rms), and that the two effects are roughly proportional.</p><p>While the astrometric effects cannot yet be tested observationally, it is possible to correlate the photometric and radial-velocity variations for some stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Queloz et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Henry et al. 2002)</ref>. From a small sample of Hyades stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Paulson et al. (2004b)</ref> found an approximately linear relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">σ v R ≃ 2 + 3600 σ m [m s −1 ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>between the RMS scatter in Strömgren y magnitude (σ m ) and in radial velocity (σ v R ). This relation supports the idea that a large part of the radial-velocity scatter in these stars is caused by surface structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Svensson &amp; Ludwig (2005)</ref> have computed hydrodynamical model atmospheres for a range of stellar types, predicting both the photometric and astrometric jitter caused by granulation. They find that the computed astrometric jitter is almost entirely determined by the surface gravity g of the atmosphere model, and is proportional to g −1 for a wide range of models. This relationship is explained by the increased granular cell size with increasing pressure scale height or decreasing g. The radius of the star does not enter the relation, except via g, since the increased leverage of a large stellar disk is compensated by the averaging over more granulation cells. For their most extreme model, a bright red giant with log g = 1 (R/R ⊙ ≃ 95) they find σ pos ≃ 300 µAU. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ludwig &amp; Beckers (2005)</ref> extended this by considering the effects of granulation on interferometric observations of red supergiants. They show that both visibilities and closure phases may carry clear signatures of deviations from circular symmetry for this type of stars, and conclude that convection-related surface structures may thus be observable using interferometry.</p><p>Ludwig (2006) outlines a statistical procedure to characterise the photometric and astrometric effects of granulation-related micro-variability in hydrodynamical simulations of convective U.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Relations for the astrometric jitter</head><p>In a coordinate system xyz with origin at the centre of the star and +z away from the observer, let I(r, t) be the instantaneous surface brightness of the star at point r = (x, y, z) on the visible surface, i.e. the specific intensity in the direction of the observer. We are interested in the integrated properties: total flux F(t), photocentre offsets ∆x(t), ∆y(t) in the directions perpendicular to the line of sight, the third central moment of the intensity distribution µ 3 (t), and the radial velocity offset ∆v R (t). These are given by the following integrals over the visible surface S (z &lt; 0):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F(t) = S I(r, t)µ dS (6) ∆x(t) = 1 F(t) S I(r, t)xµ dS (7) ∆y(t) = 1 F(t) S I(r, t)yµ dS (8) µ 3 (t) = 1 F(t) S I(r, t) [x − ∆x(t)] 3 µ dS (9) ∆v R (t) = 1 F(t) S I(r, t) [(ω × r) · ˆ z] µ dS (10)</formula><p>where µ = |z|/R is the geometrical projection factor applied to the surface element when projected onto the sky, ω is the angular velocity of the star andˆzandˆandˆz the unit vector along +z. (For the third moment, only the pure x component is considered above.) Equation (10) assumes that the star rotates as a rigid body, that rotation is the only cause of the radial-velocity offset, and that the overall offset can be calculated as the intensity-weighted mean value of the local offset across the surface. The flux variation expressed in magnitudes is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∆m(t) = 1.086 F(t) − −F F (11)</formula><p>where F is the time-averaged flux.</p><p>Using a similar statistical method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ludwig (2006)</ref>, the RMS variations (dispersions) of m(t), ∆x(t), ∆y(t) and µ 3 (t) can be estimated from fairly general assumptions about the surface brightness fluctuations (Appendix A). This calculation is approximately valid whether the fluctuations are caused by dark or bright spots, granulation, or a combination of all three, and whether or not the time variation is caused by the rotation of the star or by the changing brightness distribution over the surface. The result is a set of proportionality relations involving the radius of the star R, the limb-darkening factor a, and the centreto-limb variation c of the surface structure contrast [see (A.5) and (A.18) for the definition of a and c]. For a = 0.6 (typical solar limb-darkening in visible light) and c = 0 (no centre-to-limb variation of contrast) we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ ∆x = σ ∆y ≡ σ pos ≃ 0.376 R σ m (12) σ µ 3 ≃ 0.139 R 3 σ m<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where σ q designates the dispersion of the quantity q. For the radial-velocity dispersion, a similar relation can be derived under the previously mentioned conditions of a timeindependent, rigidly rotating star.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Modeling discrete spots</head><p>As a check of the general relations in Sect. 3.1 we have made numerical simulations with a very simple model, consisting of a limited number of (dark or bright) spots on the surface of a rotating star. The behaviour of the integrated properties are readily understood in this case (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>):</p><p>-the flux is reduced in proportion to the total projected area of the visible spots (or the spot filling factor f ); -a black spot on, say, the +x side of the star will shift the photocentre in the −x direction and cause a negative skewness of the flux distribution along the x direction; -the apparent radial velocity of the star is modified, depending on whether the dark spot is located on the part of the disk moving towards the observer (giving ∆v R &gt; 0) or away from the observer (∆v R &lt; 0) (Gray 2005, p. 496 and references therein).</p><p>Bright spots cause similar effects but with the opposite sign. Limb darkening of the stellar disk and a possible centre-to-limb variation of spot contrast will modify the precise amount of these shifts, but not their qualitative behaviour. We assume a spherical star with N spots that are:</p><p>-absolutely black, -small compared to the stellar radius R, -of equal area A (measured as a fraction of the total surface), -randomly spread over the whole stellar surface, and -fixed in position on the surface, while the star rotates. For circular spots of angular radius ρ (as seen from the centre of the star), we have A = sin 2 (ρ/2). The assumption of absolutely black spots is uncritical if we interpret A as the equivalent area of the spot, i.e. the area of a completely black spot causing the same drop in flux. Bright spots can formally be handled by allowing negative A. The star is assumed to rotate as a rigid body with period P around an axis that is tilted an angle i to the line of sight (+z). For the present experiments we take the +y direction to coincide with the projection of the rotation vector ω onto the sky; thus ω x = 0, ω y = ω sin i, and ω z = ω cos i, where ω = 2π/P. Limb darkening of the form intensity ∝ 1 − a + aµ is assumed, where µ = |z|/R.</p><p>To model a rotating spotted star, we place the N spots of the given size A randomly on the surface of a spherical star and tilt the axis to a certain inclination i. Letting the star rotate around its axis we calculate the integrated quantities as functions of the rotational phase, taking into account the projection effect on the area of each spot (by the factor µ) as well the limb-darkening law.</p><p>The effects of a single black spot as function of the rotational phase are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. It can be noted that the effects are not unrelated to each other; for example, the radial-velocity curve mirrors the displacement in x, and both of these curves look like the derivative of the photometric curve. This is not a coincidence but can be understood from fairly general relations like <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. With many spots the curves become quite complicated, but some of the basic relationships between them remain.</p><p>The total equivalent area of the spots is AN (the spot filling factor f ≃ 2AN). As long as AN ≪ 1, all the effects are proportional to A. The dependence on N is more complex because of the random distribution of spots. For example, the photometric effect will mainly depend on the actual number of spots k visible at any time. For any random realization of the model, k follows a binomial distribution with parameters p = 0.5 and N; its dispersion is therefore √ N/2. We can therefore expect the RMS photometric effect to be roughly proportional to A √ N. Similar arguments (with the same result) can be made for the other effects. Monte Carlo simulations of a large number of cases with A = 0.0025 (spot radius ρ = 5.73 • ) and N in the range from 1 to 50 (assuming random orientation of the rotation axis and a limbdarkening parameter a = 0.6) indeed show that the RMS effects in magnitude, photocentre displacements, third central moment and radial velocity are all, in a statistical sense, proportional to √ N ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>). More precisely we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">σ m ≃ (1.17 ± 0.60) · A √ N (19) σ pos ≃ (0.57 ± 0.25) · A √ N · R (20) σ µ 3 ≃ (0.22 ± 0.09) · A √ N · R 3 (21) σ v R ≃ (0.51 ± 0.26) · A √ N · R ω (22)</formula><p>where the values after ± show the RMS dispersion of the proportionality factor found among the different simulations. The relations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>- <ref type="formula">(22)</ref> suggest that a measurement of any one of the four dispersions can be used to statistically predict the other three dispersions, assuming that we know the approximate radius and rotation period of the star, and that the different effects are indeed caused by the rotating spotted surface. An important point is that it is not necessary to know A or N in order to do this. For example, expressing the other effects in terms of the photometric variation we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">σ pos ≃ 0.49 R σ m (23) σ µ 3 ≃ 0.19 R 3 σ m (24) σ v R ≃ 0.43 R ω σ m<label>(25)</label></formula><p>Comparing these relations with the theoretical results in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> we find that the numerical factors from the numerical experiments are systematically some 30-40% larger than according to the statistical theory. This discrepancy largely vanishes if the models are constrained to high inclinations (i ≃ ±90 • ). This suggests that the discrepancy is mainly caused by the small values of σ m obtained in models with small inclinations, i.e. when the star is seen nearly pole-on. The differences in these factors are in any case well within the scatter indicated in Eq. 23-25, which emphasizes the statistical nature of the predictions based e.g. on photometric variations. It should also be noted that there is a considerable scatter between the different realisations reported in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>- <ref type="formula">(22)</ref>, amounting to about 50% RMS about the mean RMS effect. Thus, any prediction based on either (12)- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref>- <ref type="formula">(22)</ref> is only valid in a statistical sense, with considerable uncertainty in any individual case. Nevertheless, the overall agreement between the results of these very different models suggests that the statistical relations among the different effects have a fairly general validity. The expressions for σ v R are the least general in this respect, as they obviously break down if the structures change on a time scale smaller than P, or if the surface structures themselves have velocity fields. Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> do not depend on the assumption that the variability is caused by the rotation.</p><p>When modeling spotted stars, any brightening effect of faculae is often disregarded (for more details see Aarum-Ulvås 2005); only the darkening effect of spots is computed. For the Sun, the effect of faculae is known to be comparable and sometimes even larger than the darkening effect of sunspots ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eker et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapman 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman &amp; Meyer 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chapman et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Steinegger et al. 1996</ref>). However, since the general relationships, e.g. in (12)-(18), are equally valid for bright and dark spots (or any mixture of them), it should still be possible to predict the astrometric effects from the photometric variations.</p></div>

(1)-(3) is not supported by our spotted model, which predicts that the effects are proportional to A √ N. However, for small N and a filling factor of a few percent we have rough quantitative agreement with these earlier results. We note that (2) and (3) can be combined to give an approximate relation similar to <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>.

Rather than using angular units, we consistently express the astrometric jitter in linear units, using the astronomical unit AU, mAU (10 −3 AU) or µAU (10 −6 AU). This eliminates the dependence on the distance to the star, while providing simple conversion to angular units: 1 µAU corresponds to 1 µas at a distance of 1 pc. We also note that 1 mAU ≃ 0.215R ⊙ and 1 µAU ≃ 150 km.</p></div>

From the observations of ∼450 stars in the California and Carnegie Planet Search Program, Wright (2005) finds a radial velocity jitter of ∼ 4 m s −1 for inactive dwarf stars of spectral type F5 or later, increasing to some 10 m s −1 for stars that are either active or more evolved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Saar et al.

The most stable giants (σ m &lt; 2 mmag) are the early A and late G types. The most unstable ones are of type K8 or later, with a steadily increasing variability up to ∼ 0.1 mag for late M giants. The stars in the instability strip (roughly from A8 to F6) are typically variable at the 5-20 mmag level. As these are presumably mainly radially pulsating, the expected astrometric jitter is not necessarily higher than on either side of the instability strip. This general picture is confirmed by other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jorissen et al.

This is based on the assumption that the variability is due either to (dark or bright) spots, granulation, or any other surface features that vary with time. Note that the temporal variation need not be related to stellar rotation. The resulting σ pos are probably realistic order-of-magnitude estimates except when the photometric variability is mainly caused by radial pulsations. In such cases (e.g., for stars in the instability strip and red supergiants) the values given clearly represent upper limits to the real effect. -Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> is used to predict the astrometric effect from the radial-velocity variability in column σ v R . This is only valid if the radial velocity is rotationally modulated. Since pulsations, non-radial oscillations, convection and many other effects may cause radial-velocity variations without a corresponding astrometric effect, these estimates are again upper limits. Nevertheless, rotational modulation is important among active (young) main-sequence stars and M dwarfs, and for these objects Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> may provide correct order-of-magnitude estimates. -Finally we have included an estimate of the astrometric jitter based on the following equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">σ pos = (300 µAU) × 10 1−log g<label>(27)</label></formula><p>with log g taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cox (2000)</ref>.

Although the authors warn that sphericity effects may render an extrapolation of this relation to supergiants very uncertain, we have applied it to all the stellar types in the table. Since it only includes the random effects of stellar granulation, it represents a lower limit to the expected astrometric jitter.</p><p>If the estimates based on the photometric and radial-velocity estimates are strictly considered as upper limits, the results in the table appear rather inconclusive. However, if the likely mechanisms of the variabilities are also considered, it is possible to make some quantitative conclusions. For main-sequence A to M stars, the expected level of astrometric jitter is generally in the range 2-20 µAU probably depending mainly on the level of stellar activity; old, inactive stars should have less jitter (2-5 µAU). The Sun appears to be more stable than the typical old, solar-like star, but not by a large factor. The most stable giant stars are the late F to early K types, were the expected astrometric jitter is of order 25 µAU.

A very simplistic assumption might be that detection is only possible if the RMS perturbation from the planet exceeds the RMS noise from other causes. Neglecting orbital eccentricity and assuming that the orbital plane is randomly oriented in space, so that sin 2 i = 2/3, the RMS positional excursion of the star in a given direction on the sky is α/ √ 3. With a sufficiently powerful instrument, so that other error sources can be neglected, the condition for detection then becomes α/σ pos &gt; ∼ √ 3.

We consider here only briefly the possible effects of stellar surface structures on the determination of these quantities.</p><p>Stellar parallax causes an apparent motion of the star, known as the parallax ellipse, which is an inverted image the Earth's orbit as viewed from the star. The linear amplitude of the parallax effect is therefore very close to 1 AU. (For a space observatory at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L 2 , such as Gaia, the mean amplitude is 1.01 AU.) Thus, the size of the astrometric jitter expressed in AU can directly be used to estimate the minimum achievable relative error in parallax. For main-sequence stars this relative error is less than 10 −4 , for giant stars it is of order 10 −4 to 10 −3 , and for supergiants it may in some cases exceed 1%. We note that a 1% relative error in parallax gives a 2% (0.02 mag) error in luminosity or absolute magnitude.</p><p>If proper motions are calculated from positional data separated by T years, the random error caused by the astrometric jitter, converted to transverse velocity, is ≃ σ pos √ 2/T . Even for a very short temporal baseline such as T = 1 yr, this error is usually very small: ∼0.1 m s −1 for main-sequence stars and ∼0.5-5 m s −1 for giants. (Note that 1 AU yr −1 ≃ 4.74 km s −1 .)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>For most instruments on ground or in space, stars are still unresolved or marginally resolved objects that can only be observed by their disk-integrated properties. The total flux, astrometric position, effective radial velocity and closure phase are examples of such integrated properties. Stellar surface structures influence all of them in different ways. Our main conclusions are:</p><p>1. Theoretical considerations allow to establish statistical relations between the different integrated properties of stars.</p><p>Under certain assumptions these relations can be used to pre-U. Eriksson and L. Lindegren: Limits of ultra-high-precision optical astrometry: Stellar surface structures 9 dict the astrometric jitter from observed variations in photometry, radial velocity or closure phase. 2. The total flux, astrometric position and third central moments (related to closure phase) are simple moments of the intensity distribution over the disk, and for these the statistical relations are valid under fairly general conditions -for example, they hold irrespective of whether the variations are caused by spots on a rotating star or by the temporal evolution of granulation. By contrast, radial-velocity variations can only be coupled to photometric and astrometric variations if they are primarily caused by rotational modulation. 3. The theoretical relations are supported by numerical simulations using a model of a rotating spotted star. In this case the variations in total flux, position, radial velocity and closure phase are all proportional to A √ N, where A is the equivalent area of each spot and N the number of spots. This means that, e.g., the astrometric jitter can be (statistically) predicted from the photometric variability without knowing A and N. It is noted that the spot filling factor, being proportional to AN, is not the most relevant characteristic of spottiness for these effects. 4. Using typical values for the observed photometric and radialvelocity variations in ordinary stars, we have estimated the expected size of the astrometric jitter caused by surface structures <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). The estimates range from below 1 µAU for the Sun, several µAU for most main-sequence stars, some tens of µAU for giants, and up to several mAU for some supergiants. 5. The expected positional jitter has implications for the possible astrometric detection of exoplanets. While planets heavier than 10 Earth masses may be astrometrically detected in the habitable zone around ordinary main-sequence stars, it is likely that Earth-sized planets can only be detected around stars that are unusually stable for their type, similar to our Sun. 6. Stellar surface structures in general have negligible impact on other astrometric applications, such as the determination of parallax and proper motion. A possible exception are supergiants, where very large and slowly varying spots or convection cells could limit the relative accuracy of parallax determinations to a few per cent.</p></div>

As a consequence, the spatial moments (A.1) and (A.2) are also random functions of time, and the goal is to characterize them in terms of their mean values and variances. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Since we are interested in quite small effects of the surface structure it is generally true that the dispersions are small compared with the total flux and scale of the star, so that for example D <ref type="bibr">[M 00</ref> ] ≪ E[M 00 ] and D <ref type="bibr">[M 10</ref> ] ≪ R E[M 00 ]. In this case the variability of x m y n is mainly produced by the numerator in (A.2), and we may use the approximations</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">E[x m y n ] = E[M mn ] E[M 00 ] , D[x m y n ] = D[M mn ] E[M 00 ] (A.3)</formula><p>In the following we therefore focus on deriving the mean values and dispersions of the non-normalized moments M mn .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Dispersion of the moments</head><p>In order to compute the dispersion of M mn we need to introduce the second-order statistics of I(µ, ϕ). Following Ludwig (2006) we divide the visible hemisphere into N equal surface patches of size ∆A = R 2 ∆θ∆ϕ sin θ = R 2 ∆µ∆ϕ = 2πR 2 /N, with the centre of patch k at position (µ k , ϕ k ). Thus the integral over the visible surface of any function g(µ, ϕ) can in the limit of large N be replaced by a sum:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">R 2 1 0 dµ 2π 0 dϕ g(µ, ϕ) ≃ 2πR 2 N N k=1 g(µ k , ϕ k ) (A.14)</formula><p>In particular, from (A.1) we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">M mn = 2πR m+n+2 N N k=1 I k µ k (1 − µ 2 k ) (m+n)/2 cos m ϕ k sin n ϕ k (A.15)</formula><p>where I k is the mean value of I(µ, ϕ) in patch k. This expresses the moment as a linear combination of the random variables I k .</p><p>If we now assume that the intensity variations</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">∆I k = I k − E[I k ] of the patches are uncorrelated, i.e. E[∆I k ∆I k ′ ] = 0 for k k ′ , we have V[M mn ] = 4π 2 R 2m+2n+4 N 2 N k=1 V[I k ] µ 2 k (1 − µ 2 k ) m+n cos 2m ϕ k sin 2n ϕ k (A.16)</formula><p>For sufficiently large N the patches would resolve even the smallest surface structures and we would have V[I k ] = σ 2 I (µ k ) according to <ref type="bibr">(A.4)</ref>. However, in that case the intensities of adjacent patches would be correlated, so (A.16) would not hold. For the latter equation we effectively need patches that are larger than the correlation length of the surface structures. We must therefore assume that N is large enough for the discretization (A.12) to hold, and still small enough that the patches are uncorrelated. In this regime we have V[I k ] &lt; σ 2 I (µ k ), since I k is the average intensity in patch k, not the local intensity at point (µ k , ϕ k ). In fact, V[I k ] will depend on the patch size (or N) in such a way that V[I k ]/N is invariant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Ludwig 2006</ref>). (This is obviously the case for independent patches: grouping them into larger and fewer patches decreases the variance in proportion to the resulting N.) We write the invariant quantity as V <ref type="bibr">[I k</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_35">] N = A(µ k ) 2 C(µ k ) 2 (A.17)</formula><p>where A(µ) is the mean intensity as before and C(µ) the centreto-limb variation of the contrast (scaled by N −1/2 ).
