				<p>We present a search for Trojan companions to 25 transiting exoplanets. We use the technique of Ford &amp; Gaudi, in which a difference is sought between the observed transit time and the transit time that is calculated by fitting a two-body Keplerian orbit to the radial-velocity data. This technique is sensitive to the imbalance of mass at the L4/L5 points of the planet-star orbit. No companions were detected. The median 2σ upper limit is 60 M⊕, and the most constraining limit is 2.5 M⊕ for the case of GJ 436.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Trojan companions are bodies in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with a planet, librating around one of the two Lagrange points (L4 and L5) of the planet's orbit around the star. Several methods have been proposed to detect Trojan companions to exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Laughlin &amp; Chambers 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Croll et al. 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Ford &amp; Holman 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Ford &amp; Gaudi 2006</ref>. In this paper, we present a search for Trojan companions to 25 known transiting exoplanets for which suitable data are available, using the method of <ref type="bibr">Ford &amp; Gaudi (2006, hereafter, "FG")</ref>. An important virtue of this method is that a sensitive search for Trojans can be performed using only the RV and photometric data that are routinely obtained while confirming transit candidates and characterizing the planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>The basic idea of the FG method is to compare the photometrically observed transit time (tO) with the expected transit time (tC) that is calculated by fitting a two-body Keplerian orbit to the RV data, i.e. assuming no Trojan. The presence of a Trojan companion as a third body would cause a timing offset ∆t = tO − tC .</p><p>In the case of a circular orbit, if there is no Trojan companion, the force vector on the star points directly at the planet and the observed transit time tO coincides with the time tV when the orbital velocity of the star is in the plane of the sky (i.e., the time of RV null). If instead there is a single Trojan located at the L4 or L5 Lagrange point (or librating with a small amplitude), then the force vector on the star does not point directly at the planet; it is displaced in angle toward the Trojan companion. As a result, tO occurs earlier or later than tV . The magnitude of tO −tV is proportional to the Trojan mass mT , for small values of the Trojan-to-planet mass ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ford &amp; Gaudi 2006</ref>): ∆t ≃ ±37.5 min (P/3 days)(mT /10 M⊕)(0.5 MJ /(mP + mT )) (1). The positive sign corresponds to a mass excess at the L4 point (leading the planet) while the negative sign corresponds to that at the L5 point (lagging the planet). For an eccentric two-body orbit, tC does not generally coincide with tV . We calculate tC by fitting a two-body Keplerian orbit to the RV data and calculating the expected transit time based on the fitted orbital parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data Analysis</head><p>The RV data were taken from the available literature on each system. We fitted the Keplerian model to the RV data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, employing a 2 N. Madhusudhan &amp; Joshua N. Winn Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ford 2005)</ref>. In general, uniform priors were used for all parameters. A prior constraint on e cos ω was used where secondary eclipse measurements are available in literature. A single chain of ∼ 10 6 links was used for each system. For each parameter, we found the mode of the a posteriori distribution, and the 68.3% confidence interval, defined as the range that excludes 15.9% of the probability at each extreme of the distribution. We thus obtained tC from fitting the RV data. We determined tO using the most precise published photometric ephemeris, and then computed ∆t = tO − tC. The results for ∆t are translated into constraints on the Trojan mass mT using Eq. (1) for circular orbits, and using equivalent expressions for eccentric orbits obtained by numerical integrations of three-body orbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>The 95.4% (2σ) upper limits on mT and on mT /mP are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The median upper limit on mT is 60 M⊕, with the most constraining limit of 2.5 M⊕ holding for GJ 436. This powerful upper limit is possible for this case because of the small stellar and planetary masses, and the copious RV data available for this system. The median upper limit on the mass ratio mT /mP is 0.1, with a best-case value of 0.015 for HD 17156. The powerful constraint in this case is a result of the unusually long orbital period of 21 days and plentiful precise RV data. In all cases but two, the result for ∆t was consistent with zero within 2σ. The exceptions were CoRoT-Exo-2 and WASP-2, for which ∆t = 30 +17 −14 and −142 +53 −44 minutes respectively. The results for these two systems are worth following up with additional RV data. However, in a sample of 25 systems, even if ∆t is always consistent with zero, one expects approximately one 2σ outlier. There were no cases in which ∆t was inconsistent with zero at the 3σ level. Hence, we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a Trojan companion in this ensemble.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. 95.4 % upper-limits on trojans masses and on trojan-planet mass ratios.
