			<abstract>
				<p>From the 1940&apos;s to the present, space explorations, which is a highly important topic for the world and human beings, penetrate into many areas from the communication to the national security as well as from the discovery of exo-planets and new life forms to space mining. On the top of the countries which do researches on these fields are the developed countries and the developing countries are only used as launch areas, in an irrelevant manner of the research and development. However, developing countries can significantly reduce foreign dependency and security flaws as well as providing important reputation gain in international platforms by conducting space research and development activities as already done by developed countries. All the large-scale space probes conducted by developed countries oblige Turkey to develop space researches in terms of economy, security and scientific aspects. Due to these reasons, the approximate costs of a launch base, which will be installed to conduct space researches in Turkey, and of a satellite or a spacecraft, which will be able to launch from this base and serve a variety of purposes, are calculated in this study. In an effort to make the mentioned calculations, examples of various countries that have already established a launch base and already launched from these bases are analyzed and some projections are built for Turkey by calculating the estimated costs. Since these projections must be carried out by the Republic of Turkey since the private sector in Turkey will not be willing to invest in such activities, the possible public advantages can be gained through these activities are also mentioned and evaluated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Swot Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths</head><p>-Turkey is located between the latitudes of 36 and 42 degrees. It has a better latitudinal position than all other launch sites except KouRou and Cape Canaveral launch bases. -Our close latitudinal position to the equator provides an advantage in terms of quickly escaping from the gravity, carrying heavier loads and using less fuel in space missions. -Whereas the complicated orbital maneuvers are required in higher latitudes close to the poles, Turkey can obtain more effective results with less and easy orbital maneuvers due to its latitudinal location. -Based on the geo-political position, Turkey can become the only potential launch base located in the junction of three continents. -Turkey has a large number of young population that are graduated from limited number of universities with astronomy research departments and many of this population are unable to find any work in this field. -Turkey can provide employees cheaper than developed countries. -Turkey has the 18 th powerful economy in the World. -The presence of experienced Turkish astronomer such as İsmail Akbay who worked in a senior position at NASA between 1965 and 1973, and who was one of the chief engineers of Apollo projects. -The experiences of the organizations such as Havelsan, Roketsan and Aselsan on aviation and satellite technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weaknesses</head><p>-The astronomical studies are limited to academic researches and application fields are inadequate. -Turkish astronomers do not have enough engineering knowledge. -Since the sunk costs which includes the installation costs are considerably high for this industrial area, it has to be made by state. -Turkish astronomers are inexperienced in launching compared to their rivals. -There are not enough educational and motivational notions encouraged the space activities. -There is not any regulation about the conducting a domestic or foreign launch operations within country borders in Turkish legislations. -With the 77 million population, Turkey's residential areas are quite dense and there is not quite possible to find unmanned large flat areas near the sea. -Turkey is located on several fault lines which can produce intense earthquakes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunities</head><p>-The installation of a launch base eliminates the external dependence on some fields such as defense, communication and security since the land or software of other countries will not be used. -When a satellite or a similar vehicle is launched in desired time, Turkey will take intelligence and defense advantages by getting information earlier than other resources. -Since Turkey has a strong geo-political position, countries will highly prefer to use Turkey instead of other launching sites. -The construction of a launch base and attraction of foreign investors will increase the economic gain. -The development of new industries will increase employment opportunities by creating job opportunities in the country and hence this will reverse the brain drain.</p><p>-Acceleration and weight gain of the space researches will increase the quality and amount of the academic studies. -Technological breakthroughs will affect the other economic fields and this will create an overall development wave. -The presence of a launch base in Turkey will lead a power and prestige increment in foreign policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Threats</head><p>-Since the installation of a launch base in Turkey will cause reductions in both economic shares of other neighbor countries and the external dependency of Turkey, external pressures from foreign forces will highly increase. -When the return travel of launched satellites to the Earth, they may cause environmental pollution by falling within the Turkish borders. On the other hand, if they fall out of Turkish borders, the technology may be passed into the hands of other countries.</p></div>		</body>
