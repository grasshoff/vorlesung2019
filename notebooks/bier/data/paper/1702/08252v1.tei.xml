			<abstract>
				<p>Detection of a planetary ring of exoplanets remains as one of the most attractive but challenging goals in the field. We present a methodology of a systematic search for exoplanetary rings via transit photometry of long-period planets. The methodology relies on a precise integration scheme we develop to compute a transit light curve of a ringed planet. We apply the methodology to 89 long-period planet candidates from the Kepler data so as to estimate, and/or set upper limits on, the parameters of possible rings. While a majority of our samples do not have a sufficiently good signal-to-noise ratio for meaningful constraints on ring parameters, we find that six systems with a higher signal-to-noise ratio are inconsistent with the presence of a ring larger than 1.5 times the planetary radius assuming a grazing orbit and a tilted ring. Furthermore, we identify five preliminary candidate systems whose light curves exhibit ring-like features. After removing four false positives due to the contamination from nearby stars, we identify KIC 10403228 as a reasonable candidate for a ringed planet. A systematic parameter fit of its light curve with a ringed planet model indicates two possible solutions corresponding to a Saturn-like planet with a tilted ring. There also remain other two possible scenarios accounting for the data; a circumstellar disk and a hierarchical triple. Due to large uncertain factors, we cannot choose one specific model among the three.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As is the case of the Solar system, moons and planetary rings are believed to exist in exoplanetary systems as well. Their detection, however, has not yet been successful, and remains as one of the most attractive, albeit challenging, goals in exoplanetary sciences. A notable exception includes a system of giant circumplanetary rings of J1407b (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kenworthy &amp; Mamajek 2015)</ref>, but the inferred radius ∼ 1 AU implies that it is very different from Saturnian rings that we focus on in the present paper.</p><p>In addition to the obvious importance of the ring discovery itself, its detection offers an interesting method to determine the direction of the planetary spin because the ring axis is supposed to be aligned with the planetary spin as in the case of Saturn. Thus the detection of ring parameters yield a fairly complete set of dynamical architecture of transiting planetary systems; the stellar spin via asteroseismology (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huber et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benomar et al. 2014</ref>) and gravity darkening (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barnes et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Masuda 2015)</ref>, the planetary orbit via transiting photometry and the RossiterMcLaughlin effect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Queloz et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ohta et al. 2005)</ref>, and the planetary spin through the ring detection as discussed here.</p><p>The direct detection of planetary spin is very difficult, and so far only four possible signals related to planetary spins have been reported: the periodic flux variations of 2M1207b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zhou et al. 2016)</ref>, and a rotational broadening and/or distortion of the line profile of β Pictoris b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Snellen et al. 2014</ref>), HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brogi et al. 2016)</ref>, and GQ Lupi b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schwarz et al. 2016</ref>). These interesting planets are very young and have sufficiently high temperature (&gt; 1600 K) for their spin to be detected. In contrast, the same technique is not easily applicable for mature and cold planets like Saturn. Thus the detection of the ring axis provides a complementary methodology to determine the spin of more typical planets with low temperature.</p><p>Since the total mass of planetary rings is small, they do not exhibit any observable signature on the dynamics of the system. Instead, high-precision photometry and spectroscopy offer a promising approach towards their detection, and, observations of reflected light and transit are especially useful for this purpose.</p><p>Possible signatures in reflected light due to the planetary rings include the higher brightness, the characteristic phase function, distinctive spectral variations, temporary extinction of the planet, and discrepancy between reflection and thermal radiation intensities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arnold &amp; Schneider 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dyudina et al. 2005</ref>). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> attempted to explain the line broadening of the reflected light of 51 Peg b with a ringed planet model, and they conclude that it is not due to the ring. This is because their solution requires a non-coplanar configuration, which would be unlikely for short-period planets. Searches for rings through the light reflection of the host star can be made for non-transiting planets even though their signals are typically small. Therefore, while we focus on the transit photometry in the rest of this paper, the reflected-light method is indeed useful and complementary as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schneider (1999)</ref> is the first to propose the transit photometry as a tool for the ring detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al. (2001)</ref> derived the upper limit on the radius of a possible ring around HD 209458 b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnes &amp; Fortney (2004)</ref> improved the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al. (2001)</ref> by incorporating the influence of diffraction on the light curves. They claimed that the Saturn-like ring system can be detected with the photometric precision of the Kepler mission. <ref type="bibr">Ohta et al. (2009)</ref> pointed out that the combination of the transit photometry and the spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughin effect increases the detection efficiency and the credibility of the signal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zuluaga et al. (2015)</ref> proposed that an anomalously large planet radius indicated from transit photometry can be used to select candidates for ringed planets. They also proposed that the anomalous stellar density estimated from the transit may be used as a probe of a ring.</p><p>In addition to the above methodology papers, a systematic search for ring systems using real data was conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heising et al. (2015)</ref>. They analyzed 21 short-period planets (P ≤ 50 days) in the Kepler photometric data, and found no appreciable signatures of rings around the systems. This is an interesting attempt, but their null detection is not surprising because the ring tends to be unstable as the planet gets closer to the central star. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schlichting &amp; Chang (2011)</ref> demonstrated that it is hard to detect the ring at below 0.1 AU in the case of solar-like stars.</p><p>Instead, we attempt here a systematic search for rings around long-period planet candidates that exhibit single or a few transit-like signals in the Kepler photometric data. Since rings around those planets, if exist, should be dynamically stable, even a null detection would eventually put an interesting constraint on the formation efficiency and properties of icy rings for those plantetary environments.</p><p>The purposes of the paper are three-fold; to establish a methodology for the discovery of potential ringed planets, to apply the methodology to a catalog of long-period planet candidates from Kepler, and to detect and/or constrain the possible ringed planets. Section 2 presents our simple model of a ringed planet, and describes the expected transit signal. In Section 3, we explain how to select target objects for our search, and classify them into four groups according to the amplitude and nature of the signal-to-noise ratio of their light curves relative to the expected signature by possible ringed planets. In Section 4, we place upper limits on ring parameters for seven systems with a good signal-to-noise ratio. In Section 5, we select five tentative ringed-planet candidates from the high signal candidates classified in Section 3. While four out of the five are likely to be false positives, one system, KIC 10403228, passes all the selection criteria that we impose. Therefore we attempt a systematic parameter survey for the possible ring around KIC 10403228 in Section 6. Also we examine and discuss various other possibilities that may explain the observed ring-like anomaly. Final section is devoted to conclusion and future prospects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Basic parameters that characterize a ringed planet system</head><p>Our simple model of a ringed planet adopted in this paper basically follows <ref type="bibr">Ohta et al. (2009)</ref>. The ring is circular, and has a constant optical depth τ everywhere between the inner and outer radii of R in and R out . We denote the radii of the star and planet by R ⋆ and R p .</p><p>The configuration of the planet and ring during a transit is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The X-axis is approximately aligned with the projected orbit of the planet on the stellar disk, and the Z-axis is towards the observer. This completes the (X, Y, Z) coordinate frame centered at the origin of the ringed planet (left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The normal vector of the ring plane is characterized by the two angles θ and φ in a spherical coordinate (right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>We also set up another coordinate system (x, y, z) centered at the origin of the star in such a way that the major and minor axes of the projected ring are defined to be parallel with x-and y-axes, respectively, with z-axis being towards the observer.</p><p>The ring is assumed to move along the planetary orbit with constant obliquity angles (θ, φ), and the planet is assumed to move on a Keplerian orbit around the star. The left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the transit of the ringed planet, whose impact parameter is b. from the center of the planet to that of the star. The radius of the star is R ⋆ , the radius of the planet is R p and the impact parameter of the planet is b. The z-axis and the Z-axis are toward the observer. (Right) Enlarged view of the planet with the ring. R in and R out are the inner and outer radii of the ring respectively. The obliquity angle θ and azimuthal angle φ are defined with respect to (X, Y, Z)-coordinate.</p><p>We assume a thin uniform ring with a constant optical depth τ for the light from the direction normal to the ring plane. Thus the fraction of the background stellar light transmitted through the inclined ring is given by exp(−τ (sin θ cos φ) −1 ), and we define the shading parameter T as 1 − exp(−τ (sin θ cos φ) −1 ). In our simple ring model, the value of T , instead of τ , fully specifies the effective optical transparency of the ring.</p><p>In summary, our simple ring model is characterized by five parameters; four (R in , R out , θ, φ) specify the geometry of the ring, the other is a shading parameter T . Instead of R in and R out , we use dimensionless parameters in fitting,:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r in/p ≡ R in R p , r out/in ≡ R out R in .<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transit signal of a ringed planet</head><p>The stellar intensity profile I(x, y) under the assumption of the quadratic limb darkening law is expressed in terms of two parameters u 1 and u 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I(x, y) I 0 = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ) 2   µ ≡ 1 − x 2 + y 2 R 2 ⋆   ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where I 0 is the intensity at the center of the star.

Our method achieves the numerical error less than 10 −7 in relative flux, and this is much smaller than a typical noise of the Kepler photometric data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Effects that are neglected in our model</head><p>We briefly comment on three effects that we neglect in the analysis below; finite binning during exposure time, planetary precession, and forward-scattering of the ring. While all of them are negligible for the Saturnian ringed planet with a long period, they may become important in other situations.</p><p>For the precise comparison of our light-curve predictions against the Kepler long cadence, we may have to take account of the finite exposure time <ref type="bibr">(29.4 min)</ref> properly. In fact, the binning effect is shown to bias the transit parameter estimate in the case of short-period planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kipping 2010)</ref>. For long-period planets that we focus on here, however, the transit duration is sufficiently longer than the finite exposure time. Thus the binning effect is not important. In the case of the transit of Saturn in front of the Sun, for instance, the fractional difference of the relative flux is typically an order of 10 −5 between models with and without the binning effect. This value is an order-of-magnitude smaller than the expected noise in the Kepler photometric data. Thus we can safely neglect the binning effect in the present analysis.</p><p>The precession of a planetary spin would generate observable seasonal effects on the transit shape of a ringed planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carter &amp; Winn 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heising et al. 2015</ref>). Since our current target systems are extracted from those with a single transit, however, we can ignore the effect; the period of the precession is proportional to the square of the orbital period, and thus the precession effect during a transit is entirely negligible. Nevertheless, we note here that this could be an interesting probe of the dynamics of short-period ringed planetary systems that exhibit multiple transits.</p><p>In the present analysis, we consider the effect of light-blocking alone due to the ring during its transit. In reality, forward scattering (diffraction by the ring particles) may increase the flux of the background light. Let us consider light from the star to the observer through the ring particle with diameter d. First, light is emitted from the disk of the star, and arrives at the ring particles. The angular radius of the star viewed from the ring particles is about R ⋆ /a, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and R ⋆ is the stellar radius. Next, the light is diffracted by the ring particles, and the extent of the diffraction is described by the phase function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barnes &amp; Fortney 2004)</ref>; the rough diffraction angle can be estimated from the first zero of the phase function θ ≃ 0.61λ/d, where λ is wavelength of light. In particular, the effect of the diffraction becomes significant when the viewing angle R ⋆ /a is comparable to the diffraction angle. Let us define the critical particle size d crit by equating R ⋆ /a with θ = 0.61λ/d;</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">d crit = 0.61 aλ R ⋆ = 0.63 mm a/R ⋆ 2060 λ 500nm .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Barnes &amp; Fortney (2004) discussed the effect of diffraction using d crit . When d ≥ 10d crit , the diffraction angle is small, and light just behind the ring particles is diffracted to the observer. In this case, the diffraction does not affect the direction of light, and we may express the extinction due to absorption with a single parameter T .</p><p>When d ≤ d crit /10, the diffraction angle is large, and the ring particles diffract light to wider directions. Then, the amount of light that reaches the observer significantly decreases, and we may model the extinction in terms of T .</p><p>In both cases, d ≥ 10d crit and d ≤ d crit /10, the extinction can be modeled with a single parameter T . In the case of Saturn with the typical particle diameter d = 1 cm, for instance, d crit ≃ 0.63 mm from Equation (9) satisfies d &gt; 10d crit , so our model can be used to calculate the light curves of Saturn observed far from the Solar System.</p><p>We should note that when the typical size of particles satisfies d crit /10 ≤ d ≤ 10d crit , the forward scattering induces the rise in the light curve before the ingress and after the egress, and this effect can become the key to identify the signatures of the rings out of other physical signals. Incorporating the diffraction into the model, however, requires intensive computation, and this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Classification</head><p>In what follows, we present our methodology to search for planetary rings in the real data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the flow chart of the analysis procedure and its application. Methods in each step of the chart are described along with the results of analysis in the following sections.</p><p>In this section, we first choose target objects found in the Kepler field. Then, we classify them into four categories depending on the observed anomalies in the light curves. The details of classification procedure may be found in Appendices B and C.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Target Selection</head><p>The Kepler mission monitored more than 150,000 stars over four years, and identified about 8,000 planet candidates as Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). In this paper, we focus on longperiod planet candidates because icy ring particles as observed around Saturn are supposed to survive only at locations far from the host star. Considering that the temperature of the snow line is 170 K (Hayashi 1981), we choose 37 KOIs whose equilibrium temperatures are less than 200 K. In addition, we selected planet candidates reported by recent transit surveys; 41 candidates from a search by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al. (2015)</ref> and 28 candidates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Uehara et al. (2016)</ref>. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the numbers of planetary candidates in three groups are listed with the number of transits.</p><p>We exclude several systems, which are not suited for our search. For KOI-5574.01 in KOIs and KIC 2158850 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al. (2015)</ref>, we cannot find the transit signal among the noisy light curves. For KOI-959.01 in KOIs with P = 10 days and KIC 8540376 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al. (2015)</ref> with P = 31.8 days, we cannot neglect the binning effect due to the short transit duration. After removing these systems, 89 planet candidates are left in total for our search. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 summarizes  the number</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Classification of target objects</head><p>Inevitably a signature of a possible ring around a planet is very tiny. Long-period planet candidates exhibit a small number of transits <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, and the precision of the transit light curves is not improved so much by folding the multiple events. Therefore the search for a possible ring signature crucially relies on the quality of the few transiting light curves for individual systems.</p><p>According to the automated procedures described in Appendices B and C, we classify the longperiod planet candidates into the following four categories.</p><p>(A) insufficient S/N to constrain ring parameters: Since the anomalous feature due to the ring is very subtle, one cannot constrain the ring parameters at all if the intrinsic light-curve variation of the host is too large to be explained by any ring model. Thus we exclude those systems that exhibit a noisy light curve out-of-transit. The exclusion criteria ,0*T 5FR,</p></div>

For definiteness, we consider 4 different ring models <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>, and the details of the procedure are described in Appendices B and C.</p><p>(B) sufficient S/N and no significant anomaly: A fraction of the systems has a sufficiently good S/N and exhibits no significant anomaly. In such a case, we can put physically meaningful constraints on the possible ring parameters (Section 4).</p><p>(C) too large anomaly for a ringed planet: In contrast to (B), some systems exhibit a large anomaly in the transiting light curve that exceeds the prediction in the adopted ring models. Nevertheless, different ring models may be able to explain the anomaly, and we still continue to search for ringed planets in this category (Section 5).</p><p>(D) reasonable anomaly for a ringed planet Finally a small number of systems with a good S/N indeed exhibit a possible signature that could be explained by the ring model. We perform additional analysis to test the validity of the ring hypothesis in a more quantitative fashion (Section 5 and 6).</p><p>The above classification is done on the basis of observed anomalies, which are derived by fitting a planet model to light curves.

In fitting, we use only the first transit in the light curve for each candidate in deriving the observed anomaly for simplicity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Detailed pixel analysis on KIC 10403228</head><p>KIC 10403228 is considered to be an M dwarf and has a nearby star separated by about 3 arcsec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rappaport et al. 2014</ref>). According to the data taken by United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), the nearby star is located at (RA, Dec) = (19 h 24 m 54.25 s , +47 • 32 ′ 57.5 ′′ ) and its J-band flux is about 1/5 of KIC 10403228. Here we examine the possibility that the transit is associated with this nearby star rather than KIC 10403228. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows the light curve and fractional depth of the transit event in each of the pixels around KIC 10403228. The small transit depths in pixels A and B suggest that the source of the transit is not the nearby star shown by a red filled star, because otherwise the transit depths should be larger in those pixels close to the nearby star. To confirm this fact in a more quantitative way, we also calculate the centroid offset using the pixel-level light curves. As a result, we find that the flux centroid moves towards the nearby star during the transit and that the displacement is comparable to the value expected from the observed transit depth (5%) and the flux ratio in J-band (5 : 1). The variation of the transit depth and the centroid displacement consistently indicate that the transit is not due to the nearby star. While we may be able to evaluate the contamination on the light curve from this nearby star more quantitatively, it does not change our conclusion in any case, and we do not perform the detailed analysis for simplicity.</p><p>We note that the transit signal contains a clear short-period modulation (panel B in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref>). Since the modulation is not visible at panel C, it is most likely due to the nearby star. Actually, there is another long-period modulation with P ≃ 35 days in the light curve, which may come from the target star. If these periods are related to the stellar spins, the nearby star is a fast rotating star, and the target star is a slow rotator. Thus, we may ignore the effect of gravity darkening of the target star.</p></div>

We also discuss other possibilities than the above three models. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Interpretation with a ringed planet</head><p>We fit various models with and without the ring to the light curve of KIC 10403228 by minimizing the value of χ 2 defined in Equation (B4). In practice, we use ±3.09 days-time window to trim 300 data points centered around T 0 = 744.773 day (BKJD [= BJD−2454833 day]). To remove the long-term flux variations in the light curve, we adopt the model in Equation (B5) that is composed of a fourth-order polynomial and the transit model F (t) in Equation (7). The standard deviation σ is estimated to be 9.17 × 10 −4 from the out-of-transit data. This value is about 1.3 times larger than the error recorded in the SAP data.</p><p>As the transit of KIC 10403228 is observed just once, we cannot infer the orbital period from the timing of the transit. However, we can infer it from Kepler's law. The depth and V-shape of the observed transit imply that the transiting object is relatively large and grazing. Thus, we approximate the total transit duration T tra as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">T tra ≃ P 2R ⋆ 2πa √ 1 − e 2 1 + e sin ω ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the last factor is a correction term due to an eccentricity e with ω being the argument of periapse.

(2015)</ref>. The stellar density in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al.

Assuming that all the stars host planets with P ≃ 450 years, the expected number of transit detections is given by n tra = 0.045 N target 150, 000 t obs,dur /P 4 years/450 years</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">R ⋆ /a 1/25, 000 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where a/R ⋆ = 25000 is the fiducial value estimated from equation (10), t obs,dur is a observational period, and N target is the number of target stars. The adopted values of t obs,dur and N target are the typical values of Kepler. The frequency of planets with P = 450 yrs would be less than 1, so we may see n tra as the optimistic upper limit of the expected value. This current value of n tra = 0.045 is small, but not too unlikely. Apart from the tiny ring-like feature, the overall shape of the signal is clearly due to the transiting event, and it is very difficult to explain the feature from the stellar activities.</p><p>We would like to comment on the reliability of P ≃ 450 years. The key parameters are ρ ⋆ and the eccentricity in Eq (11). For example, if the system is a giant star rather than an M dwarf, the density and the period become smaller. In this sense, to specify the correct stellar density, we would need a follow-up observation. Moreover, the eccentricity can also change the estimated period in <ref type="bibr">Eq (11)</ref>. If e = 0.6, the period can be changed by the factor of (1/8.0)-8.0, and if e = 0.9, the factor of change is within (1/82.82)-82.82 (or 5 years &lt; P &lt; 34,000 years). Thus, the planet with a relatively short period and a large eccentricity can also explain the data. Although the period is uncertain, the different period does not change the fitting results, so we adopt P = 450 years for the fiducial value for the time being.</p><p>For fitting, we adopt P = 450 years, and q 1 and q 2 from the official catalog of Kepler. In summary, there are nine free parameters, t 0 , R p /R ⋆ , b, a/R ⋆ , and c i (i =0-4) for the model without the ring, and five additional parameters θ, φ, r in/p , r out/in and T for the model with ring. We set the initial values of c i (i =0-4) to those obtained from a polynomial curve fitting for the out-of-transit data.</p><p>First, we fit the planet alone model to the data. The blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> is the best-fit model without the ring. The best-fit parameters are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The residuals from the fit clearly have some systematic features, and the planet alone model fails to fully explain the light curve, in particular, around 745.8 day (BKJD) in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Therefore, we attempt to interpret the data with the ringed planet model. After trying a lot of initial values for fitting, we finally find two solutions, which give at least local minima of χ 2 in Equation (B4). <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows those two solutions in the red and green lines. The best-fit parameters are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The geometrical configurations for both solutions are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. Clearly, models with the ring significantly improve the fit.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>, values of R p , R in , and R out are calculated on the assumption of R ⋆ = 0.33 ± 0.05 R ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al. 2015</ref>). It turns out that the resulting ratio of ring and planet radii is similar to that of Saturn: R in ≃ 1.5R p and R out ≃ 2.0R p .   0.000158 ± 0.000013 0.000053 ± 0.000015 0.000038 ± 0.000015 c 4 −0.000072 ± 0.000011 0.000021 ± 0.000014 0.000005 ± 0.000012 We comment on the implication of the fitted model for KIC 10403228 in the following.

The stellar effective temperature T ⋆ = 3386 K of KIC 10403228 is taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al. (2015)</ref>. Since the equilibrium temperature expected from the model is much lower than the temperature 170 K at the snow line <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hayashi 1981)</ref>, icy particles around the planet can survive against the radiation of the host star.</p><p>The best-fit values of θ = 59.4 • for solution 1 implies a significantly tilted ring with respect to the orbital plane, and θ = 12.3 • for solution 2 implies a slightly tilted ring. We examine the stability of those tilted rings on the basis of a simple tidal theory. Under the assumption that the ring axis is aligned with the planetary spin, the damping timescale of the ring axis is equal to that for the orbital and equatorial planes of the planet to be coplanar. This time-scale is given by a tidal theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Santos et al. 2015</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">τ tidal = P orb Q 9πk 2 ρ p ρ s a R ⋆ 3 ≃ GP 3 orb Q 27π 2 k 2 ρ p = 6.94 × 10 16 yr P orb 450 years 3 2.3 × 10 −4 k 2 /Q ρ p 0.70 g cm −3 ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where P orb is an orbital period, Q is a dissipation factor, and k 2 is the second Love number. If we adopt k 2 /Q = 2.3 × 10 −4 (Lainey et al. 2012) and ρ p = 0.70 gcm −3 (Cox 2000) of Saturn, the damping timescale is sufficiently long. Thus, the best-fit configurations are consistent with the spin damping theory even under the assumption that the equatorial plane of the planet is coplanar with the ring plane. Thus, the tilted rings of our best-fits also imply the non-vanishing obliquity of the planet.</p><p>The ringed planet model is consistent with the data. However, the V-shape of the transit ( <ref type="figure">Figure  9</ref>) is also a typical feature of eclipsing binaries, and the estimated period ∼ 450 yrs may be too long to be detected in four years of Kepler's observation (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref>). Therefore, we discuss other scenarios without a planetary ring. For this purpose, in the following, we present two possible hypotheses, which can also explain the data; a binary with a circumstellar disk and a hierarchical triple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Interpretation with a circumstellar disk</head><p>In this section, we pursue the possibility that the current transit is caused by an eclipsing-binary with a circumstellar disk rather than a planetary ring. Actually, the fitting result in the previous section is also applicable to this binary scenario, so we may compare the plausibilities of the eclipsing-binary and planet scenarios to test the circumstellar disk model. For this specific purpose, we use the public code VESPA (Validation of Exoplanet Signals using a Probabilistic Algorithm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morton 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">(Morton , 2015</ref>. With VESPA, we compare the likelihoods of the following four scenarios; "HEBs (Hierarchical Eclipsing Binaries)", "EBs (Eclipsing Binaries)", "BEBs (Background Eclipsing Binaries)", and "Planets" (Transiting Planets) adopting a variety of different periods.</p><p>We adopt JHK-magnitudes from 2MASS (J-mag = 13.429 ± 0.028, H-mag = 12.793 ± 0.03, and K-mag = 12.518 ± 0.027), (RA, Dec) = (19 h 24 m 54.413 s , +47 • 32 ′ 57.5 ′′ ), maxrad = 3.0 arcsec (angular radius of the simulated region), Kepmag = 16.064, and R p /R ⋆ = 0.3. In reality, those observed colors might be contaminated by the nearby star discussed in Section 5.3, but we assume that the contamination is sufficiently small in the present analysis. Given these inputs, VESPA calculates the star populations and the probability distribution of transit shape parameters for the above four scenarios. For our adopted set of input parameters, VESPA identifies the primary star as an M dwarf consistent with the classification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2013)</ref>. We repeat the simulation ten times with different initial random numbers according to the prescription of VESPA.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the relative probability of each scenario for different assumed periods. We define the relative probability as the product of the "prior" and "likelihood" computed by VESPA, multiplied by 1000 days/P . The last factor 1000 days/P corrects for the probability that a longperiod transit is observed in a given observing duration much shorter than the orbital period, which is not taken into account in the "prior" of VESPA. The plot shows the medians and the standard deviations of the probabilities computed from 10 sets of simulations. While the binary scenarios are more likely than the Planets scenario for the shortest and the longest periods investigated here, the Planets scenario is the most preferred in the intermediate region (10 years P 100 years). The result suggests that the planetary interpretation of the light curve is not so unlikely compared to the binary scenario, although there is a fair amount of probability that this is a false positive.</p><p>Another important implication of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> is that the likelihood of orbital periods in the Planets scenario is much broader than what we intuitively thought before, and not sharply peaked around 450 years.</p><p>While <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> represents our final result from VESPA, we point out two additional factors that may be of importance for more detailed arguments.</p><p>First, the period distribution and the overall fraction of long-period planets and binaries have not been taken into account. Occurrence rate of giant planets around M dwarfs is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Clanton &amp; Gaudi (2016)</ref>. They estimated the frequency of the planets with 10 2 M ⊕ &lt; M p &lt; 10 3 M ⊕ to be 0.039 +0.042 −0.025 for 10 3 days &lt; P &lt; 10 4 days and 0.013 +0.025 −0.010 for 10 4 days &lt; P &lt; 10 5 days. On the other hand, Janson et al. (2012) estimated the multiplicity distribution of the binaries in 3-227 AU and found the overall occurrence rate 0.27 ± 0.03 peaked around 10 AU. These results imply that planets around M dwarfs is rarer than its stellar companion by one or two orders of magnitude. This difference in the overall frequency may further increase the relative plausibility of the EBs scenario compared to the Planets scenario.</p><p>Second, what also matters in reality is the frequency of planetary rings and circumstellar disks that produce the observed anomaly in addition to the transit signal. It is, however, far beyond our current knowledge to estimate these factors rigorously.</p><p>Given these difficulties, follow-up spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging would be more feasible to distinguish the EBs and Planets scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Interpretation with a hierarchical triple</head><p>An eclipse due to a close binary (rather than a single star/planet) on a wide orbit around the primary M star is yet another possibility to explain the asymmetric and long transit-like signal observed for KIC 10403228. This is because the orbital motion of the occulting binary can produce the acceleration that modifies the in-eclipse velocity of the occulting object(s) relative to the primary. To test this possibility, we consider a hierarchical triple system consisting of a short-period binary ("inner" binary) orbiting around and eclipsing the primary M star on a wide orbit ("outer" binary). In the following, we only take into account the luminosity of the occulted star and ignore the flux from the smaller binary. We also assume the orbits of both inner and outer binaries are Keplerian, and use the subscripts "in" and "out" to denote their parameters. A mass ratio of the inner binary is fixed to 1 for simplicity. In this model, the motion of the two components of the inner binary is specified by t 0,in (inferior conjunction of the inner binary), P in , a out /a in , i in , Ω in (longitude of ascending node relative to that of the outer binary), in addition to the parameters for a single-planet model (now with the subscripts "out"). We fit all of these parameters except that the stellar density ρ ⋆ = 13.0gcm −3 , q 1 = 0.6737, q 2 = 0.767, the time offset T 0 = 744.773 days in Eq (B5), and the same baseline as obtained in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> (solution 2) are fixed. The mass ratio of the outer binary is related to P in , P out , and a out /a in as</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">q ≡ M in M out = 1 (a out /a in ) 3 (P in /P out ) 2 − 1 ,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where M in is a total mass of the inner binary, and M out is the mass of the primary star. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows one of the best-fitting models with P out = 1396.615 days, a out /a in = 54.53, Ω in = −0.00945, P out = 10.96 days, b out = 2.024, cos i 2 = 0.103, t 0,out = 1.965 × 10 −3 days, and t 0,in = 1.965 × 10 −5 days. In this solution, we find q = 0.0956, which leads to M in = 30M J . We also obtain χ 2 /dof = 379.3/292, which is comparable to the ringed-planet model. In this solution, the observed ∼ 2 days duration is reproduced despite that the value of P out is much shorter than required for the planetary scenario. This is made possible because the orbital motion of the inner binary cancels out the high orbital velocity of the outer binary. In addition to this particular solution, we find various other solutions with similar χ 2 values for a wide range of P out . In general, the solutions with longer P out are found to correspond to smaller q; for example, we find q ≃ 0.02 for P out ≃ 30 yrs, and q ≃ 0.003 for P out = 300 yrs. For M ⋆ = 0.3M ⊙ , these mass ratios q = (0.1, 0.02, 0.003) translate into M in = (30M J , 6M J , M J ). Thus, in this scenario, the system can be composed of three low-mass stars or a star with a binary planet. The advantage of this scenario is that the observed long transit can be reproduced with much smaller P out than in the ringed-planet model, which leads to far higher transit/eclipse probability. On the other hand, it is also true that the parameters need to be finely tuned to cancel the two orbital motions. While the degree of required fine tuning is crucial in comparing the evidence of this hypothesis with the planetary or stellar ring models, the evaluation of this factor is not trivial given the large parameter space. In addition, there still remain uncertainties in frequency of the hypothetical hierarchical triple (three low-mass stars or a star with a binary planet). Given these complexities, it is difficult to conclude whether or not this scenario is favored compared to the above two. Again, the follow-up observation will be effective for the further study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.1.">Oblate planet</head><p>A significant oblateness of a single planet may mimic a ring-like anomaly during a transit. Indeed our model reduces to an oblate planet if we set R p = 0, R in = 0, and T = 1.0 with an appropriate choice of θ and φ. We attempt the fit of this oblate planet model to the light curve, and obtain the best-fit with χ 2 /dof = 492.4/288. This value is much larger than the best-fit value χ 2 /dof = 349.1/286 with the model with a ring. Furthermore, the best-fit oblate planet model requires the projected ellipticity of f = (a − b)/a = 0.79, where a is the major axis, and b is the minor axis. This solution is an unstable configuration; the rotating object will break up due to the centrifugal force when a ≥ 1.5b (Equation <ref type="bibr">(2.14)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Maeder (2009)</ref>). Thus, we conclude that the oblateness of the planet is unlikely to explain the observed anomaly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.2.">Additional transit due to exomoon</head><p>In Section 6.3, we only consider an additional motion of an occulting object due to an accompanying object. However, a transit of the accompanying object (e.g. exomoon) itself is yet another possibility for the peculiar light curve of KIC 10043228. As shown below, this possibility is ruled out by the shape of the anomaly.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the anomaly in the light curve is significant only in the latter half. Motivated by this fact, we fit the light curve using the planet-alone model, masking the latter half of the transit and adopting the same baseline as obtained in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> (solution 2); the difference between this model and the observed light curve would represent the anomalous contributions from anything other than the main transiting planet. The result in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> clearly shows that the anomaly consists of a short rise in the flux followed by a more significant dip. Such a feature is clearly inconsistent with the transit of an exomoon.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The anomaly consists of a rise followed by a dip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.3.">Anomalies specific to in-transit data</head><p>There exist anomalies specific to in-transit data; spot crossing and gravity darkening. If the planet crosses spots on the stellar surface, the light curve is deformed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2011</ref>). In general, however, spots are dark, so spot-crossing causes a bump in the light curve. The observed anomaly in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> is inconsistent with a single bump, so the spot is unlikely to cause the anomaly. Gravity darkening makes the light curve asymmetric (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barnes et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Masuda 2015)</ref>. In section 5.3, we identify the target star as the slow-rotating star, and the gravity darkening is negligible. In conclusion, these mechanisms are unlikely to explain the ring-like signal in the light curve.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.4.">Stellar noise</head><p>The ring-like structure in the light curve shows up only for a short duration. Thus, the shortterm stellar noise might mimic the ring-like anomaly just by chance. To discuss this possibility, we investigate the statistical property of the stellar activity of KIC 10403228. Specifically, we consider how frequently one encounters stellar noises comparable to the anomalous in-transit residuals. As will be shown, we find it difficult to reproduce the feature with stellar activities of KIC 10403228. In principle we could check to see if the similar feature arises in stars other than KIC 10403228 more generally, but it is a separate question and does not answer if the signal for the particular star is due to that stellar activity. Therefore we analyze the light curve of KIC 10403228 alone in this section.</p><p>To focus on the short-term noises, we remove the long-term variations by dividing the light curves into short segments and fitting each of them with polynomials. The more specific procedure is as follows. We exclude in-transit data as well as data around gaps in the light curve. From the remaining data, we pick up a segment of 6.18-day long light curve centered around a randomly chosen time and fit it with a quartic polynomial to remove the variation within the segment. In principle, one could use different functions (e.g. a spline function) or different time-window for detrending, but in any case the final results are insensitive to these choices. For consistency, we adopt the same baseline and time-window as those used in Section 6.1.</p><p>We iterate "picking up a segment" and "detrending" procedures 1000 times and obtain 1000 segments of detrended light curves, whose centers are randomly distributed over the whole observing duration. We note that the total number of points in the detrended segments is 1000 × 300 = 3.0 × 10 5 , which is sufficiently large to sample all the original data points (N = 10, 000). By averaging the 1000 detrended light curves at each time, we obtain one light curve. This averaging operation suppresses the dependence on the choice of the central time of each segment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows the resulting detrended light curve (bottom) along with the light curve before detrending (top  Now we move on to the comparison of the statistical property of stellar activities and the residuals of fit in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Let us define F data (t) as the flux ratio of the detrended light curve with respect to the mean. To investigate the short-term correlation of stellar activities, we divide the light curves into continuously brightening events (F data (t) &gt; 1) and fading events (F data (t) &lt; 1). Then, we compute the duration and amplitude (average of the deviation from the mean |F data (t) − 1|) for each event. For comparison, we also calculate the duration and average relative flux for events in residuals in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. The left panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> is the scatter plot of the duration and average relative flux of events for three groups;</p><p>(a) all events out of the transit (the black data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref>.</p><p>(b) residuals of the ringed-planet fit (the red line in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).</p><p>(c) residuals of the single-planet fit (the blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).</p><p>The right panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows the distributions of durations for the three groups. In each duration bin, the vertical axis shows the total number of points in all events with that duration. The distribution of (a) is normalized to give the same total number of events as (b) and (c). The quoted error-bars are simply computed from Poisson statistics of the number of each event. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  15</ref> shows that the distribution (b) is closer to (a) than (c). Thus, the ringed planet model is better than the planet model in terms of property of the correlated noise.</p><p>So far, we have shown that the ring-like anomaly cannot be explained statistically. We further consider whether the stellar noise can mimic the light-curve shape itself. We examine this hypothesis by focusing on the most significant fading event in the out-of-transit data; see the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  15</ref>. The light curve of this event is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>. We would like to see if the combination of the planet model and this event can reproduce the ringed-planet like feature. To do this, we appropriately embed the transit of the planet into the light curve around the fading event. Here, the parameters of the planet are the same as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. Then we fit the two models with and without a ring to those data, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16 (b)</ref>. As a result, we find the difference in χ 2 of the two models to be 157.9, which is smaller than 434.9 obtained in Section 6.1 for solution 2. Thus, we conclude that it is difficult to reproduce the ring candidate by combining the stellar activities and the transit of the planet. Duration and average amplitude of continuously brighting (F (t) &gt; 1) and fading (F (t) &lt; 1) events are plotted. The black points are plotted from the stellar activities in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, and red points and blue points are plotted from the residuals of a ringed planet and a single planet model fitting in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> respectively.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.5.">Combination of the above mechanisms</head><p>In principle, a combination of the mechanisms discussed above could be invoked to reproduce the observed anomaly. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, for example, the bump and dip in the residual might be explained separately by a spot crossing and an exomoon. However, such a probability is a priori very low, and so we do not discuss those possibilities any further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and Future prospects</head><p>In this paper, we present a methodology to detect exoplanetary rings and apply it to the 89 long-period transiting planet candidates in the Kepler sample for the first time. After fitting a single planet model to light curves of target objects, we classify them into four groups depending on the observed anomalies and model predictions. Assuming grazing geometry and a titled ring, we obtain upper limits on R out /R p for 12 planet candidates, and find R out /R p &lt; 1.5 for six of them. While we select five preliminary ringed planet candidates using the results of classification, four of them turn out to be false positives, but KIC 10403228 still remains as a possible ringed-planet system.</p><p>We fit our ringed planet model to the light curve of KIC 10403228, and we obtain two consistent solutions with the tilted ring. However, the V-shape of the current transit is a typical feature of an eclipsing binary, and the estimated orbital period P =450 years on the assumption of a circular orbit may be too long for the transit to be detected. Therefore, we also consider other two possibilities accounting for the data. One model assumes that the transit is caused by an eclipsing binary, and the ring-like feature is caused by a circumstellar disk rather than a planetary ring. For comparison, using the public code VESPA, we calculate the plausibility of this scenario and the planet scenario, and find that we cannot exclude both possibilities at the current stage. The other model we consider assumes the observed eclipse is caused by two objects orbiting around each other (hierarchical triple configuration), where the orbital motion of the smaller binary produces the long and asymmetric eclipse as observed for KIC 10403228. Assuming this model, we find various solutions for a wide range of orbital periods down to P ≃ 1400 days, although it requires more or less fine-tuned configurations. In addition to the above scenarios, we also discuss other possibilities, and find that none of them are likely to explain the data. In conclusion, there remain the three leading scenarios accounting for the data: "planetary ring scenario," "circumstellar disk scenario," and "hierarchical triple scenario." A follow-up observation would play an important role in the further study.</p><p>The current research can be improved in several different ways. We can enlarge the sample of target objects towards those with shorter orbital periods. The interpretation of KIC 10403228 is fundamentally limited by the fact that it exhibits the only one transit. Obviously the credibility significantly increases if a system exhibits a robust ring-like anomaly repeatedly in the transits at different epochs. Moreover, difference in transit shapes at different epochs would enable us to discriminate between "disk scenario" and "hierarchical triple scenario." In addition, our current methodology puts equal weights on the data points over the entire transit duration. Since the signature of a ring is particularly strong around the ingress and egress, more useful information on R out /R p would be obtained with more focused analysis of the features around those epochs. We plan to improve our methodology, and attempt to apply it to a broader sample of transiting planets in due course. We do hope that we will be able to affirmatively answer a fundamental question "Are planetary rings common in the Galaxy?".</p></div>

The center of the ring system is (x p , y p ). The intersections of two circles are easily computed and the number of the intersection points is two at most.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Precision and computational time</head><p>To test the precision and the computational time in our scheme, we simulate a transit of a Saturnlike planet with R p /R ⋆ = 0.083667, R in/p = 1.5, R out/p = 2.0, θ = π/3, φ = π/3, T = 1.0. We take P = 10759.3 days, a/R ⋆ = 2049.89, b = 0.5, q 1 = 0.49, and q 2 = 0.34 for orbital parameters and stellar parameters. For comparison, we prepare another integration scheme, which adopts pixel-by-pixel integration around the planetary center (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Ohta et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>First, we check the precision of the integration of our proposed method by comparing the precision of the pixel-by-pixel integration methods with 5000 × 5000 pixels. As a result, two methods are in agreement to the extent of 10 −7 . Thus, our proposed method achieves the numerical error less than 10 −7 , which is much smaller than the typical noise in the Kepler data 10 −4 .</p><p>Second, we check the computational time of our template. Our proposed method typically takes 3.0 ms for calculating one point and 200 s in fitting in Section 6.1. For comparison, we also check the computational time of the planetary transit using PyTransit package (Parviainen 2015), and we find that it takes 0.3 ms to compute all the 300 data points and 0.3 s in fitting in Section 6.1.</p><p>Finally, we compare our method with the pixel-by-pixel integration. If we set the pixel sizes to satisfy the same computational time as that of our method, the precision of the integration becomes 10 −5 in the fiducial configurations. This precision depends on the specific configuration; it becomes 10 −4 for if we adopt "R p = 0.17 and b = 0.8" and 3 × 10 −6 for "R p = 0.042 and b = 0.3". In summary, when we need a high-precision model, one should use our proposed method, and, if not, one may use the pixel-by-pixel integration to save the amount of calculation.</p><p>Incidentally, in a practical case of fitting with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, our method is useful in a sense that gives the smooth value of χ 2 . This is because the smoothness is needed to calculate the differential values for χ 2 in LM method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Method of target classification in Section 3 B.1. Concept</head><p>As we demonstrated in the main text, signatures of a ringed planet can be detected by searching for any deviation from the model light curve assuming a ringless planet. The deviation is, however, often very tiny and comparable to the noise level, and so careful quantitative arguments are required to discuss the presence or absence of the ring in a given light curve. In the following, we present a procedure to evaluate the detectability of a ring based on the comparison between the residual from the "planet-alone" model fit and the noise level in the light curve.</p><p>Let us denote one light curve including a transit by I i (i = 0, 1, · · · , N data ), where N data is the number of data points. We also define δ i as the residual of fitting I i with the planet-alone model. As a quantitative measure of this residual signal δ i relative to the noise level, we introduce the following signal-to-noise ratio:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">S/N = i δ 2 i σ 2 = i δ 2 i N data N data σ 2 = ∆ 2 1 (σ/ √ N data ) 2 ∆ 2 ≡ i δ 2 i N data .<label>(B1)</label></formula><p>In the last equality, we further define ∆ 2 as the variance of the residual time series, and σ is evaluated as the standard deviation of the out-of-transit light curve. We use the subscript "obs" to specify the above quantities obtained by fitting the planet-alone model to the real observed data: δ i, obs , S/N obs , and ∆ 2 obs .</p><p>On the other hand, we can also compute the corresponding values of δ i , S/N , and ∆, by fitting the simulated light curve of a ringed planet with the planet-alone model. We denote these values as δ 2 i, sim (p), S/N sim (p), and ∆ 2 sim (p), where p represents the set of parameters of the ringed-planet model. If these values are sufficiently large compared to the noise variance (see ∆ 2 thr below), the signal of the ringed planet is distinguishable from the noise. In addition, comparing these theoretically expected residual levels with observed ones, we can relate the observed residuals to the parameters of the ringed model, even in the absence of clear anomalies.</p><p>To simplify the following arguments, we mainly use ∆ 2 instead of S/N to evaluate the significance of the anomaly (see also Section B.3 for detailed reason). Practically, conversion from one to the other is rather simple, as the conversion factor σ/ √ N data is well determined from the observed data alone; given a transit light curve, the transit duration T dur and the bin size t bin give the number of data points N data = T dur /t bin , and the standard deviation σ can also be inferred from the out-of-transit flux.</p><p>For a given region of parameter space p, ∆ 2 sim (p) has the maximum value ∆ 2 max, sim . If ∆ 2 max, sim is smaller than some threshold value ∆ 2 thr determined by the noise level in the light curve, the ringedplanets with the corresponding value of p, even if they exist, cannot be detected in the system. Then, the comparison of ∆ 2 obs , ∆ 2 max, sim , and ∆ 2 thr allows for classification into four categories schematically illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">(A) : ∆ 2 max, sim &lt; ∆ 2 thr</formula><p>The expected signal from the ring is so small compared to the noise level that we cannot discuss its detectability.</p><p>(B) : ∆ 2 obs &lt; ∆ 2 thr &lt; ∆ 2 max, sim</p><p>Although the rings with ∆ 2 thr &lt; ∆ 2 sim (p) could have been detected, no significant anomaly is observed (∆ obs &lt; ∆ thr ) in reality. Thus, the parameter region that gives ∆ 2 thr &lt; ∆ 2 sim (p) is excluded.</p><p>(C) : ∆ 2 thr &lt; ∆ 2 max, sim &lt; ∆ 2 obs A significant anomaly is detected, but its amplitude is too large to be explained by the ringed-planet model with the given range of p. The value of ∆ 2 thr is arbitrary. In this paper, we choose ∆ 2 thr so that it corresponds to S/N = 10 in Equation (B1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">∆ 2 thr = 10 σ 2 N data ,<label>(B2)</label></formula><p>where σ and N data are calculated from the observed data. The methods to calculate the other variances, ∆ 2 obs , ∆ 2 sim (p), and ∆ 2 max, sim will be presented in the following subections.</p><p>Before proceeding further, let us consider the orbital period dependence of N data = T dur /t bin in Equation (B1). From Kepler's third law, T dur ∝ P (R ⋆ /a) ∝ P 1/3 . For the short-period planets, t bin ∝ P because the number of folded transits is proportional to 1/P . Thus, the number of the data T dur /t bin is proportional to P −2/3 . This means that the detectability of rings (S/N ) is higher for the shorter-period planets for a given value of ∆ 2 . This explains the strong constraints on the ring parameters obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heising et al. (2015)</ref> for hot Jupiters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.2.1. Definition</head><p>The residual δ i, obs is obtained by fitting the planet-alone model to the data. If the ring does not exist, the value of S/N obs in Equation (B1), which is formally equivalent to the chi-squared, is expected to be close to the degree of freedom DOF obs . In contrary, if the ring does not exist, S/N sim (p) is equal to zero. This mean that S/N obs − S/N sim (p) ≃ DOF obs in the limit of the non-ring system. Thus, for comparison of ∆ 2 sim (p) and ∆ 2 obs , the value of (S/N − DOF obs ) serves as a good estimator of the observed anomaly rather than S/N . We thus slightly modify Equation (B1) to define ∆ 2 obs so that it corresponds to (S/N − DOF obs ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">∆ 2 obs = χ 2 − DOF obs 1 (σ/ √ N data ) 2 ,<label>(B3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">χ 2 = i δ i, obs σ 2 .

The adopted model M (t) is composed of a fourth-order polynomial and a transit model F (t):</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">M (t) = F (t)[c 0 + c 1 (t − T 0 ) + c 2 (t − T 0 ) 2 + c 3 (t − T 0 ) 3 + c 4 (t − T 0 ) 4 ],<label>(B5)</label></formula><p>where c i are coefficients of polynomials, and T 0 is a time offset. The polynomials are used to remove the long-term flux variations in the light curve. The transit model F (t) is implemented by the PyTransit package (Parviainen 2015). PyTransit generates the light curves based on the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> with the quadratic limb darkening law.</p><p>The above model M (t) includes 12 parameters, t 0 , R p /R ⋆ , b, a/R ⋆ , P, q 1 , q 2 , and c i (i = 0 ∼ 4). For KOIs, the initial values of a/R ⋆ , R p /R ⋆ , and b for fitting are taken from the KOI catalog.</p><p>The initial values of the limb darkening parameters are taken from the Kepler Input Catalog. For a single transit event, where we cannot estimate the orbital period from the transit interval, we choose P , instead of a/R ⋆ , as a fitting parameter and estimate a/R ⋆ from P using Kepler's third law and the mean stellar density given in the catalog.</p><p>In fitting, we remove outliers iteratively to correctly evaluate χ 2 . We first fit all the data with the model M (t), and flag the points that deviate more than 5σ from the best model. We then refit only the non-flagged data using the same model, and update the flags of all the original data points, including the ones classified as outliers before, on the basis of the new best model and the same 5σ criterion. We iterate this procedure until the flagged data are converged. While this process gives a more robust evaluation of χ 2 , it may also erase the signature of the ringed planet; thus we visually check all the light curves in any case not to miss the real ringed planets.</p><p>The noise variance σ 2 is estimated for each transit light curve by fitting the out-of-transit light curve with a fourth-order polynomial, and calculating the variance of the residuals. Flare-like events are excluded from the estimation of the noise variance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3. Calculation of ∆ 2 sim (p) and ∆ 2 sim,max</head><p>Since the parameter space p for a ringed planet is very vast, we wish to reduce the volume we need to search with simulations as much as possible. First we show that ∆ 2 sim (p) does not depend on P and a/R ⋆ with other parameters fixed including limb darkening parameters q 1 , q 2 , the transit impact parameter b, planet-to-star radius ratio R p /R ⋆ , inner and outer ring radii relative to the planetary radius r in/p and r out/p , , the direction of the ring (θ, φ), and a shading parameter T . This property becomes apparent by rewriting ∆ 2 sim (p) into the following integral form approximately, assuming that the sampling rate (t bin ) is sufficiently small compared to the duration T dur :</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">∆ 2 sim (p) ≃ T dur /2 −T dur /2 δ 2 sim (t, p)dt T dur /2 −T dur /2 dt = 1/2 −1/2 δ 2 sim (T dur t ′ , p)dt ′ 1/2 −1/2 dt ′ = 1/2 −1/2 ¯ δ 2 sim (t ′ , p)dt ′ ,<label>(B6)</label></formula><p>where ¯ δ sim (t, p) ≡ δ sim (T dur t, p)</p><p>and the origin of time is shifted to the transit center. Assuming that the values of q 1 , q 2 , b, R p /R ⋆ , r out/p , r in/p , θ, φ, and T are fixed, ¯ δ(t, p) defined above does not depend on T dur explicitly. Therefore, ∆ 2 sim (p) given by Equation (B6) does not depend on the time scale of the transit T dur , which is determined by P and a/R ⋆ , and we do not need to simulate the dependence of ∆ 2 sim (p) on these two parmeters.</p><p>To constrain the parameter space further, we use the observed transit depth. Here we also assume that the values of q 1 , q 2 , b, T , r in/p , and the ring direction are fixed and that R p /R ⋆ and r out/p are the only free parameters. Then, the constraint on the observed transit depth leaves only one degree of freedom, specified by contours in the R p /R ⋆ -r out/p plane; henceforth we rewrite ∆ 2 sim (p) as ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) to explicitly show this dependence.</p><p>To compute the relation ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) for a given transit depth, we first calculate the value of ∆ 2 sim and the transit depths for a sufficient number of points in the (r out/p , R p /R ⋆ ) plane. The necessary number of points depends on the fiducial model, and, in our simulation, we prepare about two hundred points for each model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. For any r out/p , the observed transit depth uniquely translates into R p /R ⋆ by the interpolation in the R p /R ⋆ -transit depth plane, because the transit depth is a monotonically increasing function of the R p /R ⋆ . Thus, the given value of r out/p is uniquely related to ∆ 2 sim given the transit depth. By repeating this procedure for many different values of r out/p , we can compute the relation ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ). We note that once a sufficient number of interpolated lines are prepared, one transit depth determines the relation ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) without additional calculation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref> shows ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) curves created in this way, for 4 × 4 = 16 different sets of impact parameters, ring directions, and transit depths. The four sets of p adopted here (model I ∼ model IV) are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, and four transit depths are chosen to be 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05. We fix T = 1 and r in/p = 1 in all of these simulations.</p><p>Here we simulate ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) only for 1 ≤ r out/p ≤ r eq , where r eq is the value of r out/p for which the minor axis of the sky-projected outer ring is equal to the planetary radius, computed for each model. This is because the value of ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) shows no R p /R ⋆ dependence beyond r eq , when T = 1 and r in/p = 1 are adopted; if this is the case, the planetary disk is within the outer disk and the transit depth is solely determined by the latter.</p><p>In this paper, we only use the observed constraint on the transit depth. However, this is just for simplicity and we can certainly take into account the constraints on other parameters including b, q 1 , and q 2 from the morphology of the observed transit light curve (e.g. egress and ingress durations). Such constraints further restrict the ring models that could be consistent with the observed light curve and thus help more elaborate discussions on the ring parameters, which we leave to future works.</p><p>C. Derivation of the upper limit of r out/p : case of KOI-1466.01</p><p>If a system is classified into group (B), the ring models with ∆ 2 thr &lt; ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ) are excluded. The upper limits of r out/p thus obtained are summarized in Sections 4 and 5. Here we describe how the limit is derived using the relation ∆ 2 sim (r out/p ), taking KOI-1466.01 for example.</p><p>The black and red lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref> are theoretically expected signals from the ringed planets (i.e., ∆ 2 sim (r out/p )) for model I ∼ model IV and for the transit depth of 0.0202 inferred from the observed data. The green line shows the threshold value of ∆ 2 thr that satisfies S/N = 10, and the blue line shows the observed residual level ∆ 2 obs obtained by fitting the planet-alone model to the data. Here ∆ 2 obs &lt; ∆ 2 thr , which means that no significant deviation from the planet-alone model is detected. In this case, we can in turn exclude the models above the green line, because any anomaly above this level should have been detected if present. In the case of the black solid line (model I), for example, the ring with r out/p &gt; 1.5 would have produced the anomaly with S/N &gt; 10, which is not detected in reality. Thus, we can set the upper limit of r out/p &lt; 1.5 for model I. Note that the upper limits depend on the adopted parameter set; this situation is clearly illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 20</ref>, where similar limits cannot be derived for the other models.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table  2</ref>. Assuming model I (black solid line), for example, the region with 1.5 &lt; r out/p (i.e. a part of the line above the green line) is inconsistent with the non-detection of the anomaly and thus excluded.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.-(Left) Schematic illustration of a transit of a planet with a ring.
