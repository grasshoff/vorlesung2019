				<p>Aims. We extend the results of planetary formation synthesis by computing the long-term evolution of synthetic systems from the clearing of the gas disk into the dynamical evolution phase. Methods. We use the symplectic integrator SyMBA (Duncan et al. (1998)) to numerically integrate the orbits of planets for 100Myr, using the populations in Alibert et al. (2013) as initial conditions. Results. We show that within the populations studied, mass and semi-major axis distributions experience only minor changes from post-formation evolution. We also show that, depending upon their initial distribution, planetary eccentricities can statistically increase or decrease as a result of gravitational interactions. We find that planetary masses and orbital spacings provided by planet formation models do not result in eccentricity distributions comparable to observed exoplanet eccentricities, requiring other phenomena such as e.g. stellar fly-bys to account for observed eccentricities.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the pioneering discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mayor &amp; Queloz (1995)</ref>, the number of discovered exoplanets has increased to over 1000 planets with a plethora of characteristics challenging planet formation models. The latest generation of core accretion models such as the planet formation model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alibert et al. (2013)</ref> (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alibert et al. (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Mordasini et al. (2009a,b)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fortier et al. (2013)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">et al. (2013)</ref>, henceforth referred to as A05, M09, M09b, F13 and A13, respectively) or the semi-analytical method of Ida and Lin (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ida &amp; Lin (2004</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ida et al. (2013))</ref> permits the study of planet formation not only for isolated planets, but for planets forming concurrently in the same system. This allows for the study of the effects of mutual perturbation between growing protoplanets. Thus, planetary characteristics such as eccentricity and architectural features such as period ratios -both depending on mutual interactionscan be compared against the distributions for observed exoplanets.</p><p>While the distributions of semi-major axes and planetary masses are generally well reproduced by planet formation models (see e.g. M09 and M09b), the eccentricities of synthetic giant planets are statistically smaller than those for observed exoplanets (see e.g. A13). This has been attributed to the damping effect of the gas disk during the formation phase. Studies by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref> showed that observed eccentricities can be reproduced by following the gravitational post-formation evolution of systems, but the simulations relied for their initial conditions on ad-hoc architectures of the initial systems.</p><p>It is not clear whether such architectures can actually result from the formation process.</p><p>It is therefore uncertain whether dynamical instabilities suppressed while the gas disk is still present can account for the observed exoplanet eccentricities or if other effects such as e.g. perturbations from stellar fly-bys (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Malmberg &amp; Davies (2009)</ref>) are necessary as a source of eccentric planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thommes et al. (2008)</ref>, using a code coupling a 1D gas disk evolution code with SyMBA, found that for some disk parameters, giant planets with substantial eccentricities can be formed by planet-planet and planet-disk interactions. Such planets are also obtained by A13, but their occurrence rates in the planet populations are relatively low and thus insufficient to match observed exoplanet distributions.</p><p>N-body simulations of the orbital evolution of (proto-)planets in gas disks (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McNeil et al. (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee &amp; Thommes (2009)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Matsumura et al. (2010)</ref>) found that a large number of planets ends up locked in low-order mean-motion resonances due to resonant migration.</p><p>The large sample of exoplanets observed by the Kepler spacecraft, however, does not show a similar enrichment in commensurable period ratios. Therefore, in formation models including both N-body dynamics and planet-disk interactions, a mechanism to break out of resonance is necessary to reduce the fraction of commensurable orbits.</p><p>In the present paper, we study the impact of post-formation dynamical evolution on planetary systems formed with the model of A13. We investigate whether the post-formation evolution alone can account for the observed statistical increase in eccentricities. Previous studies presented in M09b and A13 followed the formation of planets until the dispersal of the protoplanetary gas disk and typically lasted for up to T disk ∼ 10Myr. We improve on these results by following the subsequent gravitational evolution of synthetic planetary systems for an additional 100Myr after the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk, partially bridging the time gap between the formation era and the actual observation epoch. Between the time of disk dispersal and the long-term dynamically stable configurations of mature planetary systems, dynamical instabilities hitherto suppressed by the gas disk through eccentricity and inclination damping can arise, resulting in scatterings, collisions and ejections of planets from their respective systems.</p><p>In Section 2, we will briefly review the planet formation model used in this paper and discuss the procedure we employed to compute the post-formation evolution and the planetary populations studied in Section 3. We will discuss the effect on the evolved eccentricity distributions of a number of initial condition parameters as well as small stochastic perturbations in Section 4, while the post-formation evolution effects in general are presented in Section 5. Finally, we provide a brief discussion and conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Planet formation model</head><p>In the present work, we study the post-formation evolution decoupled from the planet formation process, numerically integrating the orbits of planets generated with a planet formation model. We use the planet formation model described in F13 and A13, based on earlier works (see A05 and M09), to generate populations of planetary systems in a Monte Carlo approach from initial parameters calibrated to observations (given in A13).</p><p>The Bernese model self-consistently simulates the evolution of the gas and planetesimal disks, computes the solid and gas accretion together with the internal structure of planets, and accounts for both the gravitational interaction between planets and the interaction of planets with the surrounding gas disk.</p><p>The disk structure and evolution is modelled using a 1+1D-model computing the radial and vertical structure of the disk. The time evolution of the disk is obtained from the diffusion equation for the gas disk surface density. A detailed description of the disk structure and evolution model is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Papaloizou &amp; Terquem (1999)</ref> and A05. The interactions between growing protoplanets and the gas disk are computed using the prescriptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fogg &amp; Nelson (2007)</ref> for Type I migration in the case of an isothermal disk and by setting the eccentricity damping proportional to the semi-major axis damping for planets in Type II migration. For non-isothermal disks, the migration and damping prescriptions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Paardekooper et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Paardekooper et al. ( , 2011</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dittkrist et al. (2014)</ref> are used. A more detailed description of planet-disk interactions is given in A13.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Evolution procedure</head><p>To follow the long-term evolution of the systems generated with our population synthesis code, we use the symplectic integrator SyMBA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Duncan et al. (1998)</ref>). The post-formation evolution of multiplanetary population syntheses is then obtained in the following way:</p><p>Article number, page 3 of 29</p><p>1. A population of planetary systems is generated using the planet formation model from A13. In this model, planets are followed dynamically until the gas disk mass decreases to M disk ≤ 10 −5 M . 2. The system is then evolved over 100Myr using the symplectic integrator SyMBA.</p><p>The chosen timescale for evolution of 100Myr is a compromise between the time required to explicitly integrate a system in time and the number of systems we need to integrate to obtain a statistically meaningful result. The chosen integration time of 100Myr is sufficiently large to allow for dynamical effects (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Juri´cJuri´c &amp; Tremaine (2008)</ref>, where they find a rapid drop in dynamical activity for T &gt; 100Myr in integrations running up to ∼ 1Gyr) acting on timescales longer than the disk lifetime such as e.g. for secular resonances, orbit crossing and collisions, where the timescales are typically of the order of a few Myr.</p><p>To reduce computational load and to focus on potentially observable systems, we set a minimum mass of the most massive planet (m start ) below which the system is not integrated, i.e. if no planet with m p ≥ m start is present in the system, the system is omitted from long-term integration. For the simulations studied in this paper, we set m start to 1M ⊕ .</p><p>This choice is also motivated by results from A13, where a convergence in the number of planets with a given mass is shown for planets with M p ≥ 5M ⊕ as a function of the initial number of embryos and initial conditions. For planets with M p ≤ 5M ⊕ , significant effects from initial conditions on their occurrence rates and properties cannot be excluded. These uncertainties increase with further decreasing mass.</p><p>Collisions during the post-formation evolution are treated as perfect mergers, occurring in SyMBA if the separation d ij between two objects is less than the sum of their physical radii. Note that we do not distinguish between core and envelope radius in our treatment of collisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Population synthesis</head><p>To test the effects of different parameters in the formation model, we generated several populations of planetary systems with the planet formation code (see Sec. 2), using the model described in A13.</p><p>A summary of the populations we studied is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Below, each population is briefly described. We use a criterion based on the radial velocity semi-amplitude K to select the planets in each population which we compare to a similarly selected sample of observed exoplanets, with K 10ms −1 . We do not, however, apply a cutoff based on orbital periods as the fraction of planets with orbital periods larger than ∼ 20yr -roughly the time since measurements of K ≤ 10ms −1 would have been available from e.g. the ELODIE spectrograph -is less than ∼ 3% except for the population ND (see below), where the fraction is of ∼ 13%.</p><p>Article number, page 4 of 29 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Overview of population syntheses. ne denotes the number of embryo seeds, nsys the number of systems, np (resp. np @10ms −1 ) the number of planets (resp. with a radial-velocity semi-amplitude K ≥ 10ms −1 ) and n coll and neje the number of planets removed due to collisions and ejections. The population designations refer to the reference population with 10 embryos and full damping (R), the population with 5 and 20 embryos (E5, E20), the population with no (ND) and reduced eccentricity and inclination damping (RD), and the population with a stochastic perturbation to the semi-major axes (RA) or to the inclinations (RI). The reference population against which we compare the results of changes to the initial conditions of the planet formation process (populations ND, RD, E, see below) and stochastic perturbations (populations RA and RI, see below) was generated using 10 initial embryo seeds and disk masses, disk lifetimes and dust-to-gas ratios drawn randomly from the pa- </p></div>

(2013)</ref> have already discussed the effects of changing the number of initial embryo seeds on the distributions of planetary masses and semi-major axes as well as on period ratios of neighboring planet pairs for the formation phase until the disk has dispersed. However, as the number of embryos increases, we also expect an increase in dynamical interactions. We therefore also computed the post-formation evolution of a population with the same initial conditions as the reference case, but with the number of initial embryo seeds increased to 20</p><p>(population E20), as well as a population with the same initial conditions as the reference population, but with only 5 initial embryo seeds (population E5). To maintain a similar total number of planets, a lower number of systems was simulated, resulting in a population of 3241 planets in 228 systems, of which 2238 planets remain after 100Myr, whereas a slightly larger number of systems was simulated for the population E5, resulting in 2171 planets in 483 systems, of which 2129 planets remain after 100Myr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Additional stochastic perturbations</head><p>In the Bernese planet formation model, the migration prescriptions assume that the disk is azimuthally symmetric and homogeneous. Moreover, changes due to e.g. turbulence (see e.g. Johnson et al. <ref type="formula">(2006)</ref>) which can affect the migration of low-to intermediate-mass</p><p>planets are not included in the model. To simulate the effect of stochastic perturbations on the planets, we computed the post-formation evolution of the reference population, but added a random perturbation within ±1% to the semi-major axis of each planet (population RA) before computing the post-formation evolution. This is not intended as a self-consistent scheme as the perturbation bears no effect on the formation process, but rather as cursory investigation into the effect of semi-major axis perturbation on the subsequent evolution of planetary systems. However, we also computed a second population </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results: effect of initial conditions on the eccentricity distribution</head><p>We used the post-formation evolution of a sample of 344 systems with 10 initial embryos each as the baseline against which we compared the effect of altering different aspects of the planet formation model, namely the number of embryos and the efficiency of the eccentricity (and inclination) damping due to interactions with the surrounding gas disk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The initial number of embryos</head><p>In A13, the impact of the initial number of embryo seeds on the distributions of mass and semi-major axis was studied. The distributions for 5, 10 and 20 initial embryo seeds show a converging trend both with respect to the distribution of planetary masses (for planets with M p 10M ⊕ ) and the distribution of semi-major axes. In the present work, we compared the distribution of eccentricities between the different populations, both after the initial formation phase which typically lasts a few Myr until the gas disk is dissipated, and after a subsequent gravitational evolution lasting for 100Myr after the time of disk dissipation. We find that unlike for the mass and semi-major axes, the eccentricities and their evolution differ between the populations with 5 ( We note that in all three populations the median eccentricities (and maximum eccentricities) are larger for the populations restricted to planets with K 10ms −1 . On one hand, the eccentricity damping in our model is proportional to the damping in semi-major axis and thus most efficient for planets with m p 1−10M ⊕ , the mass around which the planets enter runaway gas accretion and ultimately transition into the slower Type II migration.</p><p>By consequence, the more massive planets with K 10ms −1 migrating in Type II are less strongly damped than the lower-mass planets. On the other hand, the eccentricities</p><p>Article number, page 7 of 29 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.

Previous numerical and analytical studies (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ida &amp; Lin (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ida et al. (2013)</ref> and references therein) have found that planetary eccentricities from two-body encounters correspond to a Rayleigh distribution multiplied with the mass-weighted escape eccentricity of the encounter, the latter being <ref type="bibr">)</ref> , where a = √ a i a j is the geometric mean semimajor axis of the planets i and j, m i , m j and M respectively denote the mass of both planets and the star and where R i and R j are the planetary radii. The prescription for the resulting maximum post-encounter eccentricity is then given by e max,j = mi mi+mj R e esc,ij , where R denotes the random variate from the Rayleigh distribution. For an encounter between low-mass planets, the escape eccentricity typically remains small, such that encounters between low-mass planets only lead to small increases in eccentricity. In contrast, encounters between a low-mass planet (j) and a massive planet (i) can rapidly result in e max,j &gt; 1 and thus in the ejection of the low-mass planet without substantially increasing the eccentricity of the massive planet. Encounters between two massive planets, while still potentially resulting in ejections, increase the eccentricities of both planets and thus produce a population of massive planets with some eccentricity. This bias against eccentric, low-mass planets is further compounded in our simulations by a large number of low-mass planets in systems without any massive companion, such that low-mass planets predominately interact with other low-mass planets. The correlation between planetary masses and eccentricities, however, is also found in observed exoplanets (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ida et al. (2013)</ref>).    </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">defined as e esc,ij = vesc,ij v K = (mi+mj )a M(Ri+Rj</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Eccentricity damping</head><p>A13 presented results for population syntheses with modified eccentricity damping timescales and found that including no eccentricity and inclination damping (ND) or increased damping timescales (RD) quite naturally led to populations with significantly larger eccentricities. We computed the post-formation evolution of the same populations to study the effect of reduced eccentricity damping during formation on the final architecture of planetary systems. We found that in both cases with modified damping, the median eccentricities of the populations of planets with K 10ms −1 decrease over time, from e = 0.148 to e = 0.129 (ND) and from e = 0.102 to e = 0.095. For the full populations, the median eccentricity decreases in the case of no damping, dropping to e = 0.066 from e = 0.122 at the time of disk dispersal, whereas the median eccentricity increases from e = 1.0 · 10 −3 at the time of disk dispersal to e = 2.2 · 10 −3 after 100Myr.</p><p>Contrary to our original expectation that eccentricities would grow throughout the postformation evolution, we find that in both populations, the median eccentricity for planets with K 10ms −1 decreases over 100Myr. This is explained by the fact that starting with larger post-formation eccentricities and inclinations, the systems are more dynamically active, which leads to more collisions and ejections. The latter typically only affect planets with eccentricities close to or larger than unity, as we consider a planet to be ejected from the system if its heliocentric distance r p ≥ 1000AU and only very few planets are scattered onto wide orbits with moderate eccentricities. This eventually leads to a decrease in eccentricity not fully compensated by enventual excitation of the remaining body in a two-body encounter (see <ref type="bibr">Sec. 4.1)</ref>. In addition to the loss of eccentric planets through ejections, collisions also reduce the eccentricities. This can be more readily understood from evaluating the angular momentum deficit of a planet, introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Laskar (1997)</ref> Article number, page 10 of 29 <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Semi-major axis versus eccentricity for all planets in the 10 embryo population without eccentricity damping which would produce a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K 10ms −1 . The upper panel corresponds to the initial distribution, the lower panel to the distribution after 100Myr. The colorscale corresponds to the logarithm of the planetary mass in Earth masses, while the red solid line denotes the eccentricity at a given semi-major axis for which the periastron separation results in the planet's removal from the simulation.</p></div>

The AMD characterizes the degree of non-linearity in a given orbit. For purely secular systems, the total angular momentum deficit, given by the sum over all individual C i , is conserved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Laskar (2000)</ref> notes that in a fully elastic collision, the total angular momentum deficit of the colliding pair decreases. By consequence, the inclination and/or eccentricity of the resulting planet tend to be lower than the eccentricities of the parent bodies. As the planets in our simulations are generally on well-separated orbits, only eccentric planets undergo collisions, thus again removing the more eccentric planets from the population.</p><p>The relatively large fraction of collisions is due to large initial populations of planets with Safronov numbers Θ &lt; 1, for which the preferred outcome of close encounters are collisions rather than ejections. These large fractions (&gt; 94% for both ND and RD) are due to a large number of both close-in and low-mass planets for which the local orbital escape velocity is larger than the surface escape velocity, such that a scattering by the planet is not likely to eject the scattered planet from the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Stochastic perturbations</head><p>A13 found that the fraction of planet pairs with period ratios close to the nominal locations of low-order mean motion resonances are significantly larger than for observed exoplanets.  As resonances can stabilize otherwise unstable systems and thus have an important effect on the eccentricitiy evolution of planetary systems, stochastic perturbations to orbital elements from e.g. density fluctuations in the disk can perturb planets out of resonance and thereby increase the likelihood of strong dynamical interaction (scatterings and collisions).</p><p>To evaluate the effect of small stochastic perturbations, we computed the post-formation evolution for two modified versions of the reference population (R). In the first case, we i.e. the perturbation effects were applied to the full formation process rather than just perturbing the final orbital elements. The population RA has the same median eccentricities as the reference population for planets with K 10ms −1 , with medians e = 0.030 at the time of disk dispersal and e = 0.029 after 100Myr. For the full population, the median eccentricity after 100Myr is slightly larger than in the reference population, with e 2 · 10 −3 versus e = 1.2 · 10 −3 . Similarly, the eccentricities for the population with perturbed inclinations (RI) are comparable to the eccentricites in the reference population.</p><p>For planets with K 10ms −1 , the median eccentricity after 100Myr is even slightly lower than in the reference population, with e = 0.028 versus e = 0.029. We conclude that the stochastic perturbations we applied to planetary inclinations or semi-major axes have negligible influence on the final eccentricities of planet populations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparison with observations</head><p>As already stated in A13, no attempt was made to have the synthetic systems reproduce the observed ones. Hence, we did not expect the evolved synthetic population's characteristics to match the observed one either. Nevertheless, we compared the eccentricity distributions of the simulated planet populations to the eccentricity distribution of observed exoplanets 1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 9</ref>), limiting all samples to planets with K ≥ 10ms −1 . We  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results: post-formation evolution effects</head><p>In addition to the change in planetary eccentricities, the post-formation also potentially affects the distributions of other quantities. We compared the mass, semi-major axis and period ratio distributions as well as the chemical composition of planets at the time of disk dispersal and after 100Myr.</p><p>The fraction of planets removed by the post-formation evolution strongly depends on both the number of embryos and the efficiency of eccentricity and inclination damping. In the reference population, ∼ 11% of planets present at the end of the formation phase are removed by collisions and ejections. For the population E5, this amount drops to &lt; 2% while for E20, it increases to ∼ 30% mostly due to a significant increase in the number of collisions compared to the reference population. Reducing the efficiency of eccentricity and inclination damping by a factor of 10 (population RD) results in a slight increase in the fraction of removed planets (∼ 13%) through an increase in the fraction of ejected planets (∼ 3% for RD versus &lt; 1% for R), while completely removing the eccentricity and inclination damping results in ∼ 23% of all planets removed through collisions and ejections, with marked increase in both types of removal. The situation is similar for the fraction of systems experiencing collisions and/or ejections in each population (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), with a sharp increase for increasing number of embryos and an increase for decreasing damping.</p><p>Any change in the distribution of mass, semi-major axis or period ratios is therefore likely most pronounced in the populations E20 and ND. or ejections, increases from f sys,active = 36% in the reference population to f sys,active = 57% in the perturbed population. The large increase in activity despite the rather small perturbation suggests that many systems in our reference population are close to instability.</p><p>Most likely, such instabilities are stabilized by the presence of mean-motion resonances, which are then broken by the semi-major axis perturbations. The lack of a significant increase in eccentricity for the perturbed population, however, implies that the increased activity predominately affects the lower-mass planets. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Overview of planet removal. np denotes the number of planets present after the formation phase, nsys denotes the number of systems in the population, f lost denotes the fraction of planets removed by ejections and collisions during the post-formation evolution, and fsys,active denotes the fraction of systems experiencing collision, ejections or both. The population designations refer to the reference population with 10 embryos and full damping (R), the population with 5 and 20 embryos (E5, E20), the population with no (ND) and reduced eccentricitiy and inclination damping (RD), and the population with a stochastic perturbation to the semi-major axes (RA) or to the inclinations (RI). </p></div>

Including a random line-of-sight inclination drawn from i ∼ sin i (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ho &amp; Turner (2011)</ref>) to compute the m sin i, we find that our planets have a smaller median m sin i than observed exoplanets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 14)</ref>. Moreover, using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all populations studied show a better agreement with the observed mass distribution for the true population rather than for the sin i corrected distribution (cf. Tab. 3). Indeed, the null hypothesis that the m sin i are drawn from the same distribution as observed exoplanet m sin i cannot be rejected only for the population E5. Comparing the true masses to observed m sin i, the null hypothesis can only be rejected for the population ND, whereas the remaining populatios are in solid agreement with the observed distribution. As m ≥ m sin i, the (massive) planets in our populations appear to be somewhat less massive overall than observed exoplanets. In addition to the planets remaining after 100Myr, we also tracked the masses of planets ejected both during finding that free-floating planets in the jovian mass range are about twice as common as main-sequence stars. Even though the planetary mass functions in our simulations are comparable to the planetary mass function for observed exoplanets, our simulations generally produce only few ejections (see above) and an even lower fraction of ejected planets with masses m 100M ⊕ . Of all planets with m ≥ 100M ⊕ , only 7% are ejected from simulations with the full eccentricity and inclination damping (populations R, E5, E20 and RA), and ∼ 19% and ∼ 43, respectively, for the population with reduced (RD) and without (ND) eccentricity damping. With the fraction of planets with m ≥ 100M ⊕ between 5% and 10% in our simulations, ejections during the formation phase and the post-formation evolution alone cannot explain a large population of jovian-mass free-floating planets.

With the number of scattered planets being smaller than the number of planets undergoing collisions, the changes in the distributions are an effect of removing a part of the population rather than of changing the semi-major axes of the planets. The latter is also evidenced by the lack of change in the distribution of period ratios (see Section 5.4).  Comparing the initial and final distribution of mass fractions of water for the planetary cores f H2O,core (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 17</ref>), we find that post-formation evolution globally has a minimal impact on f H2O,core as the population median remains at f H2O,core = 0.284. The spread in f H2O,core decreases somewhat as the lower quartile increases from f H2O,core = 0.241 to f H2O,core = 0.255, indicating that in our simulation, post-formation evolution reduced the amount of "dry" planets. Comparing the evolution of the distribution of f H2O,core at different mass and semi-major axis ranges <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figs. 18 and 19, respectively)</ref>, we find that planets with m p ≤ 1M ⊕ and planets with a p ≤ 0.5AU exhibit significant change in f H2O,core whereas more massive planets and planets on wider orbits show almost no change in f H2O,core . However, for close-in, low-mass planets, the fraction of "dry" planets shows a slight increase after 100Myr.</p></div>

The latter might be partly due to the relatively low dynamical activity in the populations we studied as there is a clear correlation between the dynamical activity (gauged by proxy of using the number of ejections and collisions and the fraction of systems exhibiting either) and the amount of change between distributions at the time of disk dispersal and after 100Myr for both semi-major axis and mass distributions. This low amount of change in distributions even in the most dynamically active population for planets with between planet formation results and observed exoplanets, such as M09b, therefore are a warranted approach.</p></div>

For period ratios, increasing the initial number of embryos decreases the fraction of planet pairs with period ratios close to the nominal location of low-order mean-motion resonances, but this fraction remains relatively unchanged by the post-formation evolution.</p></div>

In all populations except for E5, where the very low number of dynamical events with n event = 36 makes statistics somewhat unreliable, 90% of all events happen within the first 50Myr of post-formation integration time, leading us to conclude that for most systems, 100Myr represent a sufficiently long time to transition from the formation phase to long-term stable configurations.</p></div>

(2011)</ref>. While this claim is disputed by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Veras &amp; Raymond (2012)</ref>, a sizeable population of planets ejected from their birth systems might still exist.</p><p>In our populations, planets are ejected both during the formation phase and during the post-formation evolution. Unlike the large fraction of jovian mass planets claimed by microlensing observations, the ejected planets in our populations have median masses m ≤ 2M ⊕ , and the fraction of ejected planets with m M Jup versus the total number of planets with m M Jup in a given population are 5% for the populations with full eccentricity and inclination damping, ∼ 19% for the population with reduced damping and ∼ 33% for the population without damping. We therefore do not produce the large number of free-floating jovian planets expected from microlensing surveys. If a large number of free-floating planets would be confirmed, this would imply either a different formation mechanism for such planets, e.g. through gravitational instabilities in the outer disk (see Boss (2011)), or a significantly larger amount of dynamical interactions during and after the formation phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Comparison with previous studies</head><p>The low number of ejected giant planets is at odds with assumptions on the initial con- , ranging from b = 2 in MD09 to b = 4.4 in C08 and active systems in JT08. In contrast, the planets with K 10ms −1 in our reference population have a (slightly) larger median separation of b = 5.2. The timescale for orbit crossing for a given planet pair strongly depends on the orbital separation (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhou et al. (2007)</ref>), such that even the moderate increase in separation between planets results in a strongly reduced amount of dynamical activity in our simulations. Moreover, the assumptions on planetary masses, especially on the frequent occurrence of multiple jovian-mass planets in a single system, are not reproduced by any population in our simulations. Indeed, the fraction of systems with more than one planet with m p ≥ 30M ⊕ 0.1M Jup in our reference population is ∼ 22%, the fraction of systems with more than two such planets is only ∼ 3%. If we set the mass limit to m p ≥ 1M Jup , the respective fractions drop to 11% and 1%. Clearly, the assumptions on the initial conditions in C08, JT08 and MD09 are not reproduced by the planet formation model we use.</p><p>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Thommes et al.

The populations RD and ND (with reduced and no eccentricity damping) in particular produce several eccentric giant planets and show the best initial agreement with observed exoplanet eccentricities. For both populations, Article number, page 26 of 29 however, the final eccentricities are reduced by the efficient removal of eccentric planets by means of ejections and collisions, resulting in less agreement with observed exoplanet distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">External perturbation as a source of dynamical activity</head><p>With the exception of the population without eccentricity and inclination damping, our populations have typical eccentricities much lower than those of observed exoplanets.</p><p>Despite uncertainties on whether some of the observed highly eccentric exoplanets could be better explained by multiplanet systems with smaller eccentricities, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anglada- Escudé et al.

(2013)</ref>, the post-formation evolution of our populations is insufficient to reproduce observed eccentricities, thus requiring additional sources of eccentricity. In our simulations, we consider the forming systems to be isolated, whereas star formation and, by consequence, planet formation typically takes place in clusters. Studies by e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Malmberg et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Malmberg et al. (2011)</ref> have shown that in their reference cluster, a solar-mass star on average has four close encounters 4 and ∼ 75% have at least two close encounters. Roughly half of these close encounters take place during the first 10Myr, which is of the same order as the disk lifetimes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mamajek (2009)</ref>), and ∼ 90% happen within 100Myr. These stellar flybys can affect the dynamical evolution of nascent planetary systems in two ways: by either directly scattering or ejecting planets in the case of very strong encounters, or by reducing the stability of the system by increasing eccentricities and/or inclinations and potentially force planets out of stabilizing mean-motion resonances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Malmberg et al. (2011)</ref> found that between ∼ 40% and ∼ 60% of their systems underwent ejections or orbit-crossings after a stellar fly-by, implying that the contributions from stellar encounters to the final architecture of planetary systems could be significant. The inclusion of stellar fly-bys in the current planet formation model will be the topic of future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>Within the first 100Myr of evolution after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk, planetary systems can undergo dramatic changes in orbital architecture through planet-planet scattering, ejections and collisions. These dynamical interactions are necessary to bring the eccentricities of planet populations in the Bernese planet formation model in line with observed exoplanet eccentricities. However, the effect of the post-formation evolution on the eccentricity distributions alone remains insufficient to explain observed eccentricities, requiring further investigation into the assumptions on initial conditions as well as the inclusion of additional sources of dynamical perturbation such as stellar fly-bys in our model. While the eccentricities clearly show the effects of post-formation evolution, other plane-tary characteristics such as the mass and semi-major axis distributions remain largely the same after 100Myr as at the time of disk dispersal, implying that the mass and semi-major axis of a planet are by and large determined by the formation process alone.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>rameter distributions described in A13. The disk masses vary from M d = 0.001M to M d = 0.3M , with a dust-to-gas ratio scaled to the metallicity of the star. The gas disk masses are derived from Andrews et al. (2010), where a dust-to-gas ratio of f d/g = 0.01 is assumed. The solid disk mass is computed by scaling the mass of the solid disk according to the randomly drawn stellar metallicity from a list of ∼ 1000 CORALIE targets (see also A13) with a new f d/g . In our simulations, most disks are low-mass, with ∼ 62% of all disks having M d ≤ 0.03M . Disk lifetimes T disk are chosen from an exponentially decay- ing cumulative distribution function with characteristic time T = 2.5Myr (see Mamajek (2009)). The photoevaporation rate is then adjusted to yield M d = 10 −5 M at T = T disk . Finally, embryos are seeded throughout the disk. All embryos have a starting mass of M = 10 −2 M ⊕ and an initial semi-major axis randomly drawn from a log-uniform distribu- tion between 0.1AU and 20AU, with an added constraint that embryos are located at least 10 times their mutual Hill radius from each other. After all systems in the population have reached M disk ≤ 10 −5 M , the systems containing no planet with M p ≥ m start were filtered out, while the remaining systems were integrated for an additional 100Myr to follow the post-formation evolution under the mutual gravitational interactions of the planets alone (i.e. any residual gas or planetesimal disk and tidal interactions were not included). This resulted in a population of 2834 planets in 344 systems being evolved beyond the formation phase, with 2519 planets remaining after 100Myr.

The resulting populations without any eccentricity or inclination damping (population ND) and with the damping timescales increased by a factor of 10 with respect to the damping timescale prescription given in Alibert et al.

Nevertheless, the median eccentricity of e = 0.095 after 100Myr is still smaller than the median eccentricity of observed exoplanets (e = 0.15). A possible source of this difference is the inclusion of planets around stars with no further detected planetary mass companions, but possible distant stellar companions, in the sample of exoplanets. Excluding all exoplanets in sys- tems with multiple stellar components (list taken from Roell et al. (2012)), however, still yields a median eccentricity of e = 0.14 and does not appreciably change the eccentricity distribution except for the removal of a few highly eccentric planets such as e.g. HD 20782 b (see Jones et al. (2006)). A possible source of additional eccentricity not yet included in our model are perturbations by stellar fly-bys, which can increase planetary eccentricities both by direct perturbations and by destabilizing planetary systems, thus increasing the incidence of strong dynamical interactions, see e.g. Malmberg et al. (2011). 1 We take the exoplanet data from www.exoplanets.eu, a catalog taking a conservative approach to the inclusion of planet data, see Schneider et al. (2011).</figDesc></figure>

Reducing the efficiency of eccentricity and inclination damping by increasing the damping timescale by a factor of 10 does not significantly change the period ratio distributions compared to the reference case (see Figure 23). Completely removing the damping, however, produces a starkly different distribution with no discernable population of pairs in low-order mean motion resonances (Figure 24). The population with a random perturbation to the semi-major axes (population RA), while showing an overally similar distribution of period ratios for planets with K ≥ 10ms −1 , has a lower fraction of planets within ±1% of the nominal locations of low-order mean motion resonances after 100Myr compared to the reference population. The ratio of the frac- tion of systems within one percent of the 2 : 1 mean motion resonance in the reference population at the end and at the beginning of the post-formation evolution, for instance, is f 2:1,f in /f 2:1,ini = 0.17/0.18 ≈ 0.94, whereas the same ratio for the population RA is f 2:1,f in /f 2:1,ini = 0.10/0.14 ≈ 0.71 comparable to the values for the population with more initial embryo seeds (E20) which has f 2:1 0.15 initially and f 2:1 0.11 after the post- formation evolution. Compared to f 2:1 0.05 for observed exoplanet pairs, this is still considerably larger and points to our model either lacking strong dynamical interactions which could force the probably resonant planet pairs away from resonance, or having an overly efficient migration producing (too) many pairs in resonance. Both possibilities would also affect the distribution of eccentricities discussed in Sec. 4.4.</figDesc></figure>
