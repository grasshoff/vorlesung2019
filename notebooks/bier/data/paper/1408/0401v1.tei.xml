			<abstract>
				<p>Since the discovery of the first exoplanets (planets outside our Solar System) more than 20 years ago, there has been an increasing need for photometric and spectroscopic models to characterize these systems. While imaging has been used extensively for Solar System bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of typical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them. Spatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or spectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on photometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number of phenomena that can be exploited for characterization. First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and characterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We demonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and orbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example, radial velocity measurements. Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter, using the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic errors from iii the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to look for the very faint light reflected by the planet. We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility of transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars in galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center. Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits. This method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation or orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 not only to learn more about stellar rotation, but also to investigate the size and contrast of the spots themselves. iv</p>

I thank my parents, my sisters, and other members of my extended but close family; fellow students and educators during my formal and informal education, especially high school; and friends. These people play a key role in my life, and are responsible for that when I enrolled to Harvard four years ago, I felt I was ready.</p><p>I would like to express gratitude to a large number of astronomers who accepted my younger self with no formal training in their discipline as one of them, and helped me along my apprenticeship. First of all, I thank Gáspár Bakos, who recruited me as a research assistant and introduced me to exoplanets and people in this field. I thank Matt Holman for taking over the role of my advisor after Gáspár left for another university and was not successful in convincing me to leave the CfA behind.</p><p>I am also grateful to a large number of people who volunteered their time and advice without being labeled advisors: Dave Kipping and Bob Noyes, with whom I had regular weekly meetings throughout the last two years, Bence Kocsis, who gave me the opportunity to lead the research paper based on his idea, and many, many other people, whom I had the opportunity to consult with regularily or occasionally.</p><p>This includes collaborators and coauthors, mentors, lecturers, and people I met at SSP coffee, exoplanet pizza lunch, and other scientific gatherings. I am especially indebted to the Mount Hopkins Observatory staff for their infinite patience with me as I made my debut as an observer.</p><p>When one thinks about whom they learned the most from, it is easy to think only about senior people and forget about peers. However, my confusion was often so great that I would have been ashamed to seek help of anyone other than the folks who xviii still remember vividly their own struggles with astronomy: fellow graduate students.</p><p>They did not leave a single question of mine unanswered, and every interaction left me humbled by how much more there was for me to learn.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Peg Herlihy, Robb Scholten, and Donna</p><p>Adams, without whom I would not have had an office, an advisor, stipend, healthcare, I could not have taken a single class, I could not have taught, I could not have loaned a</p><p>single book from the library, I could not have entered the building after 17:30, and I would have been deported from the US, just to name a few things.</p><p>Being an astronomer is about more than just astronomy, and being a graduate student is about more than just being in graduate school. I am grateful for all the people who kept reminding me of this in the past years, including friends that I met through CouchSurfing, through the local Hungarian community, and through other stochastic processes; fellow graduate students who showed me that they also have a non-astronomer side; but most of all, Katherine Beaty, who has earned a special place in my heart and on my ring finger. And I thank Owen Gingerich and Charles Alcock for making it possible that she put that ring on my finger in the dome of the Great</p><p>Refractor. The first planets known to humanity are those visible to the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The earliest written observations of these objects come from the Babylonian civilization, dating back to second millenium BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">(Sachs, 1974</ref>). The word "planet" originates from ancient Greek πλανήτης (plan¯ et¯ es), meaning wanderer, as they move across the sky with respect to stars. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were the five planets in Greek astronomy after Pythagoras or Parmenides correctly identified the evening star and morning star as the same object, Venus (Aphrodite in Greek) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Burnet, 2007)</ref>. Paradoxially, Earth, the planet closest to humankind, with the largest apparent size, has only been proposed to be a planet in the early 1500s, by the Polish astronomer Mikoo laj Kopernik (Latinized as Nicolaus Copernicus). His framework, known as the heliocentric system, only became widely accepted two centuries later, with the advent of telescopic observations.</p><p>The rest of the Solar System planets were discovered using what were considered large telescopes at the time: Uranus in 1781 by William Herschel, and Neptune by</p><p>Urbain Le Verrier and Johann Gottfried Galle in 1846.</p><p>Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, although it had been captured on photographic plates fifteen times before since as early as 1909. It was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, leaving us with eight Solar System planets. However, it has not been the first object demoted from being a planet: the Sun and the Moon were thought of as planets until the acceptance of the heliocentric system, although the concept of planet had necessarily been less refined at the time. After the discovery of Uranus, a number of other celestial bodies were discovered and labelled as planets, most notably Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, between 1801 and 1807. At the time of the discovery of Neptune, it was considered the 13th planet, until around 1850, when the others were reclassified as asteroids. Ceres was reclassified again in 2006, as a dwarf planet, together with Pluto <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Forbes, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hughes &amp; Marsden, 2007</ref>).</p><p>The quest for discovering exoplanets (or extrasolar planets, that is, planets outside our Solar System) was held back until very recently by their distance: α Centauri Bb, the closest known potential exoplanet, is ten thousand times as far from the Earth as Neptune, the furthest planet within the Solar System. It is not possible to look up the night sky and spot such a remote planet with the naked eye, and direct observations even with very powerful telescopes are rare.</p><p>However, not all Solar System planets were discovered by scouring around the sky:</p><p>the presence of Neptune was deducted by the irregular motion of Uranus. In 1843, John</p><p>Couch Adams started to examine observations of Uranus to predict the position of Neptune, which was discovered a few years later based on the independent calculations of Urbain Le Verrier. This teaches us an important lesson: looking into your telescope pointed at a random field on the sky is not the only way to look for planets. Sometimes, observing another object like a planet or a star will provide indirect evidence of a new planet, even without being able to directly see it.</p><p>Another important lesson from history is that sometimes what was thought to be a planet turns out to be something else. In case of the Solar System, only the meaning of the word "planet" evolved, without actually changing the physical nature of the Sun, the Moon, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Pluto, and many others. For indirectly discovered exoplanets, however, reanalysis of data or gathering more observations might reveal that what was thought to be a planet is too massive to be one, does not exist at all, or is indeed a planet but with a different orbital period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Exoplanet detection methods</head><p>L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.</p><p>Antoine <ref type="bibr">de Saint Exupéry (1943)</ref> Exoplanets can be detected with a number of methods. We briefly review the most important ones in this section. The takeaway message is that no method is superior:</p><p>they have different biases, limitations, and costs.</p><p>Biases are important, because we need to account for them when inferring the ensemble distribution of planet parameters from the distribution of known planets.</p><p>They are also important when choosing a method, designing an instrument, and setting up an observing strategy for the specific goal of finding planets of certain properties, for example, ones that might potentially harbor life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">Direct imaging</head><p>Just like Uranus was discovered as a small bright object in the field of the telescope, it is possible to resolve an exoplanet, that is, separate the light from two objects: the planet and its host star. For a telescope with an optical element of diameter d, at wavelength λ, diffraction of light limits the angular resolution to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ « 1.22λ d .</formula><p>A quick order-of-magnitude calculation tells us that for a nearby star at 10 pc, observed by a 10 meter telescope at 1 µm, this translates to a projected star-planet distance of 0.25 AU. At this distance, the starlight reflected by the planet is too faint compared to the star to be detected with current technology, therefore direct imaging is limited to the thermal radiation originating from the planets themselves, typically observed in the infrared. This is essentially different from the situation in our Solar System, where every planet on the sky was first detected using light that originated from the Sun and reflected off the planet. Direct imaging observations favor young, massive planets, because they have more residual heat, and a larger surface to radiate. These biases are reflected by the fact that until recently, all directly imaged exoplanets were younger than 50 Ma ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Kuzuhara et al., 2013)</ref>, and with the exception of Fomalhaut b, all have a inferred planetary mass at least four times that of Jupiter. So far, eight planets have been discovered by direct imaging. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2">Timing variations</head><p>While direct imaging is the natural extension of observations of Solar System planets, the first exoplanets were discovered using different methods. One of the first discoveries is based on timing variation of radio signals. The millisecond pulsar PSR 1527 + 12 is a rapidly rotating object that emits radio waves synchronously to its rotation at a highly regular rate, every 6.2 ms. As a planet orbits the pulsar, the pulsar does not remain stationary: in fact, both of them orbit their common barycenter. During this orbit, both objects periodically approach and recede as seen by the observer. Since the radio emission rate of the pulsar is very stable, this radial displacement can be detected in the timing of the radio signals, because it takes light a little longer to reach the observer when the pulsar is furher away. Two planets were detected around PSR 1527 + 12 via this effect, even though they change the pulsation period by only ˘15 ps <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">(Wolszczan &amp; Frail, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Timing effects are also used to discover non-transiting planets via the transit timing variations (TTV) of transiting planets in the same system. For example, the transit times of Kepler-19b deviate from strictly periodic by up to approximately five minutes, revealing the presence of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-19c (Ballard et al., 2011</ref>). Dynamical arguments give a lower limit of 0.1 M C for the mass of <ref type="bibr">Kepler-19c</ref>. Another example of analyzing TTVs to constrain planetary masses is the Kepler-88 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al., 2013)</ref>. This method can sometimes also be applied to targets that are too faint for radial velocity measurements.</p><p>Timing variations are limited to systems exhibiting very regularly periodic behaviour.</p><p>In the above cases, we are limited to planets transiting a millisecond pulsar, and planets that strongly interact with already discovered transiting ones. To date, less than two dozen planets have been discovered via some kind of timing phenomenon. 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.3">Radial velocity</head><p>Just like with millisecond pulsar timing, planets orbiting stars can be detected by their gravitational pull on the star, if we can measure the radial velocity of the host star precisely enough. This can be done via spectroscopic observations: the observed wavelength of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum are influenced by the radial velocity of the star via the Doppler effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Marcy &amp; Butler, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Seager, 2011)</ref>. Targeted surveys of main sequence stars are fruitful methods of discovering new planets, albeit very expensive in terms of observations, because typically dozens of observations with medium to large telescopes are required for discovering such planets. So far, hundreds of planets have been discovered via radial velocity observations. 1</p><p>Radial velocity measurements are important not only for discovering planets, but also for the mass determination of planets discovered by other methods, like transits.</p><p>However, when other methods are not available for characterizing the planet, radial velocity observations by themselves are not able to resolve the degeneracy between planetary mass m and orbital inclination i, as they only constrain the product m sin i.</p><p>The biases associated with radial velocity measurements are the following: first, since the primary measured quantity is radial velocity, massive planets and those with short periods are favored as they result in larger stellar radial velocity amplitude. Second, as rapidly rotating stars have broad spectral features that hinder precise radial velocity determination, rapidly rotating stars like massive main sequence A stars and very young stars are usually excluded from observing campaigns. Third, spectroscopic reference lines from ionine cells and ThAr lamps are densest at optical wavelengths, therefore RV surveys were historically biased against cooler stars like M dwarfs, because their emission mostly falls in the infrared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.4">Transits</head><p>The orbital orientation of a planet might be such that it gets in between the star and the observer once every orbit. In this case, the planet blocks part of the star's light, which we observe as a periodical dip in the stellar lightcurve (brightness as a function of time). This method is fairly unique in that the depth of the transit reveals the planetary radius relative to the stellar radius. In addition, the transit lightcurve by itself allows for measuring the density of the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Seager, 2011</ref>).</p><p>Compared to other methods, transits are relatively inexpensive to observe: a transiting survey can monitor tens of thousands of stars in a single field simultaneously for brightness variations. It is therefore not suprising that most known transiting exoplanets have been discovered by transits, more than a thousand by now. 1</p><p>However, special configurations of background stars or hierachical triple systems might mimic the behaviour a transiting system, thus usually other observations are required to confirm the planetary nature of the system. Therefore it is not uncommon for transiting exoplanet surveys to focus their efforts on targets that are known to be feasible targets for radial velocity measurements, that is, relatively bright stars that are not fast rotators. This is also beneficial because transits tell us about the planetary size, and radial velocity measurements confine the mass, providing us with the unique opportunity to determine planetary density and thus potentially learn about the composition of the planet.</p><p>Ground-based transiting exoplanet surveys will be discussed in detail in Section 1.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.5">Gravitational microlensing</head><p>Gravitational microlensing happens when two stars are almost perfectly aligned as seen by the observer. In this case, the gravitational field of the foreground star acts a magnifying lens, enhancing the light from the background star. Such events usually last for days of weeks, because of the motion of the background star, the foreground star, and the Solar System with the observer in it, in space. If the lensing star has a planet, it may be revealed as a second spike in the microlensing light curve if the planet is in a favorable location during the event. To date, 18 planets have been discovered 1 via this phenomenon: 10 by the MOA project ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Street et al., 2013)</ref>, and 8 by <ref type="bibr">OGLE (Kains et al., 2013</ref>).</p><p>The unique charactestic of microlensing is that these are rare events, usually only happening once to a system. Therefore this method cannot constrain orbital period directly, only planetary mass and projected separation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.6">Orbital brightness modulation</head><p>A planet might influence the total brightness of the system even if it does not transit the star. For example, as the planet goes through phases during the orbit, the amount of reflected starlight changes periodically. This has been measured for a number of known planets, but the first planets discovered through this effect are <ref type="bibr">Kepler-70b and Kepler-70c (Charpinet et al., 2011</ref>). This method is biased toward large, close-in planets with high albedos, because they reflect more starlight.</p><p>In addition, radial motion of stars result in tiny brightness variations due to relativistic beaming, allowing for detection of planets. The first such discovery was Kepler-76b</p><p>by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Faigler et al. (2013)</ref>. In the lightcurve analysis, the authors also account for starlight reflected by the planet, and variations due to the ellipsoidal shape of the star caused by tidal forces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.7">Polarimetry</head><p>Starlight is unpolarized, whereas reflection from the planetary atmosphere is partially polarized. This effect has been observed, for example, for the exoplanet HD 189733b</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Berdyugina et al., 2008</ref>), but no previously unknown planets have been discovered yet with this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.8">Astrometry</head><p>Just like a planet induces periodic motion of its host star in the radial direction (unless the orbit is in the sky plane), it does so in the sky plane too. Therefore astrometry, that is, careful observation of the position of the star, could potentially reveal exoplanets.</p><p>This effect has not been observed for any planetary host yet.</p><p>However, astrometry sometimes plays an important role in ruling out transiting binary systems mimicking transit behaviour. For the transit depth to be reasonable for a planet, the light of a binary system must be blended together with light from a field star. This system might not be resolved by the instrument, but astrometric measurements could reveal that the light is coming more from the field star during transit than at other times. Note, however, that it is not physical motion of a star that is detected in this case, but an artifact due to the structure of the blended source.</p><p>Not detecting such "astrometric" variations decreases the likelihood of a false positive (Torres et al., 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Planet factories</head><p>The most successful transiting exoplanet discovery project by the number of planets is the Kepler Space Satellite, with hundreds of confirmed and validated detections to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Borucki et al., , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Batalha et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Burke et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rowe et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>While there are other satellites looking for exoplanets, the next most fruitful efforts are ground-based surveys: WASP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">Pollacco et al., 2006</ref>) with 64 planets, and HATNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bakos et al., 2004</ref>) and HATSouth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bakos et al., 2013</ref>) with a total of 43 planets discovered to date. 1 In this section, we highlight a few aspects of these ground-based surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">Instrument design</head><p>The HATNet, HATSouth, and WASP surveys use commercially available telephoto lenses or telescopes measuring 11 cm, 18 cm, and 20 cm in diameter, respectively. While part of the reason for the relatively small size compared to other professional telescopes is to keep the design simple and costs low, the planetary discovery rate does not seem to suffer from the relatively small apertures. The reason is that transiting system candidates are typically confirmed using radial velocity (RV) follow-up measurements, which would become costly for stars fainter than " 14 visual magnitude, and for brighter stars, these apertures already collect enough light for successful identification. Brighter stars require shorter exposures not only for RV measurements, but also for spectroscopic observations of transits, which would allow us to learn about the composition of the planetary atmosphere. With such observations, longer exposures can be overly complicated: with the Hubble Space Telescope, for example, each exposure is limited to approximately 40 minutes, before the spacecraft hides behind the Earth on its orbit.</p><p>Also, if the required exposure time exceeds the length of the transit, observations taken at multiple transits need to be combined.</p><p>Given that the scientific goal of HATNet, HATSouth, and WASP is to find a large number of transiting exoplanets that are suitable for various follow-up observations, and that the entire sky has not been surveyed yet for transiting exoplanets, they were designed to be wide angle, shallow surveys. They employ fast optics, with focal ratios between f {1.8 and f {2.8, resulting in a field between 4 ˝ and 8 ˝ on the side, with tens of thousands of stars down to fourteenth magnitude for each telescope.</p><p>In a ground-based survey, the observed brightness of targets is influenced by systematic effects due to the atmosphere. The amount of light taken away by the atmosphere (extinction) depends on the amount of Earth's atmosphere the light from the star has to traverse to reach the telescope (airmass). Extinction is function of humidity, but also zenith angle, so it changes throughout the night as the target star rises and sets, and as weather conditions change. To separate this effect from the astrophysical brightness variations, a number of stable stars are selected in the same field, and their brightness is compared. To complicate things, the wavelength-dependent scattering in air results in different extinction for stars of different color, a phenomenon known as differential extinction. This necessitates a large number of stars in the field among which appropriate ones can be chosen as photometric reference, also justifying wide fields for photometric surveys. The HATNet and HATSouth surveys use the Trend Filtering Algorithm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Kovács et al., 2005</ref>) to remove systematics using lightcurves of reference stars, and the External Parameter Decorrelation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bakos et al., 2007b</ref>) to account for effects based on where the telescope was pointing and where the star fell on the detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">Observing strategy</head><p>After deciding on the hardware: shallow, wide field versus deep, narrow field, the next major decision is in the observing strategy: observe one field for many months, or a new field every week. At the two extremes, a very short campaign could not cover two consecutive transits that are indispensible for determining the orbital period, and a very long campaign would have a small marginal discovery rate, because all short period planets are already discovered, while long period transiting planets are a lot less frequent due to the lower geometric probability of a transit.</p><p>It is important to note that typical transits last for a few hours, therefore a singlelongitude survey has a good chance of missing any particular one. In light of this, it is not surprising that the continuous sky coverage (weather permitted) provided by the three HATSouth sites spread out in longitude results in an expected planet recovery fraction exceeding three times that of a single site ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bakos et al., 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.3">Follow-up observations</head><p>Once a planet host candidate is identified from the small aperture photometric observations, typically three kinds of follow-up observations are performed: reconnaissance spectroscopy to determine the spectral type of the star, photometry to refine transit parameters, and RV measurements to constrain the mass and orbital eccentricity of the planet.</p><p>Reconnaissance spectroscopy is typically done on a one meter class telescope. A small number of exposures are usually enough to tell a main sequence star from a giant. This is very important, because the object that causes a 1% deep transit in the lightcurve of a giant star is too large to be a planet. Many eclipsing binary systems can also be ruled out based on their double-lined spectra.</p><p>At this step, the spectral type of the star is also identified. Usually, A stars are not followed up, because they rotate fast, therefore their spectral lines broaden because of the Doppler shift, making them unsuitable to detect RV variations due to low-mass planets. However, evolved A stars eventually spin down, making them suitable targets.</p><p>These "retired" A stars are among the most massive known planetary hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Johnson et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Johnson et al., , 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Bowler et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Johnson et al., 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., ,b, 2011a</ref>. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the evolved stars targeted in these surveys are not as massive as originally thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Lloyd, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Schlaufman &amp; Winn, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Follow-up photometry can also be performed with a one meter class telescope.</p><p>Surveying stars looking for transits would be too expensive with such telescopes, but once there is a transit prediction, high precision photometry is valuable in measuring the shape and depth of the transit, sometimes in multiple bands, to constrain orbital parameters. In addition, the shape of the transit might provide further confirmation to the planetary nature of the system, as those exhibit transits with mostly flat bottoms, as opposed to the V-shaped transits of eclipsing binaries.</p><p>Once a planetary candidate passes these two tests with modest size telescopes, the last step is to perform radial velocity measurements. Depending on the brightness of the target and the instruments available to the research group, this might be done with telescopes with an aperture diameter starting from a few meters. The amplitude of the RV variations is determined by the planet to star mass ratio, which together with the planet size inferred from transit depth allows for constraining the planetary density.</p><p>In addition, RV data points help determine the orbital eccentricity and the argument of periastron. However, measurements are typically taken at quadrature, that is, at the predicted peak radial velocity values, because such data points will yield the best constaints on the mass ratio. Unfortunately, such observations are the least useful in determining the orbital eccentricity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.1">Lightcurve models</head><p>A central theme in exoplanetary explorations is the inability to resolve the planetary system (except for planets at large orbital separation). Usually, all information we have about the planet and the host star has to be inferred from observations without spatial resolution. Measuring the lightcurve, that is, brightness as a function of time, plays an important role in the field of exoplanets, partially because brightness measurements are less costly than spectroscopic ones.</p><p>It is important to note that even though the observer cannot resolve the transited object, a good understanding of its spatial structure is crutial for generating an accurate lightcurve model.</p><p>Since the first observation of planetary transits (HD 209458, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Henry et al., 2000</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Charbonneau et al., 2000</ref>), there has been a need for fast and accurate modeling of transit lightcurves. Speed is an important issue, because parameters of the system (radius ratio, impact parameter, etc.) can be constrained by generating a large number of model lightcurves and comparing them to the observations. A popular and robust method for exploring parameter uncertainties and correlations is Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) calculations, which require an even larger number of model evaluation.</p><p>To model a transit lightcurve, one has to calculate not only what fraction of the planet is in front of the star at any given moment, but also account for the fact that the stellar radiation is not uniform across the stellar disk. Most photons we see come from a certain distance under the stellar surface, and at the center of the star, this distance corresponds to a larger depth than closer to the limb, where we see the surface at an angle. Since the star is hotter the deeper we go under the surface, and hotter material emits more, the center of the disk will be seen to be brighter, and the limb darker. This phenomenon is called limb darkening.</p><p>A pioneering paper for lightcurve models is written by <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. They deal with the nonlinear limb darkening in the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Iprq " 1 ´ c 0 ´ c 1 ´ 1 ´ µ 1 2 ¯ ´ c 2 p1´µq´cp1´p1´µqp1´µq´p1´µq´c 3 ´ 1 ´ µ 3 2 ¯ ´ c 4 ` 1 ´ µ 2 ˘ ,</formula><p>and its special case the quadratic limb darkening, when c 1 " c 3 " 0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Claret, 2000</ref>).</p><p>Here Iprq is the intensity of the stellar disk as seen by the observer as a function of r, the distance from the center, in stellar radius units, so that 0 ď r ď 1.</p><p>The main idea in their paper is essentially a change of variables: the stellar disk can be thought of a continuous family of concentric disks with radii ranging from zero to one, each with uniform intensity distribution, superimposed. Models that require numerical integration in one dimension are more computationally expensive than analytic ones, and models that require numerical integration in two dimensions are much, much more computationally expensive. In Chapter 6, we present a one-dimensional numerical integral for transits of spotted stars, a problem for which only two-dimensional numerical integral models existed before.</p><p>Chapter 4 applies some methods and understanding from the domain of planetary transits to a different scenario: stars transiting accretion disks around supermassive black holes in galactic centers. An important difference from the usual treatment of planetary transits is that in this case, the source has a very complicated structure, so most computation time is spent on generating the image as the observer would see the accretion disk unocculted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.2">Obliquity</head><p>In our Solar System, planetary orbits are aligned with the equator of the Sun within 7 ˝ .</p><p>The angle between the orbit of an exoplanet and the equator of its host star is commonly called obliquity, and from the Solar System, one might guess that it is typically low.</p><p>The most popular method for measuring obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">(Rossiter, 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">McLaughlin, 1924)</ref>. It exploits the redshift of the receding half of the star and the blueshift of the approaching half, to infer obliquity from timeresolved spectroscopic measurements during transit. It follows from the nature of this phenomenon that it requires a large telescope for taking exposures shorter than the transit, that its sensitivity depends on the rotation rate and the inclination of the host star and the transit impact parameter, and that it in fact measures projected obliquity (that is, projected onto the sky plane).</p><p>The first observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect on a transiting exoplanet is described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Queloz et al. (2000)</ref>, who find that HD 209458 has a low projected obliquity with respect to the orbit of HD 209458b, as expected by extrapolation of the Solar System observations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4.3">Eccentricity</head><p>Measurement results of most physical parameters, like planetary radius or semi-major axis, are often given as a Gaussian posterior distribution. Even if the underlying distribution is log-normal, a normal distribution usually provides an adequate approximation as long as the relative uncertainty is small. In such cases, the result can be parametrized with a single error bar, like 10.2 ˘ 0.3. In some cases, the distribution is skewed, and characterization like 10.2 `0.4 ´0.3 is customary. However, orbital eccentricity is usually more complicated: for bound orbits, 0.0 ď e ă 1.0, so the distribution is truncated. Also, highly eccentric orbits are rare, so the distribution is usually skewed. Last, but not at least, close systems often circularize due to tidal interaction, yielding in a bimodal eccentricity distribution: e " 0.0 for a positive fraction of objects, and e ą 0.0 for the rest of them.</p><p>Since it is an important question to decide whether a planetary orbit is circular, sometimes two models are investigated: one where the orbit is restricted to be circular, and another with two extra parameters: eccentricity e and argument of periastron (observer-star-periastron angle) ω. The two models can be compared by statistical methods, for example, using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>, or calculating the Bayesian evidence (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Feroz et al., 2009</ref>).</p><p>However, occasionally only the eccentric case is analyzed, and the resulting eccentricity is quoted with a single error bar. <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Lucy &amp; Sweeney (1971)</ref> investigate this case and provide a method to estimate the posterior likelihood of a circular orbit.</p><p>When evaluating the eccentric model, there is still a need to quantify the uncertainty of eccentricity. Instead of citing the maximum likelihood value and standard deviation for e itself, a better proxy is to give the results in terms of the orbital parameters k " e cos ω and h " e sin ω ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ford, 2005</ref>). These describe the case e " 0 seamlessly, without either parameters being truncated at this limit. Such characterization has been used for planetary orbits, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bakos et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that when performing Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) calculations, this method in fact provides a biased prior for the eccentricity: in k ´ h space, each eccentricity value has a measure proportional to e. Using ?</p><p>e cos ω and ? e sin ω instead of k and h to describe e and ω result in a flat prior in e, which is preferable to one proportional to e. In the context of exoplanet orbits, this characterization has been used, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Anderson et al. (2011a)</ref>; Gillon et al.</p><p>(2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.5">Atmospheres</head><p>With insufficient data it is easy to go <ref type="bibr">wrong. Carl Sagan (1980)</ref> The first order approximation of transits assumes that the planet is a completely dark sphere. This treatment is sufficient for measuring planetary radius, impact parameter, and other characteristics based on the lightcurve of the star.</p><p>In reality, however, planets are not completely dark. They emit thermal radiation, and extinguish part of the starlight traveling through their atmosphere. We already encountered the first phenomenon when discussing direct imaging of young planets in the infrared. Just like those planets exhibit thermal radiation due to residual heat since their formation, planets on close orbits exhibit thermal radiation due to their elevated equilibrium temperature caused by the large stellar flux. Here σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, a is the orbital radius (we assume a circular orbit in this derivation), and A B is the Bond albedo that tells us what fraction of the incoming electromagnetic radiation power is reflected by the planet. The left hand side of the equation is the total electromagnetic power emitted by the star times a geometric factor that tells us what fraction of that radiation falls on the planet times a factor that tells us what fraction is absorbed. The right hand side is the total power emitted by the planet.</p><p>However, many close planets are presumably tidally locked, and in this case, it is possible that not all incoming power get redistributed over the entire planetary surface.</p><p>Therefore the dayside temperature, that is, of the side facing the star, is more elevated than the nightside temperature. See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">Perez-Becker &amp; Showman (2013)</ref> for a detailed theoretical model of heat redistribution by the atmosphere, and Cowan &amp; Agol (2011) for heat redistribution coefficient measurements based on photometric observations.</p><p>If the planet has a constant effective temperature on its entire surface, the only way to distinguish its thermal radiation from that of the star is observing the occultation of the planet by the star, also called a secondary eclipse. On the other hand, if there is a difference between the dayside and nightside temperature, that shows up as an orbital modulation of the lightcurve.</p><p>Depending on the wavelength of the observations, the thermal emission of the planet can be negligible, and the secondary eclipse depth can be dominated by the reflected light. Such observations allow direct measurement of the geometric albedo, which in turns reveals information about the atmosphere. For example, a cloud-free atmosphere is expected to have low albedo due to pressure-broadened absorption lines of neutral sodium and potassium ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">Sudarsky et al., 2000</ref>). On the other hand, high altitude clouds reflect off most incoming starlight, resulting in a high albedo value.</p><p>When performing multiband or spectroscopic observations of secondary eclipses, emission lines can also be detected (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Knutson et al., 2008</ref>).</p><p>Another exciting method for probing planetary atmospheres is transmission spectroscopy: detecting the extinction of starlight as it travels through the atmosphere, as first theoretically described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">Seager &amp; Sasselov (2000)</ref>. Since most scattering phenomena depend smoothly on wavelength, the extinction spectrum will in fact reveal absorption features, allowing us to learn about atmospheric composition. One way to think about this phenomenon is to consider that observed at a strong absorption feature, the atmosphere blocks light, therefore the planet effectively seems to be larger, resulting in a deeper transit. On the other hand, a flat transmission spectrum, like the one observed for GJ1214b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Kreidberg et al., 2014</ref>), might indicate a grey opacity source, suggesting the presence of clouds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Stellar activity</head><p>The sun comes up just about as often as it goes down, in the long run, but this doesn't make its motion random. Donald E. <ref type="bibr">Knuth (1969)</ref> An idealized transit lightcurve model might assume a spherical, homogeneously radiating star. An idealized radial velocity model might assume narrow lines emitted uniformly from the stellar surface. In reality, limb darkening results in an axisymmetric intensity profile of the stellar disk, and spectral lines are broadened by temperature and by rotation. Stellar activity, which includes flares, granulation, and starspots, further complicates the lightcurve or spectrum of the star. In the rest of this section, we focus on the effect of starspots.</p><p>Stellar activity is linked to magnetic processes. In fully convective stars or stars with a convective envelope, the magnetic field interacts with material flow close to the surface. Stronger magnetic fields can effectively block convection in areas, resulting in dark features on the surface known as spots. The best studied starspots are those on the Sun, but observations show that spots can differ greatly in their size, lifetime, latitude, and other characteristics, even on a Sun-like star like EK Draconis (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Strassmeier &amp; Rice, 1998</ref>). These observations are based on separating spots on the approaching (blueshifted) side of the star from those on the receding (redshifted) side, a technique called Doppler imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Deutsch, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b302">Vogt et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Rice et al., 1989</ref>).</p><p>Starspots rotate with the stellar surface, causing variability on the timescale of stellar rotation.

The signal-to-noise on a single pixel was between 5 and 10 for each individual exposure. ThAr lamp calibration exposures were taken every hour for wavelength calibration. A high signal-to-noise exposure was also taken of the bright radial velocity standard star HD 223311.</p><p>Spectra were reduced using tasks in the IRAF packages CCDPROC and ECHELLE.</p><p>The spectra were cross-correlated against the radial velocity standard star HD 223311 using the IRAF task FXCOR in the RV package. We used at least 20, typically 25 of the 27 orders for the cross-correlation, rejecting the bluest orders for many exposures where the signal-to-noise was too low. Each spectral order was treated separately and the mean of the velocities from the individual orders was calculated. Their standard deviations were less than 0.65 km s ´1 for each exposure.</p><p>Each night, the exposures were taken within a two hour interval, much shorter than the orbital period of the presumed companion. For detecting large radial velocity variations to rule out the possibility of an eclipsing binary, we consider the mean radial velocities per night. The standard deviations between exposures were less than 0.75 km s ´1 for each night. Stellar parameters could have been estimated only with large uncertainty based on data with such low signal-to-noise. Therefore these parameters are not calculated from the ANU 2.3 m observations.</p><p>The results of the observations taken with these three telescopes are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.1. Note that for each telescope, the radial velocity measurement uncertainty is much higher than the radial velocity variations of the Sun due to Solar System bodies.</p><p>Therefore we only calculated heliocentric radial velocities of the target. For the more accurate measurements described in the next section, we will use barycentric radial velocities instead. This accuracy, however, is enough to rule out the case of an eclipsing binary star with great certainty. The largest RV variation within an instrument was only 2 km s ´1 , much less than the orbital speed in a typical binary system. Note that the zero-point shift between instruments is as large as " 5 km s ´1 , due to the different methods used for data reduction. Also, all eighteen spectra were single-lined and spectral lines were symmetric, providing no evidence for additional stars in the system up to the precision of the measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Properties of HAT-P-27b</head><p>When comparing these parameters, we note that there is only one transiting exoplanet known that is more massive and has a smaller radius and a smaller period than HAT-P-27b: this is HAT-P-20b with 7.246 M J , 0.867 R J on a 2.875 d orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bakos et al., 2011b</ref>). This means that HAT-P-27b is less inflated than other planets of similar mass and orbital period, possibly due to a larger than average core.</p><p>Regarding eccentricity, there are 31 transiting exoplanets known under 8 M J with an orbital period within 0.5 d of that of HAT-P-27b, out of which 8 -more than a quarter of them -are thought to be eccentric. This hints that there is a possibility for the orbit of HAT-P-27b to be eccentric as well, justifying our choice not to fix eccentricity to zero in Section 2.3. Future observations of radial velocity or occultation timing would be required to determine whether the orbit is indeed eccentric.</p><p>The impact parameter of HAT-P-27b is unusually large. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">Ribas et al. (2008)</ref> pointed out, such a near grazing transit has the advantage of its depth and duration being more sensitive to the presense of further planetary companions on inclined orbits.</p><p>This makes HAT-P-27 a promising target for transit timing variation and transit duration variation studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Knutson et al. (2010)</ref> found a strong negative correlation between chromospheric activity of the host star and temperature inversion in the planetary atmosphere. However, since early type stars dominate magnitude limited surveys, cool, that is, active planetary hosts are rare. The bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref>.6 shows that HAT-P-27 is relatively active compared to known planetary hosts for which log R 1 HK has been reported, making it an exciting target for Spitzer Space Telescope to test this correlation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Correlation of planetary parameters with host star metallicity</head><p>The relation between host star metallicity (denoted as rFe{Hs ‹ for clarity, not to be confused with the assumed metal content of the planet) and planetary composition was studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Guillot et al. (2006)</ref>. A positive correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficient r " 0.78, was found between the inferred mass of the planetary core and stellar metallicity for the seven transiting exoplanets known at that time with positive inferred core mass. The idea is that planets have formed from the same cloud as their host stars, and therefore their metal content should correlate. However, it is not clear how stellar metallicity is connected to planetary metallicity, especially because a larger rocky core is likely to accrete more gas during the planet's formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Burrows et al. (2007a)</ref> also investigated this relation, based on 12 transiting exoplanets known at the time. They used an atmospheric opacity dependent core mass model to explain radius anomalies. They also found a strong correlation between host star metallicity and inferred core mass, but the correlation coefficient was not reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Enoch et al. (2011)</ref> found that there is a strong negative correlation with r " ´0.53 between rFe{Hs ‹ and R p for the 18 known transiting exoplanets below 0.6 M J , whereas this correlation is negligible for more massive planets. This can be explained by noticing that the theoretical planet models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Fortney et al. (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Bodenheimer et al. (2003)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Baraffe et al. (2008)</ref> all suggest that the radius of a planet is more sensitive to its composition for low mass planets than it is for more massive ones.   In this subsection, we examine further the correlation between host star metallicity and planetary mass or planetary radius. We use a substantially expanded sample of 30 known transiting exoplanets with masses between 0.3 M J and 0.8 M J , see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.6.</p><p>The upper limit is selected to exclude more massive planets whose radius is expected to depend less on the composition, see above. We explain the role of the lower limit and the effect of the two lowest mass planets in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.6 later.</p><p>The null hypothesis is that the host star metallicity and the selected planetar parameter are independent. The alternative hypothesis is that they are related by some underlying phenomenon. A false positive, also known as an error of the first kind, is rejection of the null hypothesis in spite of it being true. We implement three independent statistical methods to estimate the false positive probability: t-test, bootstrap technique and F -test. We denote the probability estimates by p 1 , p 2 and p 3 , respectively. This is the statistical significance of the correlation: the lower this probability is, the more confidently the null hypothesis (i.e., no correlation) can be rejected.</p><p>For the t-test, we assume that the investigated parameters have normal distribution.</p><p>For each set of data pairs, we calculate the t value from the correlation coefficient r and sample size n using the formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">t " r c n ´ 2 1 ´ r 2 .</formula><p>The conditional distribution of this variable given the null hypothesis is Student's t distribution with n ´ 2 degrees of freedom ( <ref type="bibr">Press et al., 1992, p. 640)</ref>. Then the estimate p 1 for false positive probability is determined by looking up the two-tailed probability of this distribution yielding larger absolute value that the one measured. For comparison, we also performed the t-test for the samples and parameters studied by Guillot et al.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.7.</p><p>For the sample set of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.6, we also implement the bootstrap resampling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1994)</ref>. This has the advantage that no assumption about the a priori distribution of the data is necessary. To perform bootstrap resampling, consider the data px 1 , y 1 q, px 2 , y 2 q, . . . , px n , y n q, where x i is the host star metallicity, and y i is the corresponding planetary mass or radius. Again, we would like to calculate an estimate p 2 of the probability that a sample of similar distribution, but independent parameters for each pair, has a correlation coefficient that exceeds that of our measurements in absolute value. For this, we build 10 000 000 sample sets of n pairs by drawing x and y values independently with replacements from the set of measured x and y values, respectively. The percentile rank of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient for the measured data among the random samples gives our estimates p 2 , listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.7.</p><p>Finally, we test these correlations with an additional method, the F -test (see e.g.</p><p>Lupton, 1993, p. 100). This requires that the null hypothesis (no correlation) be nested in the tested hypothesis (linear correlation), which indeed is the case. Let RSS 1 denote the residual sum of squares for the best fit of the null hypothesis, that is, the variance of y i about its mean, and RSS 2 denote the residual sum of squares of the linear fit. The no correlation model has l 1 " 1 free parameters: the mean, whereas the linear fit has</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">l 2 " 2. The conditional distribution of F " RSS 1 ´RSS 2 l 2 ´l 1 RSS 2 n´l 2</formula><p>given the null hypothesis is the F -distribution with pl 2 ´ l 1 , n ´ l 2 q degrees of freedom.</p><p>This enables us to calculate p 3 , the third estimate for the false positive probability.</p><p>The estimates p 1 , p 2 , p 3 given by the three methods are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> As for the 30 planets listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>.6, it is important to note that the correlations depend strongly on the choice of the lower mass limit. The two least massive planets in the table are WASP-21b with a mass of 0.3 M J , very low host star metallicity of´0of´0.4, and average radius of 1.07 R J ; and the dense HD 149026b with a mass of 0.368 M J , high host star metallicity of`0of`0.36, and low radius of 0.813 R J . Increasing the lower mass limit for our sample first excludes WASP-21b, which would much support the positive rFe{Hs ‹ -M p correlation with its low mass and low host star metallicity.</p><p>Further increasing the limit then excludes HD 149026b, which would much weaken it with its low mass and high host star metallicity. To have an unbiased result, outliers cannot be excluded without a justified reason, therefore we need to compare the false positive probabilities of the three nested samples. They scatter between 15% and 58%, neither supporting, nor rejecting a rFe{Hs ‹ -M p correlation.</p><p>Similarily, both WASP-21b and HD 149026b have a strong effect on the negative rFe{Hs ‹ -R p correlation, because of the extreme value of their host star metallicities. In this case, we see that the maximum of the false positive probabilities is 0.44%, therefore this correlation is statistically significant for all our choices of lower mass limits.

An advantage of HAT-P-1 as a target is its binary companion ADS 16402 A, which provides an excellent photometric reference, simplifying the usual steps in removing instrumental artifacts from HST time-series photometry. We find that without this reference star, we would need to detrend the lightcurve with the time of the exposures as well as the first three powers of HST orbital phase, and this would introduce a strong bias in the results for the albedo. However, with this reference star, we only need to detrend the data with the time of the exposures to achieve the same per-point scatter, therefore we can avoid most of the bias associated with detrending.</p><p>Our final result is a 2σ upper limit of 0.64 for the geometric albedo of HAT-P-1b between 577 and 947 nm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Observations and data analysis</head><p>The exoplanetary host star HAT-P-1 is a member of the wide binary system ADS 16402, with 11.2" projected separation at a distance of 139 pc. HAT-P-1, also known as ADS 16402 B, with V " 10.4 is only 0.4 magnitude fainter than its binary companion ADS 16402 A of the same G0V spectral type. This allows for relative (differential) photometry to mitigate the effect of systematic errors. carried out the observations, as program GO 11617. Two occultations of HAT-P1b were observed during two visits, including two orbits before and one after each occultation. Because of the brightness of the targets, spectroscopy was required to allow for reasonably long exposures. To capture both stars without very tight constraints on spacecraft orientation, we did not use a slit. <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 3</ref>.1 summerizes the details of the observations. With these settings, the largest electron count in each exposure was about half the well size, well below saturation. However, it is interesting to note that longer exposures would not have posed a problem in terms of linearity either: when STIS pixels get saturated, the excees charge bleeds into surrounding pixels with virtually no loss, and summing these pixel counts still results in a linear response ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Gilliland et al., 1999</ref>).</p><p>We identify hot pixels and exclude them from our apertures, and identify cosmic rays and substitute them by the average of the previous and next frame values. Then we perform rectangular aperture photometry on the two stars, and define an aperture in the entire length of the detector in the dispersion direction for sky background estimation.</p><p>For each exposure, we subtract the background aperture photon count from the stellar aperture photon counts, scaled by the number of pixels. These wavelength values are calculated after identifying the Hα and Na I D lines in the stellar spectra. We extract the same spectral range for the two stars within a visit to fight wavelength-dependent systematics. However, we allow for different blue end cuts between visits, otherwise we would lose too many photons in the second visit due to the more restrictive wavelength limit of the first one. We do not expect the geometric albedo to vary significantly due to this small change in blue end wavelength cut.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Detrending</head><p>The next step is to detrend the data, that is, to mitigate instrumental effects by subtracting multiples of vectors describing circumstances of the observations. We (reference flux and planet-to-star flux ratio) as well as detrending vector coefficients using a linear algebraic least square method. We actually use the magnitude of HAT-P-1 or the magnitude difference of the two stars, that is, we assume that instrumental effects are multiplicative. Since both the planet-to-star flux ratio and detrending corrections are very small, this is equivalent to assuming additive effects and fitting for the flux or flux ratio. Each detrending vector is mean subtracted so that they do not change the average stellar magnitude. To quantify the effect of detrending and avoid overfitting, we minimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is the sum of χ 2 and a term penalizing extra model parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">(Schwarz, 1978)</ref>.</p><p>When analyzing STIS data to perform photometry on exoplanetary host stars, Indeed, if we only consider the lightcurve of HAT-P-1, we find the lowest BIC when detrending with time at mid-exposure and the first three powers of HST orbital phase.</p><p>However, if we divide the lightcurve of the planetary host by that of the reference star ADS 16402 A, we find the lowest BIC when detrending only with mid-exposure time.</p><p>This shows that relative photometry is less sensitive to systematics, and can mitigate HST orbital effects enough that detrending with orbital phase is not justified. The</p><p>Bayesian Information Criterion does not justify detrending with the temperature, focus, or jitter vectors in either case. on panels (g, h) do not exhibit such large variations, and we only need to remove the linear trend (panels i, j). These panels all have logaritmic vertical axes with the same scaling, so that relative scatter is directly comparable. Note that since we perform a simultaneous fit of the occultation lightcurve and detrending vectors, the resulting χ 2 tells us how close the data are to a model accounting for both the occultation and systematics, without the danger of misinterpreting the occultation as scatter.</p><p>The strength of these observations is the presence of the reference star, which already proves to be advantageous. In order to quantify how much it improves the albedo limits,</p><p>we perform a full analysis both without and with this reference data, independently tuning all extraction parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Aperture parameters and data omission</head><p>If we only extract the flux of HAT-P-1, we find that we obtain the least scatter after detrending (with mid-exposure time and first three powers of HST orbital phase) if the stellar apertures are 14 and 16 pixels wide in cross-dispersion direction for the two visits, respectively, and the stellar spectra are cut off at 788 nm. Redward of this wavelength there is extra scatter due to fringing, which is difficult to combat in slitless mode. If we use the flux ratio of the two stars, we get the least scatter after detrending (this time with mid-exposure time only) if the stellar apertures are 16 and 18 pixels wide in cross-dispersion direction for the two visits respectively, and the stellar spectra are cut off further in the near infrared at 947 nm. Using the reference star thus allows us to extract photons from a larger aperture. The optimal background aperture is 27 pixels wide for the first visit and 22 for the second in both cases.</p><p>We estimate sky background using an aperture placed as far from the stellar spectra as possible, to avoid contamination by starlight. Varying the background aperture width by a few tens of pixels introduces scatter of 0.02 in the best fit albedo as long as the aperture is not too narrow and not too close to the stars either. Given the other uncertainty sources discussed in Section 3.3.2, this means that the results are practically insensitive to the exact choice of the background aperture. However, if we place the background aperture between the two spectra on the detector, or expand it on the side to get within 50 pixels of HAT-P-1, we find a larger average error, of 0.05, in the geometric albedo due to stray starlight.</p><p>Finally, we investigate whether it is justified to omit data points. Note that the data analysis parameter space has many dimensions: stellar and background aperture geometry, data omission, and choice of detrending parameters.</p><p>The choices presented above were found after multiple iterations, and they yield the minimum residual sum of squares in each dimension, but strictly speaking, they might not represent the global minimum.

Note, however, that we can never observe the theoretical maximum flux F p from the planet, because opposition happens during occultation (therefore f is always smaller than one). We derive the following model for f :</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d " b R 2 ‹ b 2 ` a 2 sin 2 pφ´φpφ´pφ´φ 0 q u " arccos d 2 ` R 2 ‹ ´ R 2 p 2dR ‹ , v " arccos d 2 ` R 2 p ´ R 2 ‹ 2dR p f " $ ' ' ' ' ' ' &amp; ' ' ' ' ' ' % 0 if dďR‹´Rp (occultation), maxˆ1`b maxˆ maxˆ1` maxˆ1`b 1´d1´d 2 a 2 2 ´ ` u π ´ sin 2u 2π ˘ R 2 ‹ R 2 p ´ ` v π ´ sin 2v 2π ˘ , 0 ˙ if R‹´RpădďR‹`Rp (ingress and egress), 1` b 1´d1´d 2 a 2 2</formula><p>if R‹`Rpăd (out of occultation).</p></div>

This introduces a small error which only affects a few data points. Note, however, that there are other sources of error: when determining the terminator line, we assume that the planet is irradiated by parallel rays from the direction of the center of the star, instead of properly calculating irradiation in the belt from where the star is partially seen on the horizon of the planet. Also, we do not account for that the substellar point is closer to the star, therefore it is exposed to more irradiation. These errors are in the order of R 2 ‹ a 2 « 0.01, that is, they bias our geometric albedo estimate by the order of 1%.</p><p>We assume Lambertian reflectance of the incident light. Note that the maximum angle of stellar irradiance on the planet to the line of sight during our science exposures used in the final analysis is « 11 ˝ . In case of reflection from materials like regolith, this would be very different from reflection in opposition, but we expect the reflected flux for a gas giant like HAT-P-1b to depend only weakly on the incident angle.</p><p>Using this model lightcurve, we then fit simultaneously for the planet to star flux ratio at opposition and the coefficients of the detrending vectors. Then the geometric albedo can be calculated using the expression (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Rowe et al., 2008</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">A g " F p F ‹ a 2 R 2 p .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Uncertainty sources</head><p>There are two sources of errors in the inferred geometric albedo: observational errors and contribution of parametric uncertainties of the system. We estimate the total observational uncertainty u obs by bootstrapping. Since instrument parameters like temperature might not have a normal distrubtion or might not influence the data in a linear fashion, we cannot assume that the error distribution is normal. Therefore we apply the bias corrected accelerated bootstrap method <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Efron, 1987)</ref>, a generalized bootstrap algorithm that partially corrects for effects due to non-normal error distributions.</p><p>The total observational uncertainty is due to photon noise and other uncertainties due to instrument thermal instability, pointing jitter, and stellar activity in both stars.</p><p>(Quantization noise due to the gain set to 4 can be neglected.) We estimate the uncertainty u photon due to photon noise by independently redrawing every data point (HAT-P-1, reference star, and background for each exposure) from a Poisson distribution with a parameter given by the original photon count, and recalculating the geometric albedo. Finally, we get the estimate of the uncertainty u other due to other sources by subtracting the photon noise estimate from the total observational uncertainty estimate in quadrature.</p><p>When quantifying the uncertainty contributions of the planetary system parameters, we divide them into two groups: ephemeris (mid-transit time and period), and geometry (planetary radius and orbital semi-major axis relative to the stellar radius, and impact parameter). This division is important for two reasons: first, the two visits took place 1181 and 1525 days after the reference mid-transit ephemeris of Johnson et al.</p><p>(2008b), respectively, therefore we expect that the second visit will suffer more from the uncertainty in mid-occultation time. Second, it is easier to refine the ephemeris by photometric follow-up transit observations than to refine the geometric parameters, so we want to assess how much this would improve the results. Note that geometric parameters not only influence the occultation lightcurve shape that we use for fitting, but also factor in when converting the planet-to-star flux ratio to geometric albedo.</p><p>We estimate the uncertainties u ephem in the geometric albedo due to uncertainties in ephemeris, u geom due to those in geometric parameters, and their total contribution u param due to all parametric uncertainties by redrawing the respective parameters from independent normal distributions defined by their best fit values and uncertainties, and recalculating the geometric albedo in each case. We confirm that u ephem and u geom add up in quadrature to u param . We use 1 000 000 bootstrap iterations to estimate the observational uncertainty u obs , and 1 000 000 random drawings to estimate each of u photon , u ephem , u geom , and u param .</p><p>Finally, we add the observational and parametric uncertainty estimates in quadrature to estimate the total uncertainty u total , and add this to the best fit geometric albedo to calculate the upper limits. The breakdown of uncertainty sources is represented in a tree structure in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 3.2 and 3</ref>.3: the upper limit is the sum of its children nodes best fit and total uncertainty, and uncertainties are quadrature sums of their children nodes.</p><p>We find that most lower albedo limits of the final analysis are negative, therefore we only present upper limits for the geometric albedo. The 1σ and 2σ upper limits are determined so that the probability of the geometric albedo being smaller than this is 0.6827 and 0.9545, respectively. As a comparison, the one-sided 1σ and 2σ upper limits of a normal distribution occur at 0.475σ and 1.690σ above the mean, respectively, and we expect our corresponding uncertainties to have a similar ratio. By comparing the different contributions to the uncertainty of the geometric albedo, we see that the observational uncertainties are much larger than the parametric ones.</p><p>This means that performing further photometric observations of occultations could significantly improve the albedo upper limit, whereas using additional transit observations to refine the ephemeris and geometric parameters and use them to reanalyze these data would not. As for the observational uncertainties, residual systematic uncertainty u other  and photon noise contribution u photon are within a factor of two, which tells us that further improving our data analysis could push the upper albedo limits down only by a small amount. Surprisingly, we do not always find u ephem to be larger for the second visit than for the first, but we confirm that 1σ and 2σ uncertainties of each kind have a ratio close to what is expected for a normal distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Discussion and summary</head><p>Based on HST STIS observations, we established 0.24 as the 1σ, and 0.64 as the 2σ upper limit for the geometric albedo of HAT-P-1b in the 557-947 nm band. Unfortunately, this limit is not tight enough to determine whether there is temperature inversion in the atmosphere. This question is relevant because HAT-P-1b has an equilibrium temperature between that of HD 209458b (thought to exhibit temperature inversion)</p><p>and HD 189733b (thought not to). In addition, a better constrained albedo would provide information about the actual atmospheric temperature of the planet, as well as indicate the presence or absence of reflective clouds or high-altitude haze.</p><p>Our data analysis demonstrates that the reference star ADS 16402 A helps us greatly to reduce systematic effects. Even though detrending with powers of HST orbital phase would equally reduce scatter in the signal (just like demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Brown et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Knutson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">Sing et al., 2011</ref>), we find that it introduces a bias in the geometric albedo estimate. We attribute this effect to the fact that these detrending vectors are not orthogonal to the occultation signal. Most of this bias can be avoided by performing relative photometry, so that much less detrending is necessary to mitigate systematic effects. This is possible because ADS 16402 A has a similar brightness and same spectral type as HAT-P-1, and their angular distance is small enough so that they fit in the STIS field of view, but large enough so that their PSFs do not overlap.</p><p>We found that the uncertainties of the system parameters have a negligible effect on the geometric albedo uncertainty. The dominant uncertainty sources are photon noise and other noise effects (thermal instability, pointing jitter, other systematics, and astrophysical noise of the two stars), the contributions of which scale inversely with the square root of the number of observations. This also means that additional observations would improve the upper limit, without being too limited by how precisely we know the geometry and ephemeris of the planetary system. larger planet-to-flux ratio than in case of HAT-P-1b for the same geometric albedo, and its zero-albedo equilibrium temperature T eq " 1300 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">Torres et al., 2008)</ref>, similar to that of HAT-P-1b, would make such a measurement interesting in terms of atmospheric models.</p><p>Acknowledgements  properties of stellar cusps, we find that around 10 6 solar mass SMBHs, transits of red giants are most common for stars on close orbits with transit durations of a few weeks and orbital periods of a few years. We find that detecting AGN transits requires repeated observations of thousands of low mass AGNs to 1% photometric accuracy in optical, or " 10% in UV bands or soft X-ray. It may be possible to identify stellar transits in the Pan-STARRS and LSST optical and the eROSITA X-ray surveys. Such observations could be used to constrain black hole mass, spin, inclination and accretion rate. Transit rates and durations could give valuable information on the circumnuclear stellar clusters as well. Transit lightcurves could be used to image accretion disks with unprecedented resolution, allowing to resolve the SMBH silhouette in distant AGNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Introduction</head><p>Photometric transits have been successfully used to identify and characterize transiting extrasolar planets since the discovery of the first one, HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Charbonneau et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Henry et al., 2000</ref>). Transit shape is a telltale of planetary, orbital, and stellar parameters. Moreover, the apparent time-dependent redshift of the star due to the planet covering its receding or approaching side during transit can reveal the projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotational axis (Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">Rossiter, 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">McLaughlin, 1924)</ref>. These methods show that transits are very powerful in probing planetary systems.</p><p>Similarly, active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks can be probed by observing occultations in X-ray due to broad line region clouds: optically thick clouds orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the region from where broad emission lines of the AGN are thought to originate. These occultations have a large covering factor of " 0.1 to 1 (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">McKernan &amp; Yaqoob, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Turner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bianchi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Maiolino et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Risaliti et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Risaliti et al., , 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr">Risaliti et al., ,b, 2011b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Risaliti et al.

There are multiple coincidences that make it possible to detect such events:</p><p>the radius of large stars is comparable to the characteristic size of an accretion disk around a 10 6 M d SMBH, resulting in transits deep enough to detect. The orbital period is a few years in the innermost regions where the stellar number density is highest, short enough for repeated observations. Finally, the typical transit duration for these innermost stars is an hour to a few weeks (depending on the stellar population and the observing band), which is longer than the typical cadence required to observe AGNs, but still accessible on human timescales.</p><p>In order to produce a detectable signature in the lightcurve, the transiting object In this paper, we calculate transit depths, durations, periods, rates, and instantaneous probabilities based on physical models of nuclear stellar clusters. We also present simulated transit lightcurves and transit depth maps in multiple frequency bands. The shape of the lightcurve depends on the observing wavelength, the mass and spin of the SMBH, the accretion rate, the inclination of the accretion disk, the projected position of the transit chord, and the orbital velocity of the transiting object.</p><p>Therefore observations with sufficient photometric accuracy and time resolution allow us to constrain these parameters, and to test the employed accretion and general relativity models.</p><p>In Section 4.2, we review observations of large stars closely orbiting Sgr A*, the SMBH at the center of the Galaxy ( §4. </p></div>

Its relevant instrument is the High Resolution Camera (HRC) has a 31 arcmin by 31 arcmin field of view, sensitive from 0.1 keV to 10 keV ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">Weisskopf et al., 2002</ref>). The Spektr-RG satellite is scheduled to launch in 2013 at earliest. Its eROSITA X-ray telescope system has approximately twice the effective area of a single instrument on XMM-Newton below 2 keV ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Predehl et al., 2010)</ref>. This observatory is planned to carry out a survey consisting of eight full scans of the sky in four years, with a mean total exposure time of 2 ks for each region ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Merloni et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>The Extreme Physics Explorer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Garcia et al., 2011</ref>) is a mission concept designed specifically to study accretion disks around SMBHs. It is proposed to have more than an order of magnitude larger effective area than current missions, thus capable of observing targets farther away.</p><p>As an example, we estimate the expected number of transits detected during a single 100 ks observing campaign with the HRC-I instrument on Chandra. We consider observations in the energy range 0.1 keV to 0.4 keV, logarithmically centered on the energy 0.2 keV for which we calculated transit probabilities. Based on Section 4.3.1, the integrated luminosity in this range is 9 ˆ 10 41 erg{s, 8 ˆ 10 42 erg{s, and 6 ˆ 10 43 erg{s, and the photon index is´0is´0.2, 0.4, and 1.6, for AGNs with a " 0.9 and mass 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 M d , respectively. (Accretion disks around non-spinning black holes are up to a factor of four less luminous in this energy range.) Let us divide the observation time into ten bins of 10 ks each for temporal resolution.</p><p>If we want the relative photon noise to be 0.1 in each bin, we need a count rate of at least 0.01 photons per second. According to the PIMMS count rate calculator 4 , this is the case up to a luminosity distance of « 290, 890, and 2 300 Mpc for SMBH masses of 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 M d , respectively. This corresponds to a redshift z « 0.06, 0.2, and 0.4, which is small enough to neglect in terms of flux change for a simple estimate. There are « 40, « 12 000, and « 180 000 AGNs in the corresponding mass ranges, out to this luminosity distance, out of which « 0.0003, « 0.08, and « 1 fall in the Chandra field of view on average. Therefore we can only observe a single or at most a few targets in one pointing. Since the probability of detecting a transit when observing a single target for this much time is negligible based on the transit rate value of reach the depth of 0.1, therefore they are not likely to be detected in the inherent variability. If we assume a b " 0.01 mass fraction of giant stars in a typical AGN, we expect approximately " 10´310´3 , 0.1, and 10 transits of depth " 1, " 1, and 0.1 detected for SMBH masses " 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 M d , respectively.</p><p>We conclude that discovering stellar transits in X-ray with proposal instruments is unlikely, whereas it may be possible with survey instruments like eROSITA for AGNs with 10 6 -10 7 M d .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Discussion</head><p>In this section we highlight the uncertain points in our argument, not only to be able to properly interpret our predictions, but also to understand the implications of future AGN transit detections or non-detections.</p><p>We based our stellar models in galactic nuclei on observations of the center of the Galaxy in §4.2, assuming that this is a good representation of circumnuclear star clusters in active galaxies, and on theoretical dynamical models. We set up simplified stellar population models to estimate transit rates. Our estimates of transit probabilities depend strongly on the assumed value of the stellar distribution exponent α: the 1000 α´2 terms in Equations (4.18)-(4.22) are due to the three order of magnitude difference in the distance scales of r min and r 0 . As a consequence, steeper stellar distributions feature larger transit probabilities, consistent with the statement that most probabilistic measures are dominated by closeby stars for moderate values of α.</p><p>Evaluated at α " 3, Equation (4.3) and thus Equations (4.18-4.22) yield zero. This artifact originates in the assumption that the number of stars within r min is negligible, which is not true for this value of α. To study the case of α « 3, we recalculate 9 N without this assumption: would potentially cause detectable transits.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">9 N " b 0.093 yr 3 ´ α α ´ 1 2 M 5 2 6 ˆ M ‹ 30 M d ˙ ´1ˆ( ´1ˆ ´1ˆ(4.23) ˆ r 3´α min r 3´α i ´ r 3´α minˆr minˆminˆr min 1 mpc ˙ ´ 5 2 ˆ R AGN 10 R g ˙ .</formula><p>At large orbital radii, we expect microlensing to dominate over the light obscuration due to the transiting star. We did not investigate this phenomenon in detail but conservatively ignored all transits due to stars on wide orbits where microlensing may become significant. As the transit rate is dominated by closeby stars, microlensing is not a limiting factor of transit observability after all. Also, we did not account for apsidal and Lense-Thirring precession, which may move stars in and out of transiting orbits.</p><p>AGN transits due to broad line clouds are expected to be much more frequent than the stellar transits calculated here (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">McKernan &amp; Yaqoob, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Bianchi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Maiolino et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Risaliti et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Risaliti et al., , 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr">Risaliti et al., ,b, 2011b</ref>. Transits of clouds may be somewhat different than stellar transits due to their cometary shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Maiolino et al., 2010)</ref>, and typically have a shorter duration due to their proximity to the SMBH and larger velocity (typically ∆t " 1 hr M 6 if orbiting at r BLR " 1000 R g ).</p><p>Note that we have assumed that the transiting stars move on orbits much wider than the accretion disk. This assumption may be violated for stars on very close orbits (r À 10 5 R g " M 6 4.8 mpc), where stars crossing the disk may get captured by hydrodynamic drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Karas &amp; ˇ Subr, 2001</ref>).</p><p>We mentioned the possibility of supermassive stars possibly forming in AGN accretion disks, but do not have information on their occurrence rates. Furthermore, Wolf-Rayet stars exhibit strong stellar winds, which might form an optically thick region of radius " 100 R d ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref> in Crowther, 2007, and references therein); OH/IR stars can form dust clouds much larger than the entire accretion disk (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bedijn, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Kemper et al., 2002</ref>); and bloated stars with large irradiated envelopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Edwards, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Penston, 1988)</ref> may be present near the AGN. These objects can potentially cause much deeper transits or even eclipses.</p><p>In Section 4.3.1, we investigated the projected thermal radiation structure of an accretion disk with specific parameters, assuming radiatively efficient accretion, modeling radiative transfer in the accretion disk photosphere, and accounting for light propagation in the Kerr metric of the SMBH. We set the Eddington ratio to 0.25, a value based on the analyses of <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Kollmeier et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Shankar et al. (2012)</ref>. This value is consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Greene &amp; Ho (2007)</ref>. However, keep in mind that magnitude limited samples are biased towards larger Eddington ratios. Also note that the Eddington ratio can in fact vary by an order of magnitude in either direction (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Kauffmann &amp; Heckman, 2009)</ref>. A larger accretion rate would increase the total luminosity and the peak frequency with little effect on the size of the accretion disk. Therefore such a disk would be much brighter in X-ray than one with lower Eddington ratio, while they would exhibit transits of similar depth.</p><p>We also assumed prograde disk alignment for spinning SMBHs, but noted that the transit probabilities do not depend strongly on spin.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we presented simple estimates to study the prospects for detecting stellar AGN transits. We have shown that such observations would offer a novel possibility to image the accretion disk in distant AGN with unprecedented accuracy. For example, the black hole silhouette (i.e., the lack of emission within the ISCO) may be resolved using the lightcurve of an AGN transit due to an O-type main sequence star. These observations probe the accretion disk and the space-time geometry around black holes, and in particular, they are sensitive to the black hole spin. AGN stellar transit event rates offer information about the circumnuclear stellar cluster.</p><p>We predict that the Pan-STARRS survey could detect 10 " 20 stellar transits, and LSST may detect " 100 by repeated photometric observations of " 10 6 M d AGNs. We estimate that stellar transit detections in X-rays are not likely with individual campaigns on proposal instruments, but we expect a few possible detections in " 10 7 M d AGNs with X-ray surveys like eROSITA. Note that these rate estimates do not include transits by Compton thick clouds, which are observed to be common in X-rays. The transit rate corresponding to clouds could also be much more frequent in optical surveys.</p><p>However, these probability estimates are very sensitive to parameters which are based on theoretical arguments. One of these parameters is the inner radius cutoff of the nuclear stellar cluster, r min , which is set by stellar collisions. We have shown that if stellar collisions did not deplete the innermost regions, the less stringent limitation due to tidal disruption would imply " 200 times larger transit rates for O stars. Such scenarios may be possible if the effective stellar size increases during close approach to the AGN, leading to large irradiated envelopes ("bloated stars", see <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Edwards, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Penston, 1988)</ref>. AGN transit observations could constrain these parameters and refine circumnuclear stellar population models in distant galaxies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>A number of planet host stars have been observed to rotate with a period equal to an integer multiple of the orbital period of their close planet. We expand this list by analyzing Kepler data of HAT-P-11 and finding a period ratio of 6:1. In particular, we present evidence for a long-lived spot on the stellar surface that is eclipsed by the planet in the same position four times, every sixth transit. We also identify minima in the out-of-transit lightcurve and confirm that their phase with respect to the stellar rotation is mostly stationary for the 48 month time frame of the observations, confirming the proposed rotation period. For comparison, we apply our methods to <ref type="bibr">Kepler-17 and</ref> confirm the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bonomo &amp; Lanza (2012)</ref> that the period ratio is not exactly 8:1</p><p>in that system. Finally, we provide a hypothesis on how interactions between a star and its planet could possibly result in an observed commensurability for systems where the stellar differential rotation profile happens to include a period at some latitude that is commensurable to the planetary orbit. However, frequency analysis is not the only method suitable for measuring rotation rates of spots on the stellar surface. A transiting planet may eclipse spots on the surface of its host star, resulting in anomalies in the transit lightcurve. This phenomenon was observed, for example, in the systems HD 209458 <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">(Silva, 2003)</ref>, HD 189733 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Pont et al., 2007</ref>), TReS-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Rabus et al., 2009)</ref>, and CoRoT-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Lanza et al., 2009a</ref>). Repeated transit anomaly detections due to the same spot can be used to constrain the stellar rotation period. This method was first applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Silva-Valio (2008)</ref> to HD 209458.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Introduction</head><p>Another application of starspot-induced transit anomalies is to constrain the spinorbit geometry, as was first mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Winn et al. (2010b)</ref>. This method was independently identify two active latitudes (where spots are most prevalent) on the surface of the star, which they assume to be symmetrical around the equator, to conclude that HAT-P-11b is on a nearly polar orbit in accordance with the spectroscopic results, and that the stellar spin axis of HAT-P-11 is close to being in the plane of sky.</p><p>The transit lightcurve of Kepler-17b (P " 1.49 days) also exhibits anomalies due to spots on the surface of its host star. In their discovery paper, <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2011)</ref> analyze these anomalies to study both stellar rotation and orbital geometry. They observe that the transit anomaly pattern repeats every eighth planetary orbit, suggesting that the spots rotate once while the planet orbits eight times. They dub the phenomenon of the same spots reappearing periodically at the same phase in transit lightcurves-every eighth one in this case-the stroboscopic effect. As for the orbital geometry, they found that transit anomalies in successive orbits are consistent with being caused by the same spots that rotate one eighth of a full revolution on the stellar surface with each orbit of the planet. This implies a low projected obliquity of the planetary orbit, and also excludes frequency aliases (like the star rotating three or five times while the planet orbits eight times).</p><p>In this paper, we present evidence for a 6:1 period commensurability between the rotation of the star HAT-P-11 and the orbit of its planet HAT-P-11b (P "</p><p>4.89 days; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al., 2010</ref>). The increasing number of systems known to exhibit such commensurability raises the question of whether this is the result of an interaction between the planet and the star.</p><p>Whenever studying stellar rotation, it is important to remember that stars with convective zones exhibit differential rotation. In this paper, the working definition of stellar rotation rate is that inferred through dominant spots on the stellar surface, either from the rotational modulation of the out-of-transit lightcurve or from transit anomalies. This way we measure the rotation rate of the stellar surface at the latitude of the spots or active regions. If spots from multiple latitudes with different rotational rates contribute significantly to the lightcurve, then we expect the inferred posterior distribution of the rotational period to have a broader profile.</p><p>Despite their usefulness in confining planetary obliquity and mapping spots, transit anomalies due to the planet eclipsing spots can also be a nuisance: they contaminate the transit lightcurve, introducing biases in the detected transit depth (Czesla et al., the best-fit spot parameters into the rotational modulation model macula <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Kipping, 2012)</ref> and compare the resulting model lightcurve to observations. In Section 5.5, we perform a statistical analysis of spot-induced anomalies in the transits of HAT-P-11b</p><p>and Kepler-17b. In Section 5.6, we look for the periodicity of lightcurve minima for both stars. We show evidence for two spots or spot groups at opposite longitudes on both HAT-P-11 and Kepler-17 and find that on the former, they seem to alternate in relative activity level, which is known as the "flip-flop" phenomenon ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Jetsu et al., 1991</ref>). In Section 5.7, we calculate the probability of commensurate periods by chance.</p><p>In Section 5.8, we state one possible hypothesis about stellar rotation-planetary orbit resonance and discuss difficulties in proving it. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 5.9. (as done, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aigrain et al., 2008)</ref>, the resulting range is consistent with the proposed rotational periods for both stars. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">McQuillan et al. (2013)</ref> for a discussion of using the autocorrelation function as a complementary method to periodograms for studying stellar rotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Out-of-transit lightcurve</head><p>Note that Kepler data are dense in time, with long runs of almost continuous observations. We confirm that the spectral window function does not have large values at periods above 30 minutes, the cadence of observations. Therefore unlike for sparsely sampled ground based observations, frequency aliasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Dawson &amp; Fabrycky, 2010)</ref> does not pose a problem in this analysis.</p><p>The periodograms rule out that we are dealing with an alias of the rotational rate.</p><p>However, the narrow periodogram peak is located at a period slightly larger than the proposed rotational period for both stars. <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">McQuillan et al. (2013)</ref> observe that spot evolution and differential rotation can cause periodogram peaks to split up into multiple narrow peaks, thus the FWHM may not correspond directly to the period uncertainty.</p><p>Therefore, the periodograms are not inconsistent with the proposed rotational periods of 29.33 days for HAT-P-11 and 12.01 days for Kepler-17.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Stroboscopic effect on HAT-P-11</head><p>Winn et al. (2010b) were the first to note that the ratio between the stellar rotation period of HAT-P-11 and the orbital period of HAT-P-11b is approximately 6:1. If it was close enough to 6:1 and there were spots that lived long enough, then one would be able to detect multiple lightcurve anomalies because of the same spot every sixth transit. However, HAT-P-11b has a polar orbit with respect to the stellar spin axis;</p><p>therefore, if the periods were incommensurable, then the spot could not fall repeatedly under the transit chord.</p><p>Sanchis-Ojeda &amp; Winn (2011) pointed out that a 6:1 period ratio is a priori unlikely.</p><p>They were looking for recurrence of transit anomalies, but quarters 0, 1, and 2 of Kepler data available at the time did not provide a large enough sample for such investigations.</p><p>In this section, we study a single extraordinary example of spot recurrence observed by the Kepler space telescope on HAT-P-11, presented on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.3. Lightcurves of transits 217, 223, 229, and 235 exhibit very similarly shaped spot-induced anomalies.</p><p>The striking similarity between these four anomalies, spaced apart by six planetary orbits, suggests that they are caused by the same spot, which evolves little during these observations. If this is indeed the case, then we are seeing the same stroboscopic effect However, the same transit anomaly might be caused by a continuous active band encircling the star along a constant latitude. In this case, the anomaly shape would not depend on how much the star rotates between each six transits and thus would provide no information on a possible commensurability. To exclude this possibility, we look at all transits surrounding the ones highlighted on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.3. We subtract the model transit lightcurve without spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Mandel &amp; Agol, 2002</ref>) from the observed data and plot the residuals for each transit on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.4.</p><p>We look for anomalies in adjacent transits that are similar to the one seen on Therefore we can exclude the case of a continuous dark band around the star, because such a band would cause transit anomalies of comparable amplitude at the same phase in every single transit.</p><p>Note, however, that it is not possible to determine the exact shape of the spots  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.3: Transit anomalies providing evidence for the 6:1 commensurability. The transits, from top to bottom, are separated by six planetary orbits, which is the proposed stellar rotation period. Left panels show detrended Kepler short cadence photometry, along with best-fit model lightcurve with single spot. Right panels show the projected stellar disk, transit chord, and best-fit spot. Note that spot seems to be stationary over this time period, which suggests a tight 6:1 commensurability.</p><p>based on transit anomalies that only scan the star along sparse transit chords, therefore the determination of stellar rotation period hinges on the assumed shape of the spots, circular in our case. If, on the other hand, the spots were elongated in longitude, then the shape of the transit anomaly would not be sensitive to the stellar rotation rate, therefore the stroboscopic effect could be observed even for incommensurable periods.</p><p>Also note that there are signs of other spots evolving on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.4, for example, between transits 225 (one small spot), 231 (now split into two), and 237 (disappeared), that are also separated by one stellar rotation each.</p><p>For our analysis, we adopt the revised transit ephemeris, planetary radius and orbital semimajor axis relative to the stellar radius, orbital inclination, and limb darkening parameters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Deming et al. (2011)</ref>. Their analysis accounts for eclipsed and uneclipsed spots and relies on the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron measurement of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref> that uses both RV data and Hipparcos parallax for HAT-P-11. To normalize each transit, we divide short cadence data by a linear fit to the out-of-transit observation within 0.12 days from the mid-transit time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Comparison to out-of-transit lightcurve</head><p>When analyzing the lightcurve periodicity to find the stellar rotation rate, we assumed that the lightcurve is dominated by rotational modulation of spots (as opposed to, for example, stellar pulsation). As <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al. (2010)</ref> noted, the rotational modulation amplitude is indeed consistent with expectations based on observations of other K dwarfs. In this section, we offer an independent method to confirm this hypothesis: we first identify a number of spots via transit anomalies, then we model the rotational modulation caused by these spots and compare it to the observed lightcurve.</p><p>We adopt the analysis of   transits in the Kepler dataset, and run MCMC analysis to explore the spot parameters.</p><p>The model they use assumes the same quadratic limb darkening law for spots and the rest of the photosphere. It also assumes that spots are circular on the surface of the star, that is, elliptical in projection.</p><p>The best-fitting lightcurves for transits 217, 223, 229, and 235 are shown on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure   5</ref>.3, involving a single independent spot for each transit. The strikingly similar best-fit position of the spot as shown on the right panels further supports the hypothesis of stellar rotation-planetary orbit commensurability. We also highlight data points that are considered to be part of a spot anomaly according to the best-fit model in red on We feed the parameters of the spots derived from the transit anomalies into the rotational modulation model macula <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Kipping, 2012)</ref>. Since a long-lived stationary spot would be detected each stellar rotation (like the spot appearing in multiple transits above), we model each detected spot as if it lived for a single stellar rotation only, coming to life on the far side of the star half a rotation before we detect the transit anomaly it causes and ceasing to exist half a stellar rotation later, also on the far side.</p><p>Since we see HAT-P-11 almost equator-on ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Winn et al., 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Hirano et al., 2011)</ref>, every spot we model gets to the far side of the star half a stellar rotation after it is eclipsed by the planet. If the same spot causes another transit anomaly one stellar rotation later, we model it as a separate spot that is created when the first one dies. This is the simplest way of treating spot evolution: properties of a long-lived spot are described by piecewise constant functions, with the jumps happening when the spot is not in sight, resulting in a continuous model lightcurve. In this treatment, we do not have to investigate whether two transit anomalies separated by an integer number of stellar rotations are due to the same spot or different spots, since we treat them as separate spots in both cases.  It is important to remember that this is not a fit for the out-of-transit lightcurve but rather a model lightcurve using spot parameters inferred from a different phenomenon as input. We see that the model is a fair match to the observations in terms of qualitative features. In particular, the deepest lightcurve minima are corretly predicted to occur after the transits drawn in blue on the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.5. Projected obliquities of 90 ˝ and 270 ˝ , both corresponding to a polar orbit, can be distinguised by the time of lightcurve minima, which would occur after or before the transit with the spot anomaly, respectively. Our lightcurve analysis thus confirms the projected obliquity measurements based on the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.</p><p>However, the observed flux variations have an amplitude approximately two to six times larger than that of our model. It is likely that there are spots on the stellar surface that are never transited by the planet; therefore, this model does not account for them. Such spots could contribute to the deeper minima in the observations, explaining the amplitude discrepancy.</p><p>For reference, the times of the four transits from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.3 are also indicated on the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.5 with blue vertical lines. Dark spots simultaneously increase transit depth and decrease the total brightness of the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Czesla et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Deming et al., 2011</ref>). Therefore we expect a negative correlation between these two quantities. Note, however, that the variation in out-oftransit brightness and thus in transit depth is in the order of one percent, therefore the expected change of brightness during transit is a factor of few smaller than the noise of individual short cadence photometric data points.</p><p>To investigate this correlation, we calculate the out-of-transit brightness of HAT-P-11</p><p>at the middle of each of the 204 transits by dividing the linear fit to short cadence out-of-transit data by mean intensity across the entire quarter. We remove all data points that are affected by transit anomalies according to the best fit model, and fit a single transit depth scaling factor to the remaining data points, using a nominal</p><p>Mandel-Agol lightcurve.</p><p>We find a Pearson correlation coefficient of r " ´0.20 between out-of-transit intensity and transit depth, which does not indicate significant correlation. In addition to the small expected variation of transit depth, we attribute this negative result to eclipsed spots that we do not identify during transits. Note that an uneclipsed spot increases the transit depth, whereas an eclipsed one, when not accounted for, results in a shallower transit fit: a bias in the opposite sense. This potentially hinders the study of the correlation between out-of-transit brightness and transit depth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b287">Szabó et al. (2014)</ref> apply the method of hierarchical clustering to look for recurrence of spot anomalies in Kepler-13b transits, and they find a periodicity of three orbits with a high statistical significance. This implies that after three orbits, the planet rescans the same part of the stellar surface, supporting their hypothesis that an integer number of stellar rotations (five in this case) takes place during this time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Spot recurrence</head><p>We aim to perform a statistical analysis of the same phenomenon on HAT-P-11 in this section, using a different approach. To analyze similarities between transits, we devise the following method: first, we calculate the deviation of the normalized transit lightcurves from the spotless model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>. Then we run a moving boxcar average of seven data points to decrease independent noise in the data. After that, we set a threshold and flag transits with data points above it as anomalous. The next step is to pick a period and count pairs of observed transits that are spaced apart by this period. Finally, we plot the ratio of the ones among these pairs where both transits are flagged. If the planet could not eclipse the same spot in different transits, then anomalies would be independent, thus this ratio would not depend on the period.</p><p>In particular, if we flag p fraction of total transits, then one randomly chosen transit is flagged with probability p, therefore two independent transits are simultaneously flagged with probability p 2 (as long as the number of transits is large). Strong deviation of the ratio of flagged pairs of transits from p 2 as a function of period indicates correlated transit anomalies.</p><p>Note that this method of identifying transit anomalies is different from manually picking them for fitting in Section 5.4. Using a uniform threshold has the advantage that detection does not rely on human decisions. We chose a large threshold (yielding fewer anomalies than what one can see by eye in the lightcurves) to avoid spurious detections. It is important to note that the actual occurrence rates depend strongly on the choice of the threshold, although we find that the general features are persistent across a range of thresholds.</p><p>Good quality observations exist for 204 transits of HAT-P-11b in the Kepler dataset.</p><p>We pick a threshold of 1ˆ´41ˆ´4 , which results in 60 flagged transits. That is, the occurrence rate of transit anomalies above this threshold is p " 0.29. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.6 presents the ratios for a number of periods on the top panel, with the statistical background of p 2 " 0.09 overplotted as a horizontal red line. For example, there are 165 pairs of observed transits that are six orbits apart. If transits in each pair were flagged independently, we would expect to find 165p 2 " 14 pairs of transits separated by six orbits with both transits flagged. However, there are 33 such pairs in the dataset, more than two times as many.</p><p>We perform the same analysis on 587 good quality transit lightcurves of Kepler-17.</p><p>Since Kepler-17 is a fainter target, we use a longer moving boxcar average, with 21 data points, to suppress photon noise. We use the same threshold as for HAT-P-11, resulting in 180 flagged transits. In this case, the occurrence rate is p " 0.31, and the statistical background is p 2 " 0.09. The ratios of flagged pairs of transits as a function of period are presented on the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.6.</p><p>We find the highest occurrence rate at periods of six and eight planetary orbits for HAT-P-11 and Kepler-17, respectively: around 2.3 times the statistical background in both cases. We identify the next largest peaks as aliases of this frequency: at 12, 18, and 24 orbits for HAT-P-11 and 16 and 24 for Kepler-17. These are due to long-lived spots and exhibit decreasing strength, because not all spots that live for one stellar rotation continue to live for another one.</p><p>On the basis of these observations, we can exclude period aliases: if the star rotated two, three, or four times while the planet orbits six times, we would see a strong peak at three, two, or three orbital periods, respectively, in the case of HAT-P-11 on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure   5</ref>.6. A similar argument holds for Kepler-17. These and higher harmonics can also be readily excluded on the basis of the periodogram, the autocorrelation function, the projected rotational velocity of the star, and a priori expectations of rotation rates (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Désert et al., 2011</ref>, for HAT-P-11 and Kepler-17, respectively).</p><p>An important difference between the interpretation of the results for the two planetary systems is due to their different geometry: Kepler-17b has an orbital axis well  aligned with the projected spin axis of the star; therefore, a spot would be eclipsed by the planet again even the periods were not commensurable. On the other hand, HAT-P-11b is known to be on a nearly polar orbit, therefore-as Winn et al. (2010b) pointed out-period commensurability is required for transit anomalies to recur, otherwise the planet would scan a different part of the stellar surface, missing the spot that it had eclipsed a stellar rotation earlier.</p><p>Another consequence of the orbital alignment of Kepler-17b with its host star's rotation is the excess on the side of each peak on the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.6: at 1, 7, 9, 15, 17, etc. planetary orbits. As the star rotates, each spot seems to move parallel to the transit chord, thus spots are eclipsed in multiple subsequent transits (see On the other hand, transits of HAT-P-11b not spaced apart by an integer multiple of six orbits are expected to show spot-induced anomalies independently, because spots on the stellar surface rotate perpendicularly to the transit chord. This is indeed the case, except for secondary peaks at 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27 planetary orbits. The reason for these is the two opposite longitudes where spots seem to occur, as discussed in Section 5.6.</p><p>Finally, we note that the orbital period of HAT-P-11b is 3.3 times that of Kepler-17b; therefore, periods in the upper panel represent correspondingly longer time than those in the lower panel. If we assume that spots have similar lifetime on the two stars, this explains why we see more noise for long periods for HAT-P-11b than for Kepler-17b.</p></div>

For a non-evolving spot, these minima happen repeatedly with the rotational period of the star. In this section, we make use of this effect, together with the assumption that lightcurve variations are mostly due to starspots (supported by the matching order of magnitude of amplitudes shown in Section 5.4), to confirm the rotational periods of HAT-P-11 and Kepler-17.</p><p>To this end, we identify local minima in their lightcurves.  without a significant drift (bottom panel). For both stars, the phase fluctuations of the minima might be due to spot migration, evolution, or new spots appearing at different longitudes.</p><p>The first discovery of phase jumps in a stellar lightcurve was reported by Jetsu et al.</p><p>(1991) on FK Comae Berenices and named "flip-flop behaviour." <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Korhonen et al. (2001)</ref> attribute this phenomenon to two active regions on the star at opposite longitudes, with changing relative activity level. This results in minima in the lightcurve at two phases, with alternatingly one or the other being stronger. This phenomenon is exhibited by a large range of stars: RSCVn binaries, fast rotating G and K dwarfs, and the Sun <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Hussain, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Berdyugina, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b281">Strassmeier, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To determine whether a similar phenomenon takes place on the two stars we study, we quantify how much deeper each minimum is than the deepest neighboring minimum.</p><p>On <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.7, we represent minima that are much deeper than the ones half a stellar rotation earlier and later with black spots and ones that are not so deep with lighter gray spots. Isolated minima, that is, ones that are not preceded or succeeded with one within less than one stellar rotation, are also black.</p><p>We interpret the results for HAT-P-11 as evidence for two flip-flop events: the dominant phase changes from 0.7 to 0.2 around 300 BKJD, and it changes back around 1100 BKJD. The 2 yr interval between these events is consistent with the flip-flop period on other stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Berdyugina, 2005</ref>). On the other hand, we are not able to interpret the results for Kepler-17 as flip-flop cycles with a reasonable period. We draw stars and planets independently from the two sets, 1 000 000 times, and calculate the ratio of the stellar rotational and planetary orbital periods. The top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_60">Figure 5</ref>.8 presents a histogram of the fractional part of such ratios (subtracting the rounded ratio from itself), 0.0 corresponding to an integer ratio. The distribution is flat, consistent with the hypothesis that the prior rotational and orbital period distributions, when considered independently, do not inherenty carry a preference for, neither against, integer period ratios. The underlying reason is that the period distributions are spread out, and taking the fractional part of the ratio averages out small scale variations. This second histogram does not exhibit a significant preference for (or against)</p></div>

This would be unexpected if there was a prevalent starplanet interaction resulting in period commensurability, suggesting that the systems with such commensurability are either special or they happen by coincidence, or that  the effect of such hypothetical interactions is so small that detection is not possible with this sample size.</p><p>The apparently flat period ratio fractional part prior distribution allows us to estimate the probability that commensurability happens by chance. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Walker et al. (2008)</ref> reports a period synchronicity within 0.04% for τ Boo. The probability of this happening by coincidence is 0.08% (the uncertainty is two sided).</p><p>Similarily, the periodogram peak identified in Section 5.2 indicates that the period ratio for the HAT-P-11 system is 6:1 within 0.034%, while the autocorrelation functions tells us that the periods are commensurate within 2.4%. A period ratio so close to 6:1 could happen by chance with a probability of 0.068% and 4.8%, respectively.</p><p>Investigating the fractional part of the period ratio only reveals whether it is close to n:1, where n is an integer. However, the example of Kepler-13 reminds us that other fractions might be of interest too. Therefore we calculate the probability that the period ratio is within 0.034% or within 2.4% (corresponding to the periodogram and autocorrelation function peaks, respectively) of a rational number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers not exceeding 6. (These ratios are 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 2:5, 1:2, 3:5, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 1:1, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 5:3, 2:1, 5:2, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, in increasing order.) We find that among 1 000 000 draws of independent rotational and orbital periods, 0.13% and 8.1% of them have a ratio that falls within the given tolerances, respectively. For comparison, among the 251 planets in our sample, 0.0% and 4.4% of them are so close to any of these ratios, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.8">Star-planet interaction</head><p>To explore the effect of a hypothetical star-planet interaction, first consider two systems without period commensurability. One is CoRoT-6, for which <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Lanza et al. (2011)</ref> report that the spot covering factor gets enhanced when spots on the stellar surface cross a particular longitude with respect to the planet CoRoT-6b. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Herrero et al. (2013)</ref> find a similar behavior on the surface of LHS 6343 A, with a photospheric activity enhancement of existing spots, again at a particular position relative to its brown dwarf companion. Both research groups suggest that it is magnetic interactions that cause the enhancements; see, for example, the models of A resonance effect might exist even if magnetic (or other) interactions between a planet and its host star were too weak to transfer enough angular momentum to make the planet migrate or to change the spin of the star. The same way the companions of CoRoT-6 and LHS 6343 A might cause an enhancement synchronous to their orbit, it is conceivable that if there was a latitude on the surface of a star with a period matching that of its companion, this effect, continuously acting on the same part of the stellar surface, would result in preferential spot formation at that latitude. For example, after measuring the differential rotation of τ Boo, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Catala et al. (2007)</ref> note that this is such a system: the planetary orbital period falls between the stellar rotation periods at the equator and the pole and therefore there is an intermediate latitude with a period matching that of the planet. By this hypothesis, a relatively weak interaction might result in photospheric activity preferentially at this latitude, which would then cause photometric variations synchronous to the planetary orbit. Such variations were later detected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Walker et al. (2008)</ref>, who indeed suggest magnetic interactions between the star and the planet as the cause of this phenomenon.</p><p>We extend this hypothesis from matching periods to general commensurability. For example, if the differential rotation profile of HAT-P-11 happens to be such that at some intermediate latitude, the rotational period is exactly six times the orbital period of HAT-P-11b, then we propose that spot formation might be enhanced at this latitude by resonance with the planet, resulting in a lightcurve reflecting this commensurability, as we have shown in this paper.</p><p>It is possible that a number of small spots might form randomly at different latitudes on the surface of HAT-P-11. These spots might be too small to be detected through their contribution to rotational modulation or transit anomalies. We speculate that interactions with the planet might influence the growth or merger of such small spots, preferentially creating larger ones that we detect at resonant latitudes. Even though many of these large spots might only live for relatively few stellar rotations, the buildup phase during which large spots form from smaller ones might take much longer, possibly long enough for the hypothetical resonance to have a noticeable effect in the resulting large spot distribution as a function of latitude.</p><p>That we have presented another planetary system with a tight commensurability is not enough by itself to prove that there is an interaction at force between certain stars and their close-in planets. While HAT-P-11 is a system with some very unique features, the tight 6:1 commensurability can still be purely by coincidence. One way to confirm our hypothesis is by a statistical analysis of a large number of planet hosts.</p><p>We compared the occurrence rate of detected commensurability with the rate predicted by our hypothesis using reasonable prior distributions for planetary orbital periods and stellar rotational periods. This statistical method could be extended by accounting for differential rotation profiles, possibly by using the sample of 18 616 stars with differential rotation parameters given by <ref type="bibr">Reinhold et al. (2013a,b)</ref>. Note, however, that this prediction is very sensitive to the assumed differential rotation profiles. Another difficulty lies in the method of determining tight commensurability: as we have shown, neither a periodogram nor an autocorrelation function by itself is suitable for this.</p><p>Part of the problem is the evolution of spots, as well as starspots occurring-although possibly in a smaller number-at other latitudes that do not have resonant rotational periods, thereby broadening the period peaks. The third method, using repeated transit anomalies like in this work or for Kepler-17 by <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2011)</ref>, is limited to bright host stars. Finally, identifying lightcurve minima and looking for their periodicity by itself might not be sufficient, since it is not clear a priori if a star has active regions stationary on its surface or if the minima are due to spots appearing independently at random longitudes. One virtue of HAT-P-11 is that we could apply and compare all these methods, and we are able to conclude that there are two dominant active regions, which seem to be stationary on the surface of the star for a long time.</p><p>We note that theoretically there are other ways to prove the hypothetical interaction between HAT-P-11b and its host star. Deming et al. <ref type="formula">(2011)</ref>  However, if interactions with HAT-P-11b induce preferential spot formation on HAT-P-11 at fixed latitudes, this migration pattern might be suppressed. Therefore observing constant active latitudes instead of a butterfly-shaped migration pattern would be a strong indication of interactions between the planet and stellar surface activity. Unfortunately, the activity cycles for stars most similar to HAT-P-11 in color and activity level as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Baliunas et al. (1995)</ref> span from 7 to 21 yr <ref type="bibr">(HD 201091, 190007, and 156026)</ref>, which is much longer than the timespan of Kepler observations. Therefore, even though we do not see strong evidence of spot migration in the Kepler data, we cannot yet determine whether the star exhibits Sun-like spot migration patterns on longer timescales.</p><p>It is also possible that active latitude migration is not suppressed on any star, no matter how strong the interaction with the planet is. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Cranmer &amp; Saar (2007)</ref> theoretically describe a mechanism that can cause the planetary interaction with the stellar magnetic fields to disappear at times (albeit for interactions with the chromosphere, not the photosphere). <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Shkolnik et al. (2008)</ref> observationally confirm this phenomenon on both on HD 179949 and υ And, and dub it the on-off mechanism.</p><p>Even though there is no indication of such an event in the Kepler data for HAT-P-11, this possibility might make it impossible to confirm the effect of the planet on the bases of spot migration patterns only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.9">Conclusion</head><p>The main focus of this paper is to present evidence for the 6:1 commensurability between the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation in the HAT-P-11 system. For reference, we perform the same analysis for <ref type="bibr">Kepler-17b, for which Désert et al. (2011)</ref> observe an 8:1 commensurability on the basis of transit anomalies. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bonomo &amp; Lanza (2012)</ref> show that in fact, spots with a different rotational rate dominate the out-of-transit lightcurve. These results are not necessarily contradictory because of possible differential rotation: in the case of Kepler-17, the spots dominating the lightcurve might lie at a different latitude that the ones observed via anomalies in the transits of the planet with a low projected obliquity.</p><p>We calculate the autocorrelation function for the lightcurve of these two stars and present a statistical analysis of possible spot-induced transit anomaly recurrence periods, which independently exclude frequency aliases of the proposed 6:1 and 8:1 commensurabilities. In the case of HAT-P-11, the recurring transit anomalies imply a tight commensurability because of the polar orbit. We also present periodograms, and propose that the period discrepancy when looking at the FWHM of frequency peaks might be due to spot evolution causing the peaks to split.</p><p>We also present evidence for a tight 6:1 commensurability for HAT-P-11 in the form of four observed transit anomalies presumably due to the same spot. We fit for all observed transit anomalies of HAT-P-11 and feed the resulting spot parameters into macula to show that it is plausible that rotational modulation accounts for most of the out-of-transit lightcurve variation. Furthermore, we identify minima in the lightcurve of both stars and conclude that in the case of HAT-P-11, there is a tight 6:1 period commensurability, whereas for Kepler-17, we confirm the period of 12.01 found by the much more sophisticated analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bonomo &amp; Lanza (2012)</ref>, distinct from the 8:1 commensurability. We identify two active longitudes for both stars and see an indication of two flip-flop events between these active longitudes on HAT-P-11.</p><p>Finally, we hypothesize that for stars with an intermediate latitude with a rotational period commensurable to the orbit of a close planet, star-planet interactions might induce spot formation preferentially at this latitude, which would show up as a resonance between the dominant period in the out-of-transit lightcurve and the planetary orbit, and also as the stroboscopic effect if the planet is transiting and the transit chord intersects this active latitude. However, proving this hypothesis might be difficult mostly because of the small number of bright targets and the uncertainties in differential rotation We analyze Kepler observations of the planetary host star HAT-P-11, and study the size and contrast of more than two hundred starspots. We find that the flux ratio of spots ranges at least from 0.6 to 0.9, corresponding to an effective temperature approximately 100 to 450 K lower than the stellar surface, although it is possible that some spots are darker than 0.5. The largest detected spots have a radius less than approximately 0.2 stellar radii.</p></div>

An unocculted spot -since it is darker than the stellar surfacecauses a blend in the opposite sense as a background star, leading to a deeper transit (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Czesla et al., 2009</ref>). On the other hand, a spot causes an anomalous rebrightening when it is eclipsed by the planet, because the planet blocks less flux than it would if the spot was not behind it.</p><p>Such spot-induced transit lightcurve anomalies were first observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Silva (2003)</ref> in HST observations of HD 209458. Other systems exhibiting similar features include HD 189733 <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Pont et al., 2007)</ref> and TrES-1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Rabus et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Czesla et al. (2009)</ref> found a correlation between stellar brightness and transit depth in the system CoRoT-2, which they attribute to varying levels of stellar activity, and show how this effect, when unaccounted for, causes a bias in the planet size estimate.</p><p>In the era of the Kepler satellite, a large number of planets transiting active stars have been discovered and observed with high temporal and photometric resolution, providing further examples of transit anomalies. Two such systems are <ref type="bibr">Kepler-17 (Désert et al., 2011</ref>) and HAT-P-11 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al., 2010)</ref>. Spots revealed by transit anomalies can be used, for example, to constrain the projected obliquity and the stellar inclination <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Deming et al., 2011;</ref>. Measuring the spot contrast allows one to constrain the temperature of the spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">(Silva, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b237">Rabus et al., 2009</ref>). However, there is a degeneracy between the spot size and contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Pont et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b294">Tregloan-Reed et al., 2013)</ref>, which makes high quality data necessary to infer temperatures.</p><p>The large number of photometric observations of transit anomalies motivates the development of astrophysical models. Examples include the model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Silva (2003)</ref>, the one by <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Wolter et al. (2009)</ref>, SOAP-T by <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">Oshagh et al. (2013)</ref>, and prism by <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">Tregloan-Reed et al. (2013)</ref>. These models all assume homogeneous, circular spots, with four input parameters for each spot (two for position, one for size, one for darkness).</p><p>The first two models simplify the geometry by assuming that the spots are circular in projection, while the other two properly account for the elliptical projected shape given spots that are circular on the stellar surface. These models all define a large resolution two dimensional grid either on the stellar surface or in the projection plane, and numerically integrate over two coordinates to calculate the transit lightcurve.</p><p>Integration in two dimensions can be computationally expensive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Kipping (2012)</ref> introduced macula, an analytic model for a related but different phenomenon: spots on the rotating stellar surface modulating out-of-transit lightcurves of spotted stars. Its analytic nature makes macula faster than numerical models for the same phenomenon, like SOAP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Boisse et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present spotrod, a counterpart of macula for transit lightcurves of spotted stars. We describe the problem as a two dimensional integral in polar coordinates in the projection plane. Using assumptions similar to those of previous models, we derive an analytic formulation for the integral with respect to the polar angle, so that numerical integration needs to be performed only with respect to the radial coordinate. This semi-analytic nature provides improved speed over previous models requiring two dimensional numerical integration. In particular, if the resolution of the integration grid is n in each dimension, then a double numerical integral takes O pn 2 q time to evaluate, whereas spotrod runs in Opnq time. Typical values are n « 300 for SOAP, n « 750 for the model of Silva <ref type="formula">(2003)</ref>, and the grid spacing being one hundredth of the planet diameter for prism, resulting in n « 1000 for a typical hot Jupiter or n « 2000 for HAT-P-11b. In this work we use n " 1000.</p><p>We describe the semi-analytic model in Section 6.2: we state the simplifying assumptions, describe the two dimensional integral in polar coordinates, and introduce the subroutines of spotrod, the free and open source implementation available for the astronomical community. In Section 6.3, we apply spotrod to Kepler observations of HAT-P-11, investigate model artifacts like observational biases and correlations of fit parameters for individual spots, validate spotrod on synthetic data generated by prism, study the distribution of spot size and contrast on HAT-P-11 that we believe to be physical, and look at the model residuals for validation. Section 6.4 concludes our findings. Technical details of the model pertaining to calculating angles and handling spots that are partially behind the limb are given in Appendix 6.A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Assumptions</head><p>Our model has two major assumptions. The first one is that the boundary of each spot is a circle on the surface of the spherical star. We define the radius a of the spot to be the radius of this circle in three-dimensional space, in units of stellar radius. We assume that 0 ă a ă 1. Note that the analytic rotational modulation model macula <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Kipping, 2012</ref>) takes as input parameter the half angle α of the cone with this circle as its directrix and the center of the star as its apex, which is related to the radius by a " sin α.</p><p>We define the center of the spot as the intersection point of the surface of the sphere and the axis of this cone. Note that the center of the spot does not lie in the plane of the boundary. The advantage of this definition is that the center is on the stellar surface, allowing for easier conversion between input parameters of spotrod and macula, and easier treatment of stellar rotation. A further advantage of characterizing the spot location with the projection of a point on the stellar surface over the projection of the geometrical center of the spot boundary in the interior of the star is that its domain does not depend on the spot radius, which also makes it easier to define an isotropic prior for the location of the spot.</p><p>The second assumption is that each spot is homogeneous and observes the same limb darkening law as the star. This means that as viewed by the observer, the ratio of the flux from a spot and the flux from the unspotted stellar surface at the same projected distance r from the center of the star does not depend on the distance r. We denote this dimensionless flux ratio by f in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Kipping (2012)</ref>. Note that flux ratio is sometimes called contrast, for example, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">Tregloan-Reed et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>Assuming a constant flux ratio across the stellar disk is consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Walton et al. (2003)</ref>: they study a sample of 18 000 spots on the Sun, and observe no dependence of spot contrast on where the spot is seen. Note that what they call contrast can be expressed as f ´ 1 using our notation. As for the homogeneity of spots, we shall see in Section 6.2.4 how to compose more complicated structures, like a spot with umbra and penumbra, using two homogeneous spots.</p></div>

It evaluates the inner integral analytically in the form of the sum given in Equations (6.3) and (6.4) on each annulus defined by the input array of r values.

We recommend an integration mesh of n « 1000 values uniformly spaced between 0 and 1. More complicated rules can also be prescribed. For example, since the integrand of the outer integral grows rapidly with r in Equations (6.1-6.4), one might wish to use a nonuniform mesh that is coarser for small r and finer for large r. These values do not depend on spot parameters, and recalculating the same values of δ in each iteration would be very costly, since it has to be calculated for each observation time and each r: hundreds of thousands of times in a typical application. Instead, we evaluate δ hundreds of thousands of times only once, before we start the fit or MCMC, and then use these precalculated values.</p><p>We can also avoid evaluating the function ellipseangle hundreds of thousands of time in each iteration if we neglect the effect of stellar rotation during a single transit.</p><p>In this case, for a given set of spots, γ i prq does not depend on time, therefore we only need to calculate it n times: once for each value of r.</p><p>It is, of course, also possible to model a transit in the extreme case of a star that rotates so rapidly that spots move substantially during the duration of the planetary transit.

This method, however, is slower than if we assumed that spots were stationary within the duration of a single transit. </p></div>

It has been known to host HAT-P-11b, a transiting hot Neptune on a 4.9 day orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al., 2010)</ref>, before the launch of the Kepler mission, and therefore has been observed with short (one minute) cadence from the beginning, during quarters 0-6, 9-10, 12-14, and 16-17. Missing data in quarters 7, 11, and 15 are due to the failure of a readout module in 2010 January. We perform our analysis on this dataset, using the flux values in the SAP FLUX column, and dividing each transit by a linear fit to the out-of-transit data within 0.12 days from the midtransit time to normalize the transit lightcurves. Visual inspection shows that a linear fit is satisfactory, because the out-of-transit lightcurve modulation timescale is the rotation period of HAT-P-11, which is 29.2 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bakos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Béky et al., 2014a</ref>), much larger than the 0.24 days of the total width of our window.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Analysis of individual spots</head><p>First, we present the analysis of two individual starspots in order to study correlations between spot parameters inherent to the model. Each spot is described by four parameters: x and y are the coordinates of the spot center in stellar radius units, as seen by the observer, in a Cartesian coordinate system whose origin is the center of the stellar disk, and where the planet is moving approximately in the positive x direction during transit. (More precisely, for inclined orbits the y axis is defined by projecting the line of sight on the orbital plane, then projecting that on the sky plane. For an inclined eccentric orbit, the projected velocity of the planet is not exactly parallel to the x axis at mid-transit, except for special values of the argument of periastron.) The other two parameters are the spot radius a and the flux ratio f described in Section 6.2.1. half an hour after midtransit during transit 218. We also plot the best fit (least sum of squared residuals) spotrod lightcurves for both transits in red on this figure.</p><p>In fact, for transit 218, we find two best fit solutions: in the projection plane, the spot can either be situated above or below the transit chord. To illustrate this bimodality, we present on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.3 an observer's view of the star (large empty circle), the planet (black filled circle), and the best fit solutions for the single spot (gray ellipses) during transits 74 and 218. The transit chord is also drawn, as wide as the diameter of  . Large circle is the star, solid black small circle is the planet HAT-P-11b at midtransit, gray strip is the transit chord, one or two gray ellipses are best fit solutions for the one or two modes of the spot. the planet. We do not find the same bimodality in case of transit 74, therefore only one solution is depicted. Note that in fact we plot two model lightcurves for transit 218 on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.2, corresponding to the best fits for each mode. However, they are indistinguisable on this figure, which is closely related to our inability to infer which solution describes the spot in reality.</p><p>We run parallel tempered MCMC simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Earl &amp; Deem, 2005</ref>) for both transits, using the emcee software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Foreman-Mackey et al., 2013)</ref>, at 10 different temperatures, with 100 concurrent chains at each temperature. We first run both simulations for 1000 steps for burn-in. By inspecting the evolution of the mean and scatter of each parameter, we find that the chain already converges after about half this many steps. Then we run the simulation for another 1000 steps to sample what we believe to be the equilibrium distribution. The lowest, zero temperature chain provides us with the equilibrium distribution, whereas the higher temperature chains guarantee that we explore the entire parameter space, and have samples in disconnected modes in numbers proportional to the corresponding posterior probabilities. of the planet at midtransit, which is very close the the impact parameter b (in fact they would be the same for a circular orbit), to help distinguish the two modes and inspect symmetry with respect to the transit chord. We immediately confirm that there is only one mode for transit 74, and two modes for transit 218. The reason for this is that the anomaly during transit 74 can be well described by a spot that lies under the transit chord, therefore the two modes overlap. On the other hand, the lightcurve of transit 218 can only be well modelled if the spot is further away from the transit chord, in which case the two modes are disconnected. We note that we experience bimodality for roughly one quarter of all spots in the entire Kepler dataset for HAT-P-11. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.4 also tells us about the correlations of spot parameters. First, we note that in both cases, x is better constrained than y, even within a single mode. Recall that x is the coordinate (almost exactly) parallel to the transit chord, therefore it directly relates to when the anomaly is observed, which is well defined by the observations. On the other hand, we shall see that y correlates with other parameters that together shape the transit anomaly, resulting in a larger uncertainty.</p><p>We also note that the two solutions of transit 218 have slightly different best fit x values, even though x is fairly well constrained. The explanation for this is that since the spot is elliptical in projection, with its semi-major axis not quite parallel to the y axis, therefore the two spot solutions must have different x coordinates in order to intersect the transit chord at roughly the same x coordinate. This effect can also be  The joint distribution of a and y for the spot in transit 218 on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.4 tells us that the larger the spot is, the further it has to be from the transit chord. This is expected from geometrical arguments, as the duration of the transit anomaly can be well constrained from the observations. This correlation between spot parameters has been first pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Silva (2003)</ref>. However, this effect does not show for transit 74, probably due to the spot being close to the transit chord.</p><p>If we inspect the joint distribution of f and y for either transit, we notice that if the spot is brighter (has a larger flux ratio), then it is likely to be closer to the transit chord. Such a correlation was first noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Wolter et al. (2009)</ref>, and it remains to be explained.</p><p>Finally, we notice that there is a strong correlation between a and f for transit 74:</p><p>the brighter the spot is, the larger it has to be. This correlation has been reported </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">Test on synthetic lightcurves</head><p>In this section, we generate synthetic transit lightcurves, and apply to them the same analysis as in the last section. We use prism <ref type="bibr" target="#b294">(Tregloan-Reed et al., 2013)</ref> for generating lightcurves, and analyze them using spotrod. Using different models for data generation and analysis allows us to validate them agains each other, that is, make sure that parameters like spot radius and flux ratio are interpreted identically, and they produce the same result.</p><p>We take the best fit parameters of the spots in transits 74 and 218, convert the projected coordinates to equatorial coordinates as expected by prism, and generate two model transits. The difference from the spotrod model with the same input parameters has mean 10´810´8 and standard deviation 2 ¨ 10´610´6 across all observation times, which indicates a good agreement between the two models. For comparison, the mean photon noise is 8 ¨ 10´510´5 for the same data points.</p><p>We find that the spotrod best fit has residuals with a standard deviation approximately 1.3 times that predicted by the SAP FLUX ERR data column of the Kepler dataset, therefore we add independent, normally distributed noise scaled to 1.3 times the corresponding SAP FLUX ERR value to each data point calculated by prism. We run an MCMC simulation on the resulting synthetic lightcurves for both transits, in a fashion identical to that explained in the previous section. The resulting chain distribution is presented on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.5.</p><p>Comparing Figures 6.4 and 6.5, we find that the chains converge to roughly the same parameters, further confirming that prism and spotrod interpret input parameters in compatible ways. We also find that the extent and shape of the equilibrium distributions, that is, the correlations between spot parameters, are roughly the same. In case of transit 218, even though the synthetic lightcurve is generated based on only one of the two modes, we are unable to determine which mode it is from the MCMC analysis: the distribution is bimodal, just like it was for Kepler observations.</p><p>The ultimate test to decide whether bimodality and parameter correlations are inherent properties of lightcurve models, and not unique to the implementation we use, would be to run MCMC analysis using prism or another model, other than spotrod. However, since all previously known models require numerical integration in two dimensions, this would be prohibitively computationally expensive. Instead, we rely on the very small difference of the two lightcurve models when run with the same input parameters to conclude that spotrod reproduces the results of prism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.3">Distribution of spot parameters</head><p>In order to study the spot ensemble distribution, we look for anomalies in 204 transits of with four spots each, 400 chains. We have four dimensions of parameter space for each spot: x, y, a, and f . We run the simulations for 1000 steps that we discard. Again, inspection of the chain shows that roughly half of this is already enough for convergence.</p><p>Then we run the chain for another 1000 steps to sample the supposedly equilibrium distribution. This yields the dataset that we use for our analysis in this paper, and the same dataset is used by <ref type="bibr">Béky et al. (2014a)</ref>.</p><p>The next step is to quantify how much better fit these models provide than if we modelled the lightcurve without the spots. In order to do so, we calculate the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is the sum of χ 2 and an additional term penalizing extra model parameters to avoid overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">(Schwarz, 1978)</ref>. We find that every single one of the 203 spots yields a BIC value at least 25.0 lower than the model without that spot, which is a very significant improvement, justifying every spot in our analysis.</p><p>This suggests that probably more spots could be carefully included.</p><p>We present the spot radius-flux ratio distribution of all spots on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6, left middle panel. Note that the distribution of most individual spots overlap, except for a few, which appear as separate clusters on the figure. The distribution is bounded from the side of small radius and large flux ratio by an observational bias: whether we visually inspect the lightcurves or apply an algorithmic transit anomaly search, small amplitude anomalies will be lost in photon noise. The maximum eclipsed spot area is the smaller of R 2 p and a 2 relative to the stellar disk, therefore the maximum transit anomaly amplitude for given a and f is A max " min`R min` min`R 2 p , a 2 ˘ p1´fp1´p1´f q (not accounting for limb darkening and projection distortion). The actual amplitude of the transit anomaly can be less, depending on y. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6 shows the A max " 0.0002 curve in red, where 0.0002 is an arbitrarily chosen value, which seems to act as an approximate amplitude threshold for anomalies that we detected.</p><p>We note that for small spots, individual spot distributions spread along constant min`R min` min`R 2 p , a 2 ˘ p1´fp1´p1´f q curves. The reason is that this quanitity describes the total amount of flux missing due to the spot, which is directly related to the shape of the transit lightcurve anomaly, and therefore can be well constrained. For small spots, the anomaly does not last long, therefore there are fewer data points than for large spots. This makes it difficult to resolve the degeneracy between radius and flux ratio. For large spots, however, the transit anomaly has a larger amplitude, which can directly be used to infer the flux ratio. Note that consistently with this argument, the rightmost panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.4 show that the flux ratio of the small spot seen in transit 74 has a much larger uncertainty than that of the large spot seen in transit 218, even though they have comparable relative uncertainties of their radii.</p><p>This effect results in small spots having a weaker constraint on flux ratio. However, as we will see later in this section, this does not indicate the presence of small, dark spots. Because of this large flux ratio uncertainty of small spots, we are not able to detect a significant correlation between spot radius and flux ratio for the 203 spots studied.</p><p>The bottom left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6 shows the joint distribution of spot radius and y coordinate for all spots. Because of the polar orbit of HAT-P-11b, the latter roughly corresponds to the longitude of the spot on the stellar surface. In this case, we can assume that there is no physical correlation between the two parameters, therefore we have to interpret the joint distribution in terms of observational biases. The observed radius is bounded from below, because very small spots would not cause a detectable signal in the lightcurve. For values of y further from the transit chord, the smallest detectable radius increases for geometrical reasons: the spot has to overlap with the strip that the planet scans on the stellar surface. Finally, the spot radius is bounded from above by the physical distribution of spots, and we expect this to be independent from y. However, this is not reflected on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6: we see that MCMC states with radius above 0.2 prefer values of y further from b. We interpret this as an artifact: we suspect that the lightcurve anomaly due to irregularly shaped spots or spot groups, when mistakenly interpreted as a single spot, results in a large spot further from the transit chord. We believe this radius is unphysical, because we never see transit anomalies that last long enough to require a spot of similar size with y « b as an explanation.</p><p>Therefore we conclude that the upper limit of physical spot radius distribution is at most somewhat lower than 0.2, the radius of the largest detected spot with y « b. It is also possible that this is not a single spot either, so the actual upper radius limit might be smaller than this.</p><p>The three side panels on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6 show histograms of spot radius, flux ratio, and y coordinate, generated from the MCMC chains for all spots. The same observational biases are reflected here: there are no very small (a « 0) spots, and no very bright (f « 1) spots, because these would be undetectable. y is concentrated around the impact parameter, because this is where even small spots are eclipsed by the planet. On the other hand, even though bright spots are more frequent than dark ones, our first impression is that there is a number of almost black spots, that is, spots with f close to zero. Note that a large number density in terms of a spot parameter, that is, large bin count in the histogram corresponds to a less steep curve when data points are plotted in increasing order of that parameter. However, when closely inspecting the parameter uncertainties of individual spots, we see that the ones that seem to be consistent with being very dark show a flux ratio distribution that includes much larger flux ratios as well. In fact, only two spots have a 3σ confidence interval that excludes flux ratios above 0.5, even though 30 spots have median flux ratio and 36 spots have best fit (least sum of squared residuals) flux ratio lower than 0.5. On the other hand, more than half of all spots studied are consisent with having a flux ratio not exceeding 0.5 at the 3σ level. Therefore we cannot either prove or disprove the existence of spots darker than f " 0.5. On the other hand, many spots with flux ratios from approximately 0.6 to 0.9 have small flux ratio uncertainties, suggesting the existence of spots brighter than f " 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.4">Spot temperature</head><p>Assuming that the stellar photosphere and the spots both radiate as black bodies, one can calculate the spot temperature T s from the flux ratio f and the effective photospheric temperature T eff . This method was first applied to infer the spot temperature in the context of spot-induced transit lightcurve anomalies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Silva (2003)</ref>. As we noted in Section 6.3.3, we cannot infer anything about the existence of spots with flux ratio less than 0.5. Therefore we cannot determine whether there are spots with spot temperature below the corresponding temperature of T s " 4180 ˘ 40 K, or a temperature difference of ∆T " 600 ˘ 10 K.</p><p>On the other hand, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.7 tells us that there are spots with well constrained flux ratios ranging approximately from f " 0.6 to 0.9. In terms of temperature, this means that there exist spots ranging approximately from T s " 4330 K to 4680 K (∆T " 450 K to 100 K). It is possible that HAT-P-11 also has brighter spots (that are not detected due to observational bias), and darker spots.</p><p>For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Walton et al. (2003)</ref> show that the Sun exhibits spots ranging from f « 0.15 (with a « 0.03) up to f « 0.7 (with a « 0.01), where the flux ratio is measured at 672.3 nm with 10 nm bandpass. This shows that HAT-P-11 is not the only star where individual spots are thought to exhibit a large range of flux ratios. We note that this value is lower than the flux ratio of the majority of spots we found on HAT-P-11, though we were not able to either confirm or exclude the existence of spots with such low flux ratios. However, the result of O' <ref type="bibr">Neal et al. (2004)</ref> is averaged over all spots visible on the stellar disk, and the temperature range of individual spots cannot be determined by their method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.5">Transit anomaly duration and amplitude</head><p>In addition to investigating the parameters taken by spotrod: x, y, a, and f , it is also interesting to study directly observable properties of spot eclipses: the duration and amplitude of the transit anomaly. Given the results of MCMC calculations, the easiest way to extract these properties is to measure them on model lightcurves. We therefore draw 1000 states from each chain, and generate model lightcurves with one spot each.</p><p>We calculate the amplitude of the transit anomaly as the maximum deviation from a spotless model, and the duration of the transit anomaly as the length of the time interval on which the model with one spot predicts more flux than the spotless model.</p><p>The resulting distribution is plotted on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.8.</p><p>The transit anomaly duration-amplitude distribution is confined from three sides.</p><p>The amplitude is bounded from below, as described in Section 6.3.3. We draw a red line on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.8 at A " 0.0002, the same amplitude value as on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6. Note, however, that the transit anomaly amplitude is represented directly on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.8, whereas on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.6, we could only calculate the maximum possible value A max for given values of a and f . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.8 tells us that visual inspection as performed by the authors results in an amplitude limit that is mostly constant across anomaly durations. Anomalies selected programmatically, however, might have a different boundary, as it is possible to identify an anomaly with a smaller amplitude in noisy data if it lasts sufficiently long.</p><p>From the side of short anomalies, the distribution is bounded by geometrical arguments. The amplitude of the anomaly tells us how much flux is missing with respect to a spotless transit. This places a lower limit on the geometrical extent of the spot, which then translates to the duration of the event. To characterize this boundary, we feed 10 000 random black spots with to spotrod, and plot the envelope of their duration-amplitude distribution in black on cause anomalies with the same duration but smaller amplitude than if they were black (f " 0), therefore we only draw black spots to determine this boundary. We notice that the MCMC distribution extends close to this boundary, which means that the chains contain spot states that are almost entirely black. As discussed in Section 6.3.3, however, this does not mean that the best fit for those spots is necessarily black.</p><p>From the right and above, however, the distribution does not extend to its theoretical limits: the maximum conceivable amplitude would be the transit depth (for a black spot that is larger than the planet), and the maximum conceivable transit duration would be the transit duration. The largest amplitude we observe is roughly half of this, and the longest anomaly lasts only about one quarter of the entire transit. We interpret these limits as indications of the actual spot parameter distribution, namely the lack of large dark spots, and the upper limit on spot size a AE 0.2. We also note that on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure   6</ref>.8, the longest transit anomalies seem to have small amplitudes, for which we cannot offer an explanation.</p><p>While measuring directly observable quantities like transit anomaly duration and amplitude on models generated by spotrod is very convenient, we note that this inevitably introduces biases. For example, if we observe an anomaly with duration and amplitude that would place it on the left of the black curve on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.8, that could not be reproduced by spotrod, and consequently we would measure different duration and amplitude values with our method. However, our MCMC analysis disentangles multiple spots and measures transit anomaly durations efficiently, and still yields meaningful conclusions about the darkness of spots and the amplitude threshold for detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.6">Residuals</head><p>Finally, we study the distribution of residuals to assess the goodness of fit, and to compare our model with 203 spots to the spotless lightcurve model. We calculate lightcurves using spotrod and the Mandel-Agol model for the two cases, respectively.</p><p>We only consider the residuals at observations that took place during transits (between first and fourth contact). We use the SAP FLUX ERR column calculated by the Kepler Photometric Analysis module as the error estimate of the lightcurve data in the SAP FLUX column. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.9 displays the normalized residual distribution histograms: in black when calculated using the spotless model, and in red when calculated using our model with spots, with a logarithmic vertical scale. The spotless model residuals have a large excess on the positive side, which we attribute to the presence of spot-induced transit lightcurve anomalies. On the other hand, our spotrod model accounts for enough spots to make the residual distribution fairly symmetric. We note that this might potentially be used as a detection method to identify targets that exhibit spot-induced transit anomalies.</p><p>In terms of the Mandel-Agol fit, it is interesting to note that the largest residual is 25.75σ. Comparing this to the transit depth of roughly 50 sigma, we see that the largest transit anomaly has an amplitude of half the transit depth, just as we noted in Section 6.3.5. (The exact transit depth expressed in units of photon noise varies due to the quarterly rotations of the Kepler satellite.)</p><p>The relative error of HAT-P-11 photometry is very small (AE 10´410´4 ). Assuming that it is dominated by photon noise, the error distribution can be approximated with an independent normal distribution for each data point. In this case, it is valid to calculate χ 2 , and from that, reduced χ 2 . For the models without and with spots, we get the strikingly different values χ 2 spotless " 1.7 ¨ 10 5 and χ 2 spots " 3.3 ¨ 10 4 , respectively. The total number of observations taken during the 130 transits is N " 18 135. Since we fix orbital parameters, transit ephemeris, and limb darkening, the spotless model has no fit parameters.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we present spotrod, a transit lightcurve model accounting for both eclipsed and uneclipsed starspots. The advantage of our model over previous methods is that in polar coordinates, we integrate analytically with respect to the polar angle, therefore time-consuming numerical integration only remains to be performed along a single dimension, the radial coordinate. This feature makes our model fast enough not only for fitting, but also for efficient statistical investigations using, for example, MCMC. A free and open source implementation of our model is publicly available.</p><p>The model assumes that spots follow the same limb darkening law as the stellar photosphere, consistent with observations of the Sun ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Walton et al., 2003)</ref>. It also assumes that spots are homogeneous. Umbra-penumbra structure can be mimicked by superimposing two concentric spots, while bright features can also be modelled using a flux ratio exceeding unity. We apply our model to Kepler data of HAT-P-11 transits. We investigate correlations between fit parameters of individual spots, and confirm findings of previous investigations using similar models. We also study the size and flux ratio distributions. We establish an upper limit of AE 0.2 for the spot radius, and find strong indication for the presence of spot with flux ratio ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, corresponding to an effective temperature 100 to 450 K lower than that of the spotless photosphere. We cannot prove nor disprove the existence of spots with flux ratio less than 0.5. We do not find a significant correlation between spot size and flux ratio.</p><p>While HAT-P-11 is unique in its brightness and large transit anomaly amplitudes within the Kepler field, spotrod can potentially be used to model Kepler observations of other transiting planetary hosts. In addition, comparable quality photometric observations are expected to taken of a much larger number of stars, for example, by the K2 mission of the Kepler satellite ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Haas et al., 2014)</ref>, and by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">Ricker et al., 2010</ref>).</p><p>While our model provides a good fit to observations of HAT-P-11, it is important to keep in mind that our perfectly circular and homogeneous spots are a simplified version of what the stellar surface actually looks like. However, mapping out the projected stellar surface by, for example, two dimensional deconvolution with the planetary disk, is an underdetermined and potentially numerically unstable inversion problem. The general advantage of model simplifications is that the small degree of freedom makes fitting robust. This is exactly what spotrod provides: a simplistic, approximate, but robust and fast way to model transit lightcurves of spotted stars.  In projection (as seen by the observer), the spot is an ellipse with semi-major axis a, and semi-minor axis b " a sin β " a a 1 ´ px 2 s ` y 2 s q. (6.6)</p><p>The center of this ellipse is the projection of the intersection point of the axis of the cone and the plane in which the spot boundary lies, not the projection of the center of the spot which is on the stellar surface. The center of the ellipse lies at a distance of ? 1 ´ a 2 from the center of the star, therefore in projection, the distance between the center of the stellar disk and the center of the ellipse is z " ? 1 ´ a 2 cos β " ? 1 ´ a 2 a x 2 s ` y 2 s . (6.7) Expressing x 2 s ` y 2 s from Equation (6.7) and substituting into Equation (6.6), we can express b in terms of a and z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">b " a c 1 ´ z 2 1 ´ a 2 .</formula><p>(6.8)</p><p>The input parameters of the subroutine integratetransit are x s , y s , and a: it calculates z from Equation (6.7), and passes it to ellipseangle, which in turn calculates b using Equation (6.8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.A.2 Calculating γ, γ ˚ , and δ</head><p>To calculate γprq, consider a Cartesian coordinate system in the projection plane with the center of the ellipse as the origin, the x axis parallel to the semi-major axis, the y to the semi-minor axis. Let the center of the stellar disk be at p0, zq, and let px, yq denote an intersection point of the ellipse and C r . See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.11. Then px, yq satisfies the following set of quadratic equations:</p><p>x 2 a 2 ` y 2 b 2 " 1 (6.9)</p><p>x 2 ` py´zqpy´py´zq 2 " r 2 . four intersection points, then they must be located symmetrically around the y axis, because if px, yq is a solution, then so is p´x, yq (and they coincide if x " 0). After solving for y, we calculate γ using γ " arccos z ´ y r .</p><p>Appendix 6.A.3 discusses the case of four intersection points. One or three intersection points are singular cases between other cases, and can be treated along with the case on either side.</p><p>Let R p denote the radius of the planet, and z p its projected separation from the center of the stellar disk, both in stellar radius units. To calculate δprq, we could repeat the above derivation with a " b " R p . Or we can use the law of cosines in the triangle defined by the center of the star, the center of the planet, and the intersection point of the edge of the planet with C r : R 2 p " r 2 ` z 2 p ´ 2rz p cos δprq, as seen on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.12. Again, the cases of C r being disjoint from or entirely occulted</p><p>by the planet should be tested for separately, yielding δ " 0 and δ " π, respectively.</p><p>Finally, let θ denote the angle between the center of the spot and the center of the planet as seen from the center of the star, which we also calculate using the law of cosines. We always choose the angle for which 0 ď θ ď π. Now γ ˚ prq is determined by γprq, δprq, and θ according to the following cases: The function circleangle calculates β from r, z p , and R p , ellipseangle calculates γ from r, z, and a, and finally integratetransit calculates γ ˚ based on Equation (6.11), evaluates the integrals of Equations <ref type="formula">(6.</ref>3) and (6.4), and calculates F normalized according to Equation (6.5).</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">γ ˚ " $ ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' &amp; ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' % γ if θ ě γ ` δ (arcs disjoint) γ ´ δ if γ ě θ ` δ (planet</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.A.3 Spots partially behind the limb</head><p>The boundary of the spot is assumed to be a circle, therefore its projection (as seen by the observer) is an ellipse. However, we must investigate whether the boundary of what we see of the spot coincides with the projection of its boundary on the stellar surface. It is easy to see that it is indeed the case as long as no part of the spot covers another part of it. That is, as long as the entire spot is visible, we will always see it as an ellipse. (Remember the caveat that the center of this ellipse is not the projection of what we defined as the center of the spot.)</p><p>However, when the spot partially hides behind the stellar limb, we will see it as a shape bounded by an arc of an ellipse (the projection of the spot boundary) and an arc of a circle (the edge of the stellar disk), as illustrated on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.14. We prove in the next section that in this case, the ellipse touches the stellar limb from the inside.</p><p>The two cases (the entire spot visible, or part of it is behind the limb) are delineated by a critical value of β, or equivalently, a critical value of z, both of which we expect to depend only on a. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.10, we can see that in this critical case, using Equation (6.7) to express z in terms of a and β.</p><p>If z ă z crit , then the entire spot is visible. If z " z crit , then the ellipse touches the edge of the stellar limb at one point, as we prove in the next section. If z ą z crit , then part of the spot is behind the stellar limb. Note that since we describe the spot with the parameter z (implicity, through x s and y s ), z " 1 corresponding to the spot center being on the stellar limb, therefore we cannot deal with spots that are partially visible, but their center is behind the limb. Such spots, however, will have a small contribution to F s and F transit , because only a very small part of them is visible, furthermore this small part is on the limb, which is usually darker to start with. Furthermore, since F s « F transit as long as R p ! 1, omitting such a spot will have a very small effect on F normalized .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.A.4 Number of intersection points</head><p>In this section, we prove that as long as z ă z crit , the spot boundary and C r can have at most two intersection points. We also explain how to correctly model the ellipse in terms of γ if z ą z crit and there are four intersection points. Finally, we prove that if z " z crit , then the spot boundary ellipse touches the stellar limb at one point, and if z ą z crit , then at two points.</p><p>Let us express x 2 from Equation (6.9) and substitute into Equation (6.10). This results in a quadratic equation for y: This inequality is a sufficient condition for that y ´ does not represent real intersection points, that is, there are at most two intersection points (corresponding to y ` ) Now we increase the left hand side of Inequality (6.13). This will make it sharper, leading to a more restrictive, therefore still sufficient (but not necessary) condition. If we find at the end that this still holds whenever z ă z crit , that proves our original statement: To understand the dependence of the number of intersection points on r, we plot y ˘ as a function of r on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.15. So far we have proven that if z ă z crit , then y ´ ă ´b for all values of r, which case is illustrated on the top panels. We have one intersection point if and only if |y`||y`|y`| " b, which happens at r " z ˘ b, when C r touches the ellipse.</p><p>In case z ą z crit , let us investigate how to properly account for the spot shape. If r ă z ´ b, then C r is disjoint from the spot. At r " z ´ b, the circle C r touches the ellipse, we have y ` " b, yielding x " 0 as a multiple root for the intersection point.</p><p>Further increasing r will result in y ` ă b, representing two distinct real solutions for x.</p><p>When r reaches z ` b, C r will touch the ellipse from the inside at a point corresponding to y ´ " ´b, x " 0: this is the third point of intersection.</p><p>This can happen if and only if the radius R of the osculating circle at the endpoint of the semi-minor axis is larger than r " z ` b. As a sanity check, let us investigate what it means in terms of z:</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">R ą r a 2 b ą z ` b.</formula><p>This inequality is az b times Inequality (6.16) with the inequality sign in the other direction. Inequality (6.16), in turn, is equivalent to Inequality (6.18). That is, the condition on the curvature of the ellipse is equivalent to Inequality (6.18) with the inequality sign in the other direction: z ą z crit . This is consistent with our previous statements.</p><p>Further increasing r will yield four distinct intersection points, with´bwith´b ă y ´ ă y ` ă b. This scenario is also demonstrated on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_85">Figure 6</ref>.14. By continuity, the outside pair of intersection points corresponds to y ` , because they exist ever since r " z ´ b.</p><p>The inside pair only appeared at r " z ` b, and therefore corresponds to y ´ , which crossed´bcrossed´b at the same value of r. , the lower branch is y ´ . Horizontal dashed lines are drawn at y " ˘b, vertical dotted lines at r " z ˘ b where |y| " b. Right panels: spots in projection, with C r 1 and C r 2 , the two circles that touch the projection of the boundary of the spots (not the boundary of their projection), in dotted lines. Top panels: a " 0.2, z crit " 0.96, the spot is entirely visible. Bottom panels: a " 0.6, z crit " 0.64, the spot is partially behind the limb. In both cases, b " 0.12, z " 0.78, r 1 " 0.66, r 2 " 0.90.</p><p>Our code always calculates γ based on y ` . This means that the entire arc between the outside intersection points is considered to be part of the spot, which correctly describes the shape of the spot as the observer sees it. That is, the code gives the correct result even in case z ą z crit .</p><p>Finally, if r " 1, then the inside and outside pair of intersection points coincide according to <ref type="bibr">Figures 6.14 and 6.15</ref>: the ellipse touches the stellar limb from the inside.</p><p>Another way of saying this is y ´ " y ` , which happens exactly if the discriminant of Equation (6.12) is zero. We now prove this statement.</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">B 2 ´ 4AC " 0 4z 2 ´ 4 ˆ a 2 b 2 ´ 1 ˙ ` r 2 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ˘ " 0 z 2 ´ ˜ 1 1 ´ z 2 1´a 2 ´ 1 ¸ ` 1 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ˘ " 0 z 2 ´ ˆ 1 ´ a 2 1 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ´ 1 ˙ ` 1 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ˘ " 0 z 2 ´ z 2 1 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ` 1 ´ a 2 ´ z 2 ˘ " 0.</formula><p>The last equation trivially holds true, which proves that if r " 1, then y ´ " y ` . Note that this is true regardless of the value of z: if z ă z crit , then y ´ " y ` ă ´b (no real solution for x, no intersection points); if z " z crit , then y ´ " y ` " ´b (touching in a single point with x " 0, quadruple root); and if z ă z crit , then y ´ " y ` ą ´b (touching at two points, multiple roots each, like on Figures 6.14 and 6.15), as seen from Ineqalities (6.15-6.18).

It is the Bond albedo, defined as the reflected fraction of incident electromagnetic power, that determines how much of this irradiation contributes to the thermal balance of the planet. Atmospheric temperature, in turn, determines -for a given composition -the presence and position of absorbers, clouds and other structures determining the albedo. Once the albedo is inferred from observations, the goal is to find a self-consistent atmospheric model and temperature. Even though it is the Bond albedo that can be used directly in the calculation of effective temperature, the geometric albedo A g is more accessible observationally. It is defined as the ratio of reflected flux at opposition (zero phase angle) to the reflected flux by a hypothetical flat, fully reflecting, diffusely scattering (Lambertian) surface of the same cross-section at the same position. The geometric albedo of Lambertian surfaces is at most one: for example, a fully reflecting Lambertian sphere has a geometric albedo of 2 3 (Hanel et al., 1992). However, some surfaces reflect light preferentially in the direction where it came from (a phenomenon known as opposition surge), and thus can exhibit geometric albedos exceeding one (e.g. Hapke, 1990).</figDesc></figure>

We therefore calculate the scatter per data point for all twelve possible combinations of omitting the first orbit or not, omitting the first or first two exposures of each orbit or not, and omitting the last exposure of each orbit or not. Comparing these results, we find that both for the analysis of HAT-P-1b only and for relative photometry using the reference star, it justified to omit the first orbit of each visit and the first exposure of each subsequent orbit, but not more, consistently with Sing et al.

It is interesting to note that these observations were originally proposed for the grism instrument ACS/HRC, which has a total throughput of 0.15-0.25 in this wavelength range, as opposed to 0.04-0.08 for STIS with the G750L grating. Thus ACS/HRC observations would have resulted in roughly three times more photons. Assuming the same u other and u param values, this approximately translates to a u total of 0.12 instead of 0.15 for the 1σ limit, and 0.43 instead of 0.54 for 2σ.

Late type main sequence stars are too small to cause a transit detectable from the ground in an AGN with black hole mass Á 10 5 M d , unless they are "bloated" by irradiation of the AGN (Lohfink et al., 2012). High photometric and temporal resolution observations of AGN stellar transits have the potential to map the accretion disk structure with an unprecedented accuracy. Stars are optically thick in all electromagnetic bands, and unlike broad line region clouds (e.g. Maiolino et al., 2010), they have a simple spherical geometry, making it easier to interpret lightcurves and to reconstruct the image of the accretion disk along the transit chord (projected stellar trajectory). Furthermore, such transits offer unique observations of individual stars in distant galaxies. Detections of multiple transits could reveal valuable information on the number density of stellar cusp central regions.</figDesc></figure>

Stars captured and transported inwards by the accretion disk may serve to fuel the AGN (Miralda-Escudé &amp; Kollmeier, 2005). In the Galaxy, Eisenhauer et al. (2005) report the orbital parameters of six B type main sequence stars orbiting the central SMBH on highly eccentric orbits with semi-major axes less than 16 mpc " 10 5 R g . These stars may be remnants of stellar binaries tidally disrupted by the SMBH, as first proposed by Hills (1988) (see also Yu &amp; Tremaine, 2003). Candidates for the binary counterparts ejected with high velocity have been identified by Brown et al. (2009). Bartko et al. (2009) find more than a hundred O and WR stars further from the Galactic Center, within 1 pc " 5 ˆ 10 6 R g projected distance. About one half of them is orbiting the central SMBH in a disc-like structure (the so-called clockwise disc), while the other half is on apparently randomly oriented orbits. These stars could have formed in a massive self-gravitating gaseous disk (e.g. Levin, 2007; Hobbs &amp; Nayakshin, 2009), or formed further away and captured in close orbits by the Hills (1988) mechanism or by a cluster of stellar mass black holes (Alexander &amp; Livio, 2004). Young stars could also be delivered to this region by an infalling globular cluster (Tremaine et al., 1975; Milosavljevi´cMilosavljevi´c &amp; Merritt, 2001). Most main sequence stars in the vicinity of a SMBH eventually evolve into red giants or supergiants, our candidates for transiting the AGN. Many such giants have been observed within 1 pc of the Galactic Center (e.g. Genzel et al., 2010; Paumard et al., 2006; Bartko et al., 2009, 2010). The fraction of stars in the giant phase within a stellar population depends strongly on its initial mass function (IMF) and formation history.</figDesc></figure>

Even if stars are formed on an orbit coplanar with the accretion disk, Rauch &amp; Tremaine (1996) provide a relaxation mechanism that could rapidly randomize the orbital orientations. The possible presence of intermediate mass black holes may help catalyze this process (Gualandris &amp; Merritt, 2009). And even if stars cluster in disks, this coherent behaviour averages out when observing multiple galactic cores as long as the stellar disks and the accretion disks have independent orientations.</figDesc></figure>

Analytical and numerical investigations of multiple mass populations show that the distribution for each mass bin is still likely to follow a power law. The value of α is predicted to be smaller (down to « 1.3) for lower mass stars (Bahcall &amp; Wolf, 1977; Freitag et al., 2006; Hopman &amp; Alexander, 2006). For massive stars representing a small mass fraction in the stellar cluster, α can be between 2 and 2.75 (Alexander &amp; Hopman, 2009), or as large as 3 (Keshet et al., 2009). Observations of the Galaxy by Bartko et al. (2010) show that WR/O stars from a distance of 30 mpc out to 600 mpc form an interesting anisotropic structure called the clockwise disk in the Galacit nucleus. These stars are distributed with a density exponent α " 2.4 ˘ 0.2, while the B star population from 30 mpc to 1 pc exhibits α " 2.5 ˘ 0.2. Note, however, that the age of main sequence O stars and WR stars is less than the two-body relaxation time " 0.1-1 Gyr at r " 100 mpc (O'Leary et al., 2009), therefore they are not expected to represent the equilibrium state. The observed mass distribution of solar mass stars in the Galactic nucleus is fit by a broken power law with α " 1.2 and 1.75 inside and outside of 0.22 pc, respectively (Schödel et al., 2007).</figDesc></figure>

Transit depth is defined as the blocked flux to out-of-transit flux ratio in a given band. Therefore the transit depth is between zero and one: zero if the transiting object does not cover any part of the accretion disk; one if the object completely blocks radiation (in which case it is called an occultation or eclipse). The transit depth varies with frequency and the location of the transiting object in projection. To be able to efficiently calculate transit depths at different positions, we implement a linear approximation to the radius-gravitational redshift grid generated by the above code to determine these values for a light ray parametrized by its projected position far from the AGN. Then we employ high order numerical approximation 2 to integrate over the stellar disk in the projection plane. This gives the blocked specific flux, which we then divide by the total specific flux to obtain the narrow-band transit depth. In addition to AGN spectra, Figure 4.1 also depicts the maximum possible narrow- band transit depth caused by an early type main sequence star with R ‹ " 11 R d as a function of frequency. The maximum depth of a general transit can be smaller if the star does not transit the most luminous part of the projected accretion disk. At high frequencies, the most luminous region is more compact, therefore the transit is deeper. The transit depth becomes constant at infrared frequencies less than the peak frequency of a black body spectrum with temperature of the outer edge of the disk (we</figDesc></figure>

The spatial variations in the transit depth maps imply time-variations of the observed AGN brightness as a transiting object moves across the image. A transit lightcurve corresponds to the values along the projected stellar trajectory in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. Conversely, observations of the transit lightcurve can be used to reveal the geometry of the accretion disk along a line in this image. The maximum possible resolution of such a reconstructed image is set by the size of the transiting object and the spatial variations of the disk brightness. Since the disk temperature increases inwards, the emission at higher frequencies is confined to the innermost regions, implying that transit measurements at higher frequencies can give a higher resolution image (see different panels in Figures 4.2 and 4.3). Transits of smaller objects also yield a higher resolution image. However, transits of smaller objects are less deep and hence more difficult to detect. The left-right asymmetry in the figure is due to different Doppler shifts for regions of the disk moving towards or away from the observer. The spacetime geometry leaves an imprint on the image, the top half of the disk image is distorted by gravitational lensing close to the BH. Remarkably, the black hole silhouette (i.e., the lack of emission within the ISCO) becomes directly visible in the X-ray image of a transiting O star (see Figure 4.2 bottom panel). The transit depth map is also sensitive to the spacetime geometry both directly through gravitational lensing and indirectly through the change in the ISCO radius.</figDesc></figure>

These observations are consistent with the damped random walk model of AGN variability (Kelly et al., 2009). Substituting a timescale of 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week into this relation yields an average AGN variability of 0.0018, 0.007, and 0.017 magnitudes in the optical g band, which corresponds to a variability of 0.17%, 0.7%, and 1.6% over these timescales, respectively. Comparing this to the AGN transit lightcurve on Figure 4.5 for transiting giants shows that the transit can cause a larger change in luminosity than the average intrinsic optical AGN variability, provided that the observation cadence is at most a few days. Thus we conclude that red giant transits may be detectable even in typically variable AGN. However, AGN variability may be a limitation for detecting transiting O stars in the optical bands, where the transit depth is much smaller.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_50"><head>Future</head><label></label><figDesc>ground-based optical surveys of larger collecting area might have an even better chance to detect transits of 10 6 M d active SMBHs. For example, LSST is a survey telescope with an equivalent primary mirror diameter of 6.68 m, and a field of view of 9.6 deg 2 , currently in design and development phase (LSST Science Collaborations et al., 2009). It is planned to have an observing strategy similar to that of Pan-STARRS, but with 3.4 times the collecting area of the four Pan-STARRS units in total, it can survey an approximately 3.4 3{2 « 6 times larger volume, increasing the transit detection expectation accordingly. Therefore we estimate that LSST may detect " 100 transits per decade for M SMBH " 10 6 M d . Also, since LSST is planned to have more frequent visits than Pan-STARRS, the intrinsic variability will have a smaller amplitude between subsequent observations. Since many survey telescopes devote a certain fraction of their time to deeper surveys of smaller areas, it is worth estimating how this changes the expected number of transit detections. Recall that the four Pan-STARRS units will be able to scan the entire night sky approximately once a week in five filters with « 40 second exposures. Now assume a single Pan-STARRS class instrument spends all available time on surveying an n times smaller area in g filter only, with m visits per week to fight AGN variability, thus exposing n{m times longer. As long as the observations are photon noise limited and cosmological effects are negligible, this strategy increases the surveyed volume, and also the expected number of transit detections, by a factor of n 1{2 m ´3{2 . For example, daily visits (m " 7) of an n « 1300 smaller area (a few fields) would mean two hour exposures per pointing, and would double the expected transit detections around M SMBH " 10 6 M d AGNs to " 2-4 per year, with increased robustness against intrinsic variability.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_54"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>transit probabilities are typical of all inclinations. However, note that larger inclination results in a thinner image of the accretion disk, therefore deeper transits. A disk with thickness H{R « 0.05 observed from a nearly edge-on orientation results in a " 10 times deeper transit, leading to a 10 3 times larger detectable volume for photon noise limited surveys. On the other hand, there are selection effects at both inclination extrema: a coplanar torus might obscure thermal emission from edge-on AGNs, whereas jets along the rotational axis might contaminate the lightcurve of face-on AGNs and prevent transits from being detected. These are likely to confine the inclination distribution of AGNs with observable thermal radiation closer to the average values we use in our model. Intrinsic AGN variability will pose a challenge to identifying AGN transits. For-tunately, optical AGN variability is small on the timescales of days, and thus does not rule out the possibility of transit observations for giant stars. With Pan-STARRS observations, however, the variability level at typical observation cadence is comparable to the transit depth. Transits might not be detected if the weekly observations miss the deepest part. Simultaneous multiband observation campaigns can help distinguish variability from transit signiture, as the transit lightcurve is predicted to have a different shape in different frequency bands. Also, transit lightcurves could be contaminated by the flux reflected by clouds surrounding the AGN. Multi-wavelength campaigns following AGN for these types of events may give information about the reflecting fraction, which could allow to constrain the covering fraction of material, the location and relative sizes of the reflecting regions. Future detectors could distinguish the reflected component using polarimetry.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_55"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Many stars have been observed to exhibit photometric variations synchronous to the orbit of their close planet. When these variations are attributed to photospheric features rotating with the stellar surface, this implies a synchronicity between stellar rotation and planetary orbit. One of the earliest robust detections of this phenomenon is by Walker et al. (2008) in the system τ Boo. They report on periodic photometric variations of the host star with a period within 0.04% of that of the planetary orbit, and they attribute this to an active region on the surface of the star. Similarly, stellar photometric variations synchronous to the planetary orbit have been detected for the planetary systems CoRoT-2 (Pagano et al., 2009; Lanza et al., 2009a) and CoRoT-4 (Lanza et al., 2009b). For all three stars, the rotation period inferred from spectroscopy is consistent with the period of photometric variations, indicating that the variations are due to photospheric features stationary on the stellar surface. Another interesting example is Kepler-13. Szabó et al. (2012) measure the rotational period of the star by frequency analysis of the spot-modulated lightcurve and find a 5:3 commensurability with the orbital period of the planet Kepler-13b at high significance.</figDesc></figure>

For both stars, we find two minima during most stellar rotations, indicating two large spots (or spot groups) at opposite longitudes. This structure is responsible for the spurious signal in the periodograms at half the rotation period, shown on Figures 5.1 and 5.2. On some other stars, this phenomenon might lead to incorrect identification of rotational periods (see, for example, Collier Cameron et al., 2009). We find a very stable phase in case of HAT-P-11 with the proposed stellar rotation period of six times the planetary orbital period, further supporting the proposed 6:1 commensurability (top panel). On the other hand, in case of Kepler-17, the phases of minima exhibit a large drift if we choose to calculate them with respect to eight times the planetary orbital period as the stellar rotation period (middle panel). This phase drift indicates that the real rotational period is different from what we used to calculate the phases. Indeed, we use the period 12.01 days as suggested by Bonomo &amp; Lanza (2012) to recalculate the phases, and we confirm that this yields phases of the minima 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 time (BKJD)</figDesc></figure>

To facilitate analysis of this phenomenon, we present spotrod, a model for planetary transits of stars with an arbitrary limb darkening law and a number of homogeneous, circular spots on their surface.

This argument is expected to hold for spots centered on the transit chord, for which the spot radius directly determines the occulted area.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_94"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>To investigate the radius and flux ratio distribution of spots, we plot the median of these parameters in increasing order on Figure 6.7. The top panel presents spot radius, the bottom shows flux ratio. The horizontal axes indicate the rank of the spot in the order of median values. In addition to the median, we shade the 1σ and 3σ intervals of the parameter distribution of each individual spot. The advantage of this presentation over the histograms of Figure 6.6 is that we can disentangle the spread of a spot parameter for an individual spot due to uncertainties from the spread of the ensemble distribution due to spots being different. Together with the histograms of Figure 6.6, Figure 6.7 helps us confirm the obser- vational biases agains small size and large flux ratio. In addition, we note that most spots are smaller than a « 0.15 (three times the radius of HAT-P-11b), with very few spots around the size of a « 0.2. We believe that larger spots are artifacts, because they are only seen with y different from b.</figDesc></figure>

Consequently, we now know a lot of tightly packed systems like the six planets of Kepler-11 (Lissauer et al., 2011), as well as some transiting planets with very long orbital periods, like Kepler-47c with 303.2 days (Orosz et al., 2012), although the low geometrical transit probability hides most long period planets from transiting surveys.</figDesc></figure>

Since then, two other papers on HST observations of the same target appeared in the literature: Wakeford et al. (2013) use the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument to observe in the wavelength range of 1.087-1.678 µm, and find a strong water absorption feature. Nikolov et al. (2014) observe with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph in wavelengths ranging from 0.29 to 1.027 µm, and find strong sodium absorption. Combining the two sets of observations, they suggest an overabundance of sodium, and hypothesize the presence of an absorber at high altitudes. They exclude the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, consistent with our findings in Chapter 3.</figDesc></figure>

We performed the calculations for the two visits separately, and also for a joint model,</head><label>3</label><figDesc></figDesc><table>where a single geometric albedo value was fit for the two visits, but we allowed for 

different coefficients of the detrending vectors for the two visits. The upper limits 

highlight the weakness of detrending: the 2σ upper limit based on the first visit data is 

meaningless (greater than one), and even worse, the limit based on the second visit data 

only is unphysical (negative). The reason for this is that the detrending vectors are not 

orthogonal to the occultation signal, that is, systematic effects have a component that 

mimics the occultation lightcurve. Therefore even though detrending is justified by the 

Bayesian Information Criterion, it introduces a bias in the geometric albedo values. 

On the other hand, if we feed the flux ratio of the planetary host star HAT-P-1 

and the reference star ADS 16402 A into the occultation lightcurve model, much less 

detrending is justified, thus we expect less bias in the result. Indeed, Table 3.3 shows 

that the results from the two visits are much closer to each other, and all upper limits 

are positive. Even though the uncertainties in the two cases are very similar, as we can 

tell by comparing values in Tables 3.2 and 3.3, in the second case, this is achieved by 

using only one detrending vector instead of four. This shows the enormous advantage 

of the reference star: to diminish the need for detrending, therefore arrive at similar 

uncertainties with much less bias. We adopt the upper limits of the joint fit as our final 

result.
