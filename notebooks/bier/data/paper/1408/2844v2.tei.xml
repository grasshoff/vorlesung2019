				<p>Aims. With the purpose of determining the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems from observational data, we have developed a software, named TRADES (TRAnsits and Dynamics of Exoplanetary Systems), to simultaneously fit observed radial velocities and transit times data. Methods. We implemented a dynamical simulator for N-body systems, which also fits the available data during the orbital integration and determines the best combination of the orbital parameters using grid search, χ 2 minimization, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and bootstrap analysis. Results. To validate TRADES, we tested the code on a synthetic three-body system and on two real systems discovered by the Kepler mission: Kepler-9 and Kepler-11. These systems are good benchmarks to test multiple exoplanet systems showing transit time variations (TTVs) due to the gravitational interaction among planets. We have found that orbital parameters of Kepler-11 planets agree well with the values proposed in the discovery paper and with a a recent work from the same authors. We analyzed the first three quarters of Kepler-9 system and found parameters in partial agreement with discovery paper. Analyzing transit times (T 0 s), covering 12 quarters of Kepler data, that we have found a new best-fit solution. This solution outputs masses that are about 55% of the values proposed in the discovery paper; this leads to a reduced semi-amplitude of the radial velocities of about 12.80 ms −1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Now, more than 1779 planets <ref type="bibr">1</ref> have been discovered and confirmed in about 1102 planetary systems. Around 460 planetary systems are known to be multiple planet systems. Hundreds of Kepler planetary candidates with multiple transit-like signals are still waiting confirmation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Latham et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lissauer et al. 2011b</ref>). The usual way to characterize multiple planet systems is by combining information from both transits and radial velocities (RVs). An effect due to the presence of multiple planets is the transit time variation (TTV): the gravitational interaction between two planets causes a deviation from the Keplerian orbit and, as a consequence, the transit times (T 0 s) of a planet may be not strictly periodic (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holman &amp; Murray 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Miralda-Escudé 2002)</ref>. This effect can be also exploited to infer the presence of an unknown planet, even if it does not transit the host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holman &amp; Murray 2005)</ref>. For example, the Kepler Transit Timing Observations series (TTO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ford et al. 2011</ref>, and references therein) and TASTE project ( <ref type="bibr">Nascimbeni et al. 2011</ref>, and references therein) demonstrate the use of this technique.</p><p>The problem of determining the masses and the orbital parameters of the planets in a multiple system is a difficult inverse problem. In some works, the authors adopted an analytic approach to the problem (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nesvorný &amp; Morbidelli 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nesvorný 2009</ref>), developing a method from the perturbation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hori 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Deprit 1969)</ref>, where the T 0 s are computed as a Fourier series. A drawback of this method is that it does not take into account for the so-called mean motion resonance (MMR) or cases that are just outside the MMR. We have a MMR when the ratio of the periods of two planets is a multiple of a small integer number, such as 2:1. Two planets reciprocally in MMR, or just outside it, show a strong TTV signal that is easily detectable even with ground-base facilities. The method described in this paper is based on a direct numerical N-body approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agol &amp; Steffen 2007)</ref>, which is conceptually simpler, but computationally intensive. Very recently, <ref type="bibr">Deck et al. (2014)</ref> have developed TTVFast, a symplectic integrator that computes transit times and radial velocities of an exoplanetary system. An example of the application based on the TTV technique can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nesvorný et al. (2013)</ref>, where the authors have predicted the presence of the planet KOI-142c in the system, which has been recently confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barros et al. (2013)</ref>.</p><p>In Sect. 2 we introduce the TRADES program, the basic formulas, and methods to calculate radial velocities and transit times; in Sects. 3, 4, and 5, we run TRADES on a synthetic 3-body system, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-11, and Kepler-9,</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TRADES</head><p>We have developed a computer program (in Fortran 90 and openMP) for determining the possible physical and dynamical configurations of extra-solar planetary systems from observational data, known as TRADES, which stands for TRAnsits and Dynamics of Exoplanetary Systems. The program TRADES models the dynamics of multiple planet systems and reproduces the observed transit times (T 0 , or mid-transit times) and radial velocities (RVs). These T 0 s and RVs are computed during the integration of the planetary orbits. We have developed TRADES from zero because we want to avoid black-box programs,it would be easier to parallelize it with openMP, and include additional algorithms.</p><p>To solve the inverse problem, TRADES can be run in four different modes: 1) 'grid' search, 2) Levenberg-Marquardt 2 (LM) algorithm, 3) genetic algorithm (GA, we used the implementation named PIKAIA 3 , Charbonneau 1995), 4) and particle swarm optimization (PSO 4 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tada 2007)</ref>. In each mode, TRADES compares observed transit times (T 0,obs s) and radial velocities (RV obs s) with the simulated ones (T 0,sim s and RV sim s).</p><p>1. In the grid search method, TRADES samples the orbital elements of a perturbing body in a four-dimensional grid: the mass, M, the period, P (or the semi-major axis, a), the eccentricity, e, and the argument of the pericenter, ω. The grid parameters can be evenly sampled on a fixed grid by setting the number of steps, or the step size, or by a number of points chosen randomly within the parameter bounds. For any given set of values, the orbits are integrated, and the residuals between the observed and computed T 0 s and RVs are computed. For each combination of the parameters, the LM algorithm can be called and the best case is the one with the lowest residuals (lowest χ 2 ). We have selected these four parameters for the grid search because they represent the minimal set of parameters required to model a coplanar system. In the future, we intend to add the possibility of making the grid search over all the set of parameters for each body. 2. After an initial guess on the orbital parameters of the perturber, which could be provided by the previously described grid approach, the LM algorithm exploits the LevenbergMarquardt minimization method to find the solution with the lowest residuals. The LM algorithm requires the analytic derivative of the model with respect to the parameters to be fitted. Since the T 0 s are determined by an iterative method and the radial velocities are computed using the numerical integrator, we cannot express these as analytic functions of fitting parameters. We have adopted the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moré et al. (1980)</ref> to compute the Jacobian matrix, which is determined by a forward-difference approximation. The epsfcn parameter, which is the parameter that determines the first Jacobian matrix, is automatically selected in a logarithmic range from the machine precision up to 10 −6 ; the best value is the one that returns the lower χ 2 . This method has the advantage to be scale invariant, but it assumes that each parameter is varied by the same epsfcn value (e.g., a variation of 10% of the period has a different effect than a variation of the same percentage of the argument of pericenter  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holland 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goldberg 1989)</ref>, where the fitness parameter is set to the inverse of the χ 2 . This algorithm is inspired by natural selection which is the biological process of evolution. Each generation is a new population of 'offspring' orbital configurations, that are the result of 'parent' pairs of orbital configurations that are ranked following the fitness parameter. A drawback of the GA is the slowness of the algorithm, when compared to other optimizers. However, the GA should converge to a global solution (if it exists) after the appropriate number of iterations. 4. The PSO is another optimization algorithm that searches for the global solution of the problem; this approach is inspired by the social behavior of bird flock and fish school (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kennedy &amp; Eberhart 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eberhart 2007</ref>). The fitness parameter used is the same as the GA, the inverse of the χ 2 . For each 'particle', the next step (or iteration) in the space of the fitted parameters is mainly given by the combination of three terms: random walk, best 'particle' position (combination of parameters), and best 'global' position (best orbital configuration of the all particles and all iterations).</p><p>The grid search is a good approach in case that we want to explore a limited subset of the parameter space or if we want to analyze the behavior of the system by varying some parameters, for example to test the effects of a growing mass for the perturbing planet. GA and PSO are good methods to be used in case of a wider space of parameters. The orbital solution determined with the GA or the PSO method is eventually refined with the LM mode.</p><p>For each mode, TRADES can perform a bootstrap analysis to calculate the interval of confidence of the best-fit parameter set. We generate a set of T 0 s and RVs from the fitted parameters, and we add a Gaussian noise having the calculated value (of T 0 s and RVs) as the mean and the corresponding measurement error as variance. We fit each new set of observables with the LM. We iterate the whole process thousands of times to analyze the distribution for each fitted parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Orientation of the reference frame</head><p>For the transit time determination, the propagation of the trajectories of all planets in the system is performed in a reference frame with the Z-axis pointing to the observer, while the X-Y plane is the sky plane. At a given reference epoch, the Keplerian orbital elements of each planet are: period P (or semi-major axis a), inclination i, eccentricity e, argument of the pericenter ω, longitude of the ascending node Ω, and time of the passage at the pericenter τ (or the mean anomaly M). Given the orbital elements we first compute the initial radius r and velocity ˙ r vectors in the orbital plane (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r =        </formula><p>The same rotations have to be applied to the initial velocity vector. The inclinations are measured from the sky-plane. Indeed, a planet with inclination of 0 • has an orbit that lies on the skyplane (X-Y plane), that is, it is seen face-on. The orbit of a planet with i = 90 • is seen edge-on (it transits exactly through the center of the star), and it lies on the X-Z plane. From the initial state vector, TRADES integrates the astrocentric equation of motion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Murray &amp; Dermott 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fabrycky 2011</ref>) of planet k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¨ r k = −G (M 1 + M k ) r k r 3 k + G N j=2; jk M j        r j − r k |r j − r k | 3 − r j r 3 j        ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where M 1 is the mass of the star and N the number of bodies; the first term is the direct gravitational force, and the second term is the indirect force due to mutual interaction of the planets. The orbits are computed with the Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp integrator <ref type="bibr">(RKCK, Cash &amp; Karp 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Press et al. 1996</ref>). It is not a symplectic integrator <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , and it is not well suited for long-term time integrations. Instead, it uses small and variable steps (it self adjusts the step-size to maintain the numerical precision during the computation of the orbits), is fast, and preserves the total energy and the total angular momentum during the time scales of our simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Transit determination</head><p>We chose the change of sign of the X or Y coordinates between two consecutive steps of each planet trajectory as first condition of an eclipse. When this condition is met, following Fabrycky (2011, chap. 2.5), we have to seek roots of the sky-projected separation r s,k ≡ (X k , Y k ) with the Newton-Raphson method by solving</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g(X k , ˙ X k , Y k , ˙ Y k ) = r s,k · ˙ r s,k = X k ˙ X k + Y k ˙ Y k = 0<label>(5)</label></formula><p>then moving and iterating by the quantity,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">δt = −g ∂g ∂t −1 .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In this way, we can determine with high precision the mid-transit time and the corresponding state vector (r mid , ˙ r mid ) with an accuracy equal to the selected δt. We decided to set this accuracy in TRADES at the machine precision, which can be fine-tuned in the source of the code and defines the type of the chosen variables.</p><p>Then, we determine if we have four contact times, or just two (in the case of a grazing eclipse), or no transit, comparing the module of the sky-projected separation at the transit time, |r s,mid |, with the radius of the star, R , and of the planets, R k , as in Fabrycky <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref>. If the transit (or the occultation) does exist, we move about R /|˙ r s,mid | from the t mid backward (−) for first and second contact, and forward (+) for third and fourth contact. Then, we solve</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h(X k , Y k ) = ˙ X 2 k + X k ¨ X k + ˙ Y 2 k + Y k ¨ Y k = 0<label>(7)</label></formula><p>and move of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">δt = −h ∂h ∂t −1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>until δt is less than the accuracy found (the same adopted in finding the transit time). We based our approach on Fabrycky (2011), but we used a bisection-Newton-Raphson hybrid method, which is guaranteed to be bound near the solution, and we assume that the orbital elements of the bodies are almost constant around the center of the transit. Because of the latter assumption, we use F(t i , t i−1 ) and G(t i , t i−1 ) functions (called f (t, t 0 ) and g(t, t 0 ) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Danby 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref> to compute the planetary state vectors instead of the integrator while seeking the transit times:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r i (t) = F(t i , t i−1 )r i−1 + G(t i , t i−1 )˙ r i−1 ˙ r i (t) = ˙ F(t i , t i−1 )r i−1 + ˙ G(t i , t i−1 )˙ r i−1<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r i−1 = r(t i−1 ) ˙ r i−1 = ˙ r(t i−1 )<label>(10)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F(t i , t i−1 ) = a i r i−1 [cos(E i − E i−1 ) − 1] + 1 G(t i , t i−1 ) = (t i − t i−1 ) + 1 n i [sin(E i − E i−1 ) − (E i − E i−1 )] (11) and        ˙ F(t i , t i−1 ) = − a 2 i r i r i−1 n i sin(E i − E i−1 ) ˙ G(t i , t i−1 ) = a i r i [cos(E i − E i−1 ) − 1] + 1 .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where t i = t i−1 + δt i−1 at the i-th iterations; E i and E i−1 are the eccentric anomalies at the i-th and i-th−1 iterations. This allows the code to run faster than using the integrator, which has a lower number of function calls, to seek the transit and contact times. The light coming from the star is delayed due to the motion of the star around the barycenter of the system (Irwin 1952), and so TRADES corrects for the light-time travel effect (LTE = −Z barycentric /c, see Fabrycky 2011), each contact, and center transit time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">RV calculation and other constraints</head><p>For each observed RV (when available), TRADES integrates the orbits of the planets to the instant of the RV point and calculates the RV as the opposite of the z-component of the barycentric velocity of the star (rv sim = − ˙ Z barycentric in the right unit of measurement). The observed RV is defined as RV obs = γ + rv obs , where γ is the motion of the barycenter of the system and rv obs is the reflex motion of the star induced by the planets. The program TRADES calculates γ sim as the weighted mean of the difference ∆rv j = RV j,obs − rv j,sim with j from one to the number of Article number, page 3 of 14 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. LucaBorsato_trades01_AA201424080</p><p>RVs. The final simulated RV is RV j,sim = γ sim + rv j,sim . We are planning to implement the γ sim fitting rather than the described weighted mean method.</p><p>Furthermore, we added some constraints on the orbit during the integration, setting a minimum and a maximum semi-majoraxis for the system, a min and a max , respectively. The lower limit has been set equal to the star radius, while the maximum limit has been set equal to five times the largest semi-major axis of the system calculated from the periods of the planets. In the GA, we have used the largest period boundary. We use the definition of the Hill's sphere to obtain minimum distance allowed between two planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Murray &amp; Dermott 2000)</ref>. In this case, when these constraints are not be respected, the integration is stopped, and the χ 2 returned is set to the maximum value allowed by the compiler, so the combination of the parameters is rejected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Validation with simulated system</head><p>To validate TRADES, we simulated a synthetic system with two planets having known orbital parameters. We chose a star with a mass and radius equal to the Sun, a first planet named b with Jupiter mass and radius (M Jup and R Jup ), and a second planet named c with mass and radius of Saturn (M Sat and R Sat ). We assumed a co-planar system with inclination of 90 • (perfectly edge-on). The input orbital elements of the system are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Parameters of the simulated system in section 3.</p></div>

We computed all T 0 s for each body and we call these times the 'true' transit times (T 0,true s) of the system. Then, we created sets of synthetic transit times (T 0,synth s), such as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">T 0,synth = T 0,true + N(0, 1) × P 3 × s ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where s is a scaling factor varying from 0.01 to 1.5 (on twenty logarithmic steps) needed to simulate good to very bad measurement cases; N(0, 1) is Gaussian noise with 0 as mean and 1 as variance. The P/3 factor is needed to scale the Gaussian noise in the right unit of time, and avoids confusion between transits and occultations at the same time. Furthermore, for each set of T 0,synth s, we selected a random number of transits (at least N/3 with N being the total number of transits of each planet) to simulate observed transits. We fixed the orbital parameters of planet b, and we fitted M, P, e, ω, M, and Ω of planet c. We ran TRADES in LM mode for each scaling factor, and we calculated the difference of the parameters (∆) as the determined parameters minus the input parameters. We repeated the simulation ten times (we calculated new Gaussian noise and the number of observed times every time). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, we plotted then mean and median of ten simulations for each s scaling factor value. The parameters of the system derived by TRADES depart from the 'true' values only for extremely large measurement errors.</p><p>To further test the robustness of the algorithm, we took the T 0,true s (without added noise) and varied the initial semi-major axis of planet c from 0.19 AU to 0.21 AU with the TRADES grid+LM mode by fitting the same parameters of the previous test. The algorithm nicely converged to the values from which the synthetic data were generated, except for initial parameters that are too far from the right solution. This is due to the known limitation of the LM algorithm, which converges to close local minima from an initial set of parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the variation of the parameter differences (∆) as function of the initial semi-major axis. This test shows how well TRADES recovers the parameters in the case of a bad guess of the initial parameters.</p><p>We measured the computational time required by TRADES, and we found that it can integrate (initial step size of 0.0001 day) a 3-body synthetic system for 3000 days writing the orbits, the Keplerian elements, and the constants of motion for each 0.1 days in about 2.3 seconds. An integration of 1000 days has been performed in less than 1 second and in less than half second for 500 days of integration time, but most of the time have been spent writing files. We want to stress that TRADES write these files only at the end of the simulations, so the real computation is faster than these estimates. The time required by TRADES to complete the grid search was about 51 minutes with 10 processors of an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 based workstation. For each combination of the initial parameters in the grid search, TRADES runs 10 times the LM to select the best value for the parameter epsfcn, that is needed to construct the initial Jacobian.</p><p>We tested the PSO+LM algorithm by fitting the same parameters of the grid search with limited boundaries except for the semi-major axis of planet c, for which we used the same limit of the grid search (a c = [0. <ref type="bibr">19</ref>   <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> used to generate the exact transit times. The goodness of the fit has been color-coded so that good fits (χ 2 r &lt; 10) have been plotted as blue points and bad fits (χ 2 r &gt; 10) as open circles. The small gaps are due to the random sampling used to generate the grid in the semi-major axis a.</p><p>times with 200 particles for 2000 iterations, and TRADES always returned the right parameter values in less than about 1 hour and 40 minutes with 10 processors.</p></div>

From the spectroscopic analysis of HIRES high-resolution spectra, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lissauer et al.

We used this model because the authors did not provide any information about the mean anomalies (or the time of the passage at the pericenter) for those planets. In this case, the argument of the pericenter, ω, is undetermined, so we fixed it to ω = 90 • for each planet. We then calculated the initial mean anomaly, M 0 at the reference epoch t epoch = 2 455 190.0 (BJD UTC 6 ), setting the transit time (T 0 , Lis- -0.500 0.000 0.500</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X [AU]</formula><p>-0.500 0.000 0.500 <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.

Hereafter, the orbital solution we have determined with TRADES is named with a short ID of the system (K11 for Kepler-11 and K9 for Kepler-9) and a Roman number (K11-I, K11-II, and so on). See solution K11-I in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for a summary of the parameters determined with TRADES (with 2σ confidence intervals from bootstrap analysis), which agree with those published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lissauer et al. (2011a)</ref>. For each bootstrap run, we run 1000 iterations to obtain the confidence intervals at the 97.72 percentile (2σ) of the distribution of each parameter. We calculated the residuals as the difference between the observed and simulated T 0 s. The residuals after the TRADES-LM fit are smaller than those with simulated transit times, that obtained with original parameters, and the final χ 2 r is around ≈ 88 degrees of freedom (dof, calculated as the difference between the number of data and the number of fitted parameters). We also used the same initial conditions of solution K11-I, but this time we fitted the eccentricity and the argument of pericenter of all the planets. In this case, the LM did not move from the initial conditions even if it properly ended the simulation and returned reasonable errors. In the user guide of MINPACK ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Moré et al. 1980</ref>), the user is warned to carefully analyze the case in which one has a null initial parameter. We set the initial eccentricities to a small but non-zero value of 0.0001. This small change was able to let the LM algorithm to properly return reasonable parameter values; see solution K11-II in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for a summary of the parameters.</p><p>The resulting masses of the solutions K11-I and K11-II all agree within 2σ with the discovery paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>) and with all the best-fit solutions determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Migaszewski et al. (2012)</ref>. In the latter work, the authors presented different sets of orbital parameters determined with an approach similar to ours (direct N-body simulation with genetic algorithm, Levenberg-Marquardt, and bootstrap), but they directly fit the flux of Kepler light curves (so-called dynamical photometric model) without fitting the transit times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Transit time analysis of the twelve quarters</head><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref> analyzed the transit times covering fourteen quarters of Kepler data (in long and short cadence mode). A new independent extraction of T 0 s from the light curves made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013,</ref> hereafter we call the dynamical model from this work Lis2013, see column five of Table 2) led the authors to change the value of some parameters of the system. For example, they determined a mass of 2.9 +2.9 −1.6 M ⊕ of the planet c that is lower than 15.82 ± 2.21 M ⊕ published in the discovery paper ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lissauer et al. 2011a</ref>). Unfortunately the authors have not published the T 0 , so we used the data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> that recently published the transit times for twelve quarters of the Kepler mission for 721 KOIs.</p><p>We used the linear ephemeris by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref> to compute the O − Cs for the T 0 s from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref>. We found a remarkable mismatch with the O−Cs plotted in the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref>. We stress that the T 0 s by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> are calculated with an automated algorithm. It would be advisable to more carefully analyze the light curves determining the T 0 s with higher precision, but it is not the purpose of this work. We analyzed the system with all transit times from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> without any selection, and they lead to unphysical results. We then decided to discard data with duration and depth of the transits that are 5σ away from the median values. This selection defines the sample of T 0 s for the first twelve quarters of Kepler-11 exoplanets on which we bases our next analysis.</p><p>We ran simulations with TRADES in grid+LM mode on twelve quarters with initial set of parameters as in K11-II; we fitted M, P, e, ω, and M of each planet (Ω = 0 • fixed for all the planets). In particular, we varied the mass of planet g from 1 M ⊕ to 100 M ⊕ with a logarithmic step (ten simulations including the boundaries of 1 and 100 M ⊕ ) in the grid. We repeated this set of simulations for three different initial values of the eccentricity: in the first sample, we set the initial eccentricity of all planets to 0.001; in the second sample this is equal to 0.1; and in the third sample, we used a different value of the eccentricity for each planet, which closer to the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref> ones: e b = 0.05, e c = 0.05, e d = 0.001, e e = 0.005, e f = 0.005, and e g = 0.1. With these simulations, we intended to test whether a forest of local minima are met during the search for the lowest χ 2 (see <ref type="figure">Figs. 4</ref>, 5, and 6). According to Figs. 4 and 5, this indeed seems to be the case significantly complicating the identification of the real minimum. The LM was not able to properly change the eccentricity of the planets that, which got stuck close to the initial value in the majority of the cases. Furthermore, when the initial eccentricity have been set to 0.1 the masses of planets d and f have decreased <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>) compared to those in the previous simulation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. Maybe, this could be an effect due to the particular sample of T 0 we used, so it would be interesting to re-estimate the T 0 from the light curves and re-analyze the system. However, all the simulations have a final χ 2 r of about 2 or lower; the ninth simulation of the third set is our best solution (hereafter K11-III, see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) with a χ 2 r = 1.8 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6</ref>). The resulting O−C diagrams of the best simulation are shown in Figs. 7 (planets b, c, and d) and 8 (planet e, f, and g). All the masses and the eccentricities of solution K11-III agree well with the values found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref>. Some of our simulations converged to parameter values, which are different from those proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, some simulations show very narrow confidence intervals. This could be due both to the high complexity of the problem and to a strong selection effect: the distribution of the parameters in the bootstrap analysis are strongly bounded to the parameter values found by the LM algorithm.</p><p>In <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, we report a brief summary of the main differences of the characteristics of the analysis that led us to each solution for the Kepler-11 system.</p></div>

The maximum absolute difference between the mid-transit times from TRADES and MERCURY (with RADAU15 and Hybrid integrator) is ∼ 0.16 seconds for an integration of 500 days. We did the calculation of the Keplerian orbital elements both for TRADES and MERCURY, and we verified the trend of the X coordinate (the coordinate used as alarm in case of eclipses for Kepler-9) of each planet as function of time (in a range of time around an observed transit): we did not find any difference or unexpected behavior between TRADES and MERCURY. These tests support our results showing that the problem is not in the integrator or in the subroutine used to calculate the transit times. Then, we fitted M, P, e, ω, and M (mean anomaly) of both planets and Ω of planet c using the LM algorithm in TRADES.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Transit time analysis of the twelve quarters</head><p>As for the Kepler-11 system, we extended the analysis of Kepler-9 to the first twelve quarters of Kepler data using the transit times from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al.

First of all, we extended the integration of the orbits of the planets from the solution K9-I to the twelve quarters (we did not fit any parameters in this simulation) and we compare the observed T 0 s and RVs with the simulated ones. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 11</ref> it is clear that the simulation diverges quite soon from the observations. We run a simulation with the MERCURY package with same initial parameters of TRADES, compared the resulting O − C diagrams, and we found the same behavior.

We set the parameters from solution K9-I as the initial parameters of each simulation. We had good fits up to the simulation with quarters 6, 7, and 8; the following simulations showed increased χ 2 r (&gt; 700) that dropped to ≈ 44 only for the last three moving simulation (quarters <ref type="bibr">10, 11, and 12)</ref>.

We chose to run many simulations with GA+LM and PSO+LM on all 12 quarters with and without fitting the RV points. We set quite wide bounds on the parameters; in particular, we set the masses to be bound between 10 −6 M Jup and 1 M Jup and the eccentricities between 0 and 0.3.

This solution has a χ 2 r of about 1.44 for 56 dof (summary of the final parameters in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). The masses of solution K9-II are about 55% of the masses published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holman et al. (2010)</ref>.

These small values of the masses and the eccentricities imply a RV semi-amplitude of about 16.11 ms −1 , which is smaller than the one from the solution K9-I (∼ 28.91 ms −1 ) that is extended to all 12 quarters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Summary</head><p>We have developed a program, TRADES, that simulates the dynamics of exoplanetary systems and that does a simultaneous fit of radial velocities and transit times data. Analyzing a simulated planetary system, we have shown that TRADES can determine the parameters even from low precision data or for a rough guess of the initial orbital elements.</p><p>We validated TRADES by reproducing the packed exoplanetary system Kepler-11. The orbital parameters we determined agree with the values of the discovery paper and the recent analysis of 14 quarters by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, our analysis agrees with the results by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Migaszewski et al. (2012)</ref> that used a similar approach. Our best simulation (K11-III) returned a value for the mass of the planet g of about 25 M ⊕ , which agrees within the error bars and the confidence interval proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref>. Furthermore, all our simulations showed a final χ 2 r 2, and the final mass of planet g agrees with the previous works.</p><p>We reproduced the Kepler-9 system (without KOI-377.03), and we found that the parameters from the SOM of the discovery paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Holman et al. 2010</ref>) cannot properly reproduce the O − C diagram of Kepler-9c. We tested the orbits and O − C diagrams with an independent program, MERCURY, and we found the same result. A difference of a few degrees in λ for both planets is enough to explain the offset of about 300 minutes in the O − C diagram. We found the same results after analyzing the T 0 s by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> that cover the same quarters of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holman et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Extending the analysis, we found that the original solution is not compatible to the whole set of data from the 12 quarters by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref>. It shows a divergence of the simulated O − C compared to the observed one <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 11)</ref>. The solution K9-I, as obtained with the same temporal baseline of the discovery paper cannot explain the observed transit time for the whole set of T 0 s. Only using the combination of a 'quasi' global optimized search algorithm, such as genetic PIKAIA or particle swarm (PSO), with the LM algorithm, it has been possible to improve the fit on all 12 quarters but only if we neglect the six RV points. With this approach, we have found a new solution (K9-II) with a χ 2 r ≈ 1.  <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> from the fit of the T 0 s for the 12 quarters and neglecting the six RV points. Colors and markers as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 12</ref> χ 2 r ≈ 1.44 for 56 dof. In the bottom panel, the RV model (blue dots) from the solution K9-II with over plotted RV observations (black dots with error-bars). We do not have the RV residuals from TRADES, because we have not fitted the RVs. The RV model has a lower RV semi-amplitude of about 12.80 ms −1 with respect to the RVs from the discovery paper.</p><p>semi-amplitude of about 12.80 ms −1 if compared to the observations. We need to better study this system by, for example, obtaining more RV points because it can shed light on the issue of the different masses of the exoplanets calculated from RV data and from the TTV (for a similar case see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Masuda et al. 2013</ref>). Follow-up transit observations with CHEOPS will extend the time coverage and are advisable.</p><p>In both Kepler systems we carried out the analysis of twelve quarters using the transit times calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> using an automated algorithm. We point out that it would be advisable to analyze the light curves of the KOIs that show TTV signals and recompute the transit times of the planets in more detail.</p><p>It is known that the LM algorithm cannot return reliable errors (with physical meaning) in presence of correlated errors and complex parameter spaces. For some parameters, the bootstrap analysis returned small intervals of confidence. A possible explanation is that the parameter distributions in the bootstrap analysis are limited to values close to those found by the LM algorithm. This is probably due to a strong selection effect of the forest of minima in the χ 2 space. Furthermore, for the Kepler-9 case, the measurement errors have tiny effect compared to the TTV signal that dominates the distribution of the parameters.</p><p>In the near future, we add a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) algorithm (or an another Bayesian algorithm, e.g., multiNEST, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Feroz et al. 2009</ref>) in TRADES to perform parameter estimation and model selection using a Bayesian approach. The idea is to provide the initial parameters to the Bayesian algorithm via the LM algorithm or use a grid search. Furthermore, we plan to include the transit duration in the fitting procedure to put more constraint on the parameter determination.</p><p>Recently, the European Space Agency (ESA) adopted the space S-class mission CHEOPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broeg et al. 2013</ref>). The launch of this satellite is foreseen by December 2017. CHEOPS will characterize the structure of Neptune-and Earth-like exoplanets monitoring their transits. The CHEOPS targets will be stars hosting planets that are known via accurate Doppler and groundbased surveys. We plan to optimize TRADES for CHEOPS mission to dynamically characterize observed exoplanetary systems and to analyze possible TTV detections.</p><p>The work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazeh et al. (2013)</ref> provided a list of exoplanetary systems that show TTV signals. We are currently selecting a wide sample of these systems that would be suitable for an analysis with the program TRADES, such as Kepler-19. We plan to make a self-consistent analysis of the raw Kepler data, determine the transit times, and combine them with available RV data.</p><p>TRADES will be publicly release as soon as possible. Those interested can send an email to the first author of this work, and a copy of the code will be provided.

Variations (∆) of the fitted parameters for different initial values of the semi-major axis of the planet c; each point corresponds to a different simulation. In this case, the input parameters (of planet c) are the parameters in Table 1 used to generate the exact transit times. The goodness of the fit has been color-coded so that good fits (χ 2 r &lt; 10) have been plotted as blue points and bad fits (χ 2 r &gt; 10) as open circles. The small gaps are due to the random sampling used to generate the grid in the semi-major axis a.</figDesc></figure>
