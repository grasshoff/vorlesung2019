				<p>The Kepler mission has revolutionized our understanding of exoplanets, but some of the planet candidates identified by Kepler may actually be astrophysical false positives or planets whose transit depths are diluted by the presence of another star. Adaptive optics images made with ARIES at the MMT of 87 Kepler Objects of Interest place limits on the presence of fainter stars in or near the Kepler aperture. We detected visual companions within 1 ′′ for five stars, between 1 ′′ and 2 ′′ for seven stars, and between 2 ′′ and 4 ′′ for 15 stars. For those systems, we estimate the brightness of companion stars in the Kepler bandpass and provide approximate corrections to the radii of associated planet candidates due to the extra light in the aperture. For all stars observed, we report detection limits on the presence of nearby stars. ARIES is typically sensitive to stars approximately 5.3 Ks magnitudes fainter than the target star within 1 ′′ and approximately 5.7 Ks magnitudes fainter within 2 ′′ , but can detect stars as faint as ∆Ks = 7.5 under ideal conditions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Since launch in 2009, the Kepler mission has discovered 4234 planet candidates and confirmed or validated 977 planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borucki et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. , 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burke et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). Many of the planet candidates are expected to be bona fide planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Morton &amp; Johnson 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fressin et al. 2013</ref>), but a small fraction may actually be astrophysical false positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brown 2003</ref>) in which the apparent transit signal is produced by a pair of eclipsing stars physically associated with the target star (a hierarchical triple) or in the background of the target star (a background eclipsing binary). Close-in giant planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Santerne et al. 2012</ref>) and candidate planets around giant stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sliski &amp; Kipping 2014</ref>) are particularly likely to be false positives. In other cases, transit signals may be diluted due to the presence of other stars (physically associated or not) in the target aperture. This would cause the radius of the planet to be underestimated. Because Kepler has a relatively large plate scale of nearly 4 ′′ per pixel and many target apertures consist of multiple pixels, acquiring higher resolution follow-up imagery near planet host stars is crucial for untangling potentially blended systems.</p><p>In order to reduce the odds of classifying blended systems as planet candidates, the Kepler team performs a series of tests on Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) before nominating them to planet candidate status. The tests include comparing the depths of odd and even transits in order to identify stellar eclipses that have been misiden-tified as planetary transits, checking for ellipsoidal variations, and searching for secondary eclipses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batalha et al. 2010</ref>). Background eclipsing binaries can also be identified by examining the direction and magnitude of the shift in the photocenter during transit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>). Even systems in which the observed dip is due to a transit on the target star can have significant centroid motion in crowded fields. However, some background eclipsing binaries can be identified by computing the "source offset" between the target star and the transit source ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bryson et al. 2013</ref>). A dip due to a transit on the target star should have a negligible source offset while a dip due to a transit or eclipse of another star can result in a significant source offset depending on the angular separation and relative brightnesses of the true source and the target star.</p><p>An additional false positive check that can be performed using Kepler data alone consists of a comparison of the ephemeris of an identified transit signal to the ephemerides of known eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and other planet candidates. Using this method and supplementing Kepler data with additional catalogs of eclipsing binaries and variable stars, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> found that 12% of the KOIs they inspected were false positives due to contamination from other known sources. However, because Kepler does not downlink data for all stars in the field, some contaminated KOIs will not be revealed via ephemeris matching because the contaminating star will not be downloaded. Correcting for this effect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref> caution that 35% of KOIs may be false positives due to contamination.</p><p>In an ideal case, all planet candidates could be confirmed by obtaining radial velocity observations and measuring a mass for the transiting planet. However, this plan is logistically impossible due to the large number of planet candidates, the faint magnitudes of most Kepler host stars, and the small RV signature expected for most small planets. In many cases, we must therefore attempt to "validate" planet candidates by demonstrating that the odds that the transit signal is due to a bona fide transiting planet are much higher than the odds of a false positive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ballard et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cochran et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Torres et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fressin et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Borucki et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ford et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fressin et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref>; Morton 2012; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ballard et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lissauer et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rowe et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wang et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In order to validate planets and properly correct for diluted transits, we need to place limits on the presence of other stars close to the target. The Kepler-14 system is a prime example of the importance of high-resolution imaging: <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Buchhave et al. (2011)</ref> report that the planetary radius and mass would have been underestimated by 10% and 60%, respectively, without high-resolution follow-up images. Their analysis of ground-based follow-up images revealed that the target star is in a close binary system with a nearby star only 0.5 magnitudes fainter and 0. ′′ 3 away. The Kepler team and community have used speckle imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howell et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Horch et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kane et al. 2014</ref>), lucky imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lillo-Box et al. 2012</ref>), high-resolution adaptive optics imaging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. , 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. 2013</ref>), and Hubble Space Telescope snapshots (SNAP Program 12893; PI: R. Gilliland) to accomplish this objective.</p><p>In this paper, we present adaptive optics images of 87 Kepler planet candidates acquired in September 2012, October 2012, and September 2013 in order to investigate whether any of the target stars are diluted due to nearby stars and to place limits on the presence of additional stars in the Kepler target aperture. We explain our observing strategy in Section 2, the target sample in Section 3, and our data reduction process in Section 4. We then discuss the detected visual companions in Section 5 and place limits on undetected stars in Section 6. We compare our findings to the results of previous surveys in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>All observations were taken using the Arizona Infrared Imager and Echelle Spectrograph (ARIES) behind the adaptive optics system on the 6.5m Multiple-Mirror Telescope (MMT). We used the target star as a natural guide star and ran the AO system at speeds between 10 and 550 Hz depending on the brightness of the target star and the current observing conditions. The resulting fullwidth at half-maximum of the target star point spread functions (PSFs) varied between 0. ′′ 1 and 0. ′′ 58, with a median value of 0. ′′ 25. The airmass of our targets ranged from 1.01 to 2.01, with a median value of 1.16.</p><p>We observed all targets using a four-point dither pattern in f /30 mode with a plate scale of 0 ′′ .02085 pixel −1 and a field of view of 20 ′′ ×20 ′′ . We also observed KOI 886 in f /15 mode with a plate scale of 0 ′′ .04 pixel −1 and a field of view of 40 ′′ × 40 ′′ , but we opted to use the images taken in f /30 mode for the final reduction. The field rotator was turned on for the observations acquired in 2012 but not for the observations taken in 2013. Accordingly, more distant stars are smeared by field rotation in the images acquired in 2013.</p><p>Under ideal conditions, ARIES is diffraction-limited in J, H, Ks in f /30 mode down to a limiting magnitude of Ks = 21, and diffraction-limited in Ks in f /15 mode down to a limiting magnitude of Ks = 22. The measured Strehl ratios were 0.3 in Ks and 0.05 in J for ARIES observations acquired in May 2010 under favorable observing conditions with uncorrected seeing of 0. ′′ 5 in Ks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>We varied the integration times for individual exposures between 0.8 seconds and 89.9 seconds depending on the stellar magnitude. Our observing strategy was intentionally more sensitive to fainter companions around fainter target stars because the amount of transit depth dilution is governed by the brightness ratio of the target star and the contaminating star. For our shortest exposure times of 0.8 seconds, we were sensitive to companions as faint as Ks = 15.4 − 17.2 depending on the observing conditions.</p><p>We typically repeated the four-point dither pattern four times for a total of 16 images in Ks band per star. For most targets, the dither pattern had a throw of 2 ′′ , but we increased the throw to 3 ′′ when we noticed nearby stars in the acquisition image. In nine cases, we also imaged objects with close companions in J band in order to determine the color of the companion and better estimate the relative contribution of each star to the flux measured by Kepler. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> provides a list of target stars with detected companions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">TARGET SAMPLE</head><p>We conducted our observations as part of the Kepler team follow-up effort. We selected our targets from the lists of Kepler planet candidates available at the time of our observing runs in <ref type="bibr">Fall 2012 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Fall 2013</ref>. Some of the planet candidates associated with our target stars were later reclassified as false positives and additional planet candidates were detected in several systems. When selecting our sample, we prioritized relatively bright (Kp 14) stars with small planet candidates. The Ks magnitude of our selected sample extends from Ks = 8.6 to Ks = 12.7 with a median magnitude of Ks = 11.6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>We reduced the ARIES observations of each star using the IRAF and python pipeline described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. ( , 2013a</ref>. We calibrated each set of dithered images using standard IRAF procedures 6 and then used the xmosaic function in the xdimsum package to combine and sky-subtract the images. For targets with detected companions, we determined the approximate orientation of the field from the dither pattern. Our field orientations are therefore approximate and should be treated as general guidelines with an accuracy of a few degrees.</p><p>We searched for visual companions to our target stars by looking for bright objects in the reduced images using the IRAF routine daophot and by visually inspecting each image. The automated IRAF routines sometimes triggered on residual PSF speckles and image artifacts near the edges of the CCD and in a square pattern one-half CCD width away from bright stars, but those artifacts were easier to identify visually. Due to the quasi-static nature of speckles, we saw similarities in the speckle pattern throughout the course of the night. We could therefore distinguish between speckles and visual companions by whether the objects reappeared in images of multiple target stars or whether they were unique to a particular target star.</p><p>For the companions that passed visual inspection, we measured the magnitude difference relative to the target star using the IRAF routine phot. We adopted a 5 pixel aperture in order to sample most of the PSF of the target star without contaminating the measurement with light from nearby stars. We tested the effect of using larger apertures for stars observed in poor seeing conditions and found only slight changes (0.001 -0.03 magnitudes) in the differential photometry.</p><p>For the closest companions (stars within 0. ′′ 5 of the target star), we instead determined the relative magnitude by simultaneously fitting the PSFs using the same Mathematica routines as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. ( , 2013a</ref>. Our PSF fitting routine fits a Bessel-Lorentzian-Fourier model to each star using six Bessel and four Fourier terms.</p><p>We followed the procedure outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. ( , 2013a</ref> to determine the approximate Kepler magnitude, Kp, of identified companions. We first measured the brightness differential between the target stars and companions in Ks (and J when available) and converted those to apparent magnitudes for the companions using the target star Ks and J magnitudes reported in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) as absolute references. For systems with detected companions within 2 ′′ we assumed that the stars would have been blended in 2MASS. In those cases, we recomputed the magnitudes of each component so that the total system magnitudes were equal to the catalog values. We then estimated the Kp magnitude of companion stars using the relations provided in Appendix A of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Howell et al. (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">VISUAL COMPANIONS</head><p>Out of 87 targets, we detected close visual companions for 27 stars: five stars have detected companions within 1 ′′ , seven have detected companions within 2 ′′ , and 15 have detected companions within 4 ′′ . We present ARIES images of the stars with companions within 1 ′′ in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, companions within 1 − 2 ′′ in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, and companions within 2 − 4 ′′ in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The ARIES field of view extends to 20 ′′ × 20 ′′ , but objects within 4 ′′ , the size of a Kepler pixel, are most likely to dilute planetary transits without revealing their presence by inducing a significant centroid shift.</p><p>For stars with detected companions, the properties of the associated planet candidates will need to be reevaluated to account for the contaminating light in the aperture. We provide rough dilution corrections to the reported planet radii for stars with companions at separations &lt; 2 ′′ . This dilution correction will increase the radii of associated planets by a given percentage. Stars at larger separations also contribute to the background flux due to the large size of Kepler 's target apertures, but the fraction of companion star flux collected depends on the Kepler pixel response function, which varies across the focal plane ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bryson et al. 2010)</ref>, and the specific aperture selected for the target each quarter as the spacecraft is rotated.</p><p>A thorough analysis of the quarter-by-quarter dilution correction for each KOI is beyond the scope of this paper, so we restrict our dilution corrections to a simple order-of-magnitude estimate for the closest companions. In our simple model, we assume that the transit source orbits the target star and that all of the light from both the target and the close companion is captured in the target aperture. In some cases, the transit source might actually be the fainter star detected via adaptive optics imaging rather than the target star. If the planet candidate actually orbits the fainter star, then the planet properties must be completely reevaluated based on the properties of the fainter star. This can result in significant changes to the assumed planet radius, particularly if the fainter star is a background star and not physically associated with the target star. We discuss individual target stars with identified companions in the following sections and list all detected stars within 10 ′′ in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. We caution that this list may be incomplete at larger angular separations because some stars may have been off the edge of the ARIES detector. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">KOI 266</head><p>This system contains a 1.6 R ⊕ planet candidate with a 25.3 day period and a second 1.8 R ⊕ planet candidate with a 47.7 day period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burke et al. 2014</ref>). Our ARIES observations revealed a star roughly 6.3 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 266 at a distance of 3. ′′ 62. KOI 266 was previously inspected 7 using speckle imagery with DSSI on WIYN, but the nearby star was beyond the 3. ′′ 2 × 3. ′′ 2 speckle field of view. This star was previously imaged by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. ( , 2013b</ref>, who reported that the companion is 6.6 J magnitudes fainter and 6.1 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 266, resulting in an estimated Kepler magnitude of Kp = 19.3. For the rest of this paper, we adopt the magnitude estimates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. ( , 2013b</ref>) because the visual companion is slightly smeared in our image due to field rotation. The nearby star is also listed in UKIRT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lawrence et al. 2007</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rowe et al. 2014</ref>). We detected another star 3. ′′ 86 from the target star. The nearby star is 5.13 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 720 and is predicted to have Kp = 19.9 (∆Kp = 6.2). KOI 720 has been observed with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on WIYN and at low quality with Robo-AO on the Palomar 1.5-m ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. 2013</ref>). The companion we detected is visible in UKIRT and has a reported J magnitude of 17.67. The maximum dilution correction for a star 5.13 Ks magnitudes fainter than the target star is a 0.2% correction to the planet radii, so the dilution correction is unlikely to be significant given the nearly 4 ′′ separation between KOI 720 and the companion and the large brightness contrast between the stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">KOI 1279</head><p>This system contains two short-period planet candidates with radii of 1.6 R ⊕ and 0.9 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>We detected a star 3.74 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 1279 at a distance of 2. ′′ 62. The star is predicted to have Kp = 18.6 (∆Kp = 4.8). KOI 1279 has also been observed using speckle imaging with DSSI on WIYN and at low quality with Robo-AO on the Palomar 1.5-m ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. 2013</ref>). The companion we detected was visible in the UKIRT image of the field and has a reported J magnitude of J = 16.54. KOI 1279 does not exhibit a large source offset during transits, which supports the interpretation that the planet candidates orbit the target star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">KOI 1677</head><p>KOI 1677 hosts a 2.2 R ⊕ planet candidate with a 52.1 day orbit and a 0.8 R ⊕ candidate with a 8.5 day orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). We detected a companion 2.48 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 1677 at a distance of 0. ′′ 6. Using the relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Howell et al. (2012)</ref>, the predicted Kp magnitude for the companion is Kp = 17.6 (∆Kp = 3.3). This object was also detected in a medium-quality Robo-AO image of KOI 1677 and has an estimated magnitude of i = 18.83 ± 0.44 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. 2013</ref>). Assuming that all of the flux from the target star and the companion is captured in the Kepler aperture and that the planet orbits the target star, the planet radius estimate should be increased by roughly 2% to account for the contamination from the nearby star. KOI 1677 does not display a significant offset during the transits of KOI 1677.01, but the centroid analysis for KOI 1677.02 is not yet available. This system contains two planet candidates with periods of 4.6 and 6.7 days and radii of 1.6 and 1.0 R ⊕ , respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). We detected a companion 4.45 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 2158 at a distance of 2. ′′ 27. The companion is predicted to have Kp = 18.2 (∆Kp = 5.2). KOI 2158 has also been observed with DSSI on WIYN and at medium quality with Robo-AO on the Palomar 1.5-m. The companion was detected in UKIRT and has a reported J magnitude of 17.15. KOI 2158 does not exhibit a large source offset during the transits of either planet candidate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">KOI 2159</head><p>KOI 2159 hosts one candidate planet with a period of 7.6 days and a radius of 1.1 R ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). The NASA Exoplanet Archive entry for KOI 2159 also includes a 1 R ⊕ false positive at a period of 2.4 days. Our ARIES observations revealed a companion 2.52 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 2159 at a distance of 1. ′′ 95. The estimated Kp magnitude for the companion is 16.7 (∆Kp = 3.2). This companion was also listed as a likely detection with Robo-AO in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. (2013)</ref> based on a medium-quality image and has an estimated magnitude of i = 17.28 ± 0.53. The star was also detected in UKIRT and has a J band magnitude of 15.57. The estimated dilution correction due to the extra light from the companion is a 3% increase to the planet radius. KOI 2159 does not display a significant source offset during transit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">KOI 2298</head><p>This system contains a 1 R ⊕ planet candidate with a 16.7 day orbit ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>). NEXSci also reports a 0.8 R ⊕ false positive with a 31.8 day period. We detected a companion 1.3 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 2298 at a distance of 1. ′′ 47. The companion is expected to have Kp = 15.2 (∆Kp = 1.4), indicating that the contamination from this companion star may lead to a significant underestimate of the planet radius. In the simple approximation that all light from the companion star is captured in the Kepler aperture, the radius estimated for the planet should be increased by 13% to account for the dilution if indeed the planet orbits the target star and the companion has Kp = 14.9. However, the companion may be the same object identified roughly  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batalha et al. 2013</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS</head><p>As discussed in Section 5, we detected visual companions within 2 ′′ around 11 of the 81 targets that host planet candidates or confirmed planets. The overall companion rate of 13% for planet (candidate) host stars is slightly lower than the rates of 20% and 17% found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al.

(2013)</ref> using Robo-AO on the robotic Palomar 60-inch telescope. Within 3 ′′ we found companions for 14 (17%) of the 81 targets hosting planet candidates or confirmed planets. This rate agrees well with the rate of 17% found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lillo-Box et al. (2012)</ref> using lucky imaging.</p><p>Due to the efficiency of Robo-AO observations, the Robo-AO sample of 715 KOIs is much larger than the samples of 90, 12, 98, and 87 KOIs observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al.

The Robo-AO team was therefore able to divide their sample into different categories and search for variations in the stellar multiplicity rate as a function of stellar or planetary properties. They found a slight (1.6σ) discrepancy between the stellar multiplicity of single KOI systems and multiple KOI systems, but the difference was not statistically significant. We also found a higher companion fraction for the 56 single KOI systems (18%) compared to the 26 multiple KOI systems (4%), which lends additional support to the theory that single KOI systems are more likely to be false positives than multiple KOI systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lissauer et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lissauer et al. , 2014</ref>. Comparing the companion rates from different studies is not straightforward due to the small sample sizes of most of the studies and the differences in target sample selection, observing strategy, sensitivity, and weather conditions. The targets discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. (2013)</ref> were selected randomly with the express goal of reproducing the general features of the full planet candidate population. In contrast, our observations and those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al. ( , 2013b</ref> were prioritized to target small planet candidates around bright or moderately faint <ref type="bibr">(Kp 14)</ref> stars. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>, the stars in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012)</ref> sample are typically brighter than the stars observed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Law et al. (2013)</ref> and the stars discussed in this paper. The median Kp magnitude of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012)</ref> sample is Kp = 12.2 whereas the median magnitude of our sample is Kp = 13.3. The  <ref type="formula">)</ref> observed their targets at visible wavelengths using an SDSS-i' filter and a longpass filter (LP600) that selects wavelengths redder than 600 nm and cuts off near 1000 nm. The shape of the LP600 filter matches the red end of the Kepler bandpass, so the contrast ratios measured in LP600 are more similar to the contrast ratios that the stars would have in the Kepler bandpass than the contrast ratios measured at near-infrared wavelengths.</p><p>In contrast, near-infrared observations are more sensitive to faint, red companions that may be below the detection limit at visible wavelengths. For example, the faint (∆Ks = 2.5, estimated ∆Kp = 3.1) companion to KOI 2159 that we discuss in Section 5.6 was classified as a "likely" Robo-AO detection rather than a "secure" detection because the detection significance was below their formal 5σ limit. Depending on weather conditions and the magnitude of the host star, observations with ARIES or PHARO may also have smaller inner working angles than Robo-AO observations. For instance, the close-in (0. ′′ 13) companion to KOI 1537 reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2012)</ref> was too close to the target star to be resolved with Robo-AO.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>, we find that the stars with visual companions are slightly more likely to be located at lower galactic latitudes than stars without identified companions. This indicates that some of the visual companions identified within 4 ′′ are likely to be background objects because the background density of stars is higher near the galactic plane. Concentrating on the stars with companions identified within 2 ′′ , we see that the bias towards lower galactic latitudes is slightly reduced, as would be expected if many of the companions identified within 4 ′′ are not physically bound to the target star. Interestingly, none of our target stars have two detected companions within 4 ′′ whereas Adams et al. (2012) detected multiple stars within 4 ′′ near eight of their 90 targets and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lillo-Box et al. (2012)</ref> found that 3% of their targets had at least two companions within 3 ′′ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our sample of target stars hosts 34 confirmed planets, 92 planet candidates, and 9 false positive KOIs. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we display the radii and periods of these KOIs and denote which objects orbit stars with detected visual companions. Four of the stars with visual companions within 1 ′′ and all of the stars with companions within 2 ′′ host planet candidates smaller than 1.5 R ⊕ . In most cases, the estimated dilution corrections for these systems are small enough that the planet radii would change by only a few percent after accounting for the extra light in the aperture. In the extreme cases of KOI 2421 and KOI 2790, however, the approximate dilution corrections of 23% and 17%, respectively, would increase the radii of the associated planet candidates by over 0.15 R ⊕ . The change in the planet properties might be even larger if the planet candidates orbit the visual companions instead of the target stars.</p><p>In addition to planet (candidate) host stars, our sample also includes 9 stars that were previously identified as planet host stars but have been revealed to be false positives. Our ARIES observations revealed visual companions within 4 ′′ of five of those stars (K02159, K02298, K02771, K02838, and K02879). Although this paper focuses on the search for companions to planet host stars, knowledge about the contamination of the light curves of stars without detected planets is equally important for computing planet occurrence rates. Most calculations of the frequency of planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Catanzarite &amp; Shao 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Youdin 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mann et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Traub 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gaidos 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kopparapu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Petigura et al. 2013a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Swift et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">but see Fressin et al. 2013</ref>) neglect flux contamination from nearby stars when estimating the smallest planet that could have been seen around a particular star, but additional light from a companion star could dilute the transit signals of small planets and render them undetectable. Failing to account for this dilution could therefore lead to an overestimate of the search completeness and an underestimate of the planet occurrence rate. In addition, stars with nearby visual companions of different spectral types might be misclassified due to their unusual colors, further complicating estimates of the search completeness.</p><p>For stars with companions closer than 2. ′′ 0, we estimated the appropriate dilution corrections for the radii of associated planet candidates. Depending on the magnitude differences and angular separations between the target stars and the identified companions, the approximate corrections to the planet radii varied from 0.2% to 23%. Given that radial velocity observations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Weiss et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014)</ref> and planet formation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013)</ref> have revealed that the transition between rocky and gaseous planets occurs at roughly 1.5 R ⊕ , this change has important implications for frequency of rocky planets in the galaxy. If the radii of many Kepler planet candidates are indeed underestimated, then the true frequency of rocky planets may be lower than previously estimated. However, we must caution that dilution from background stars will also make the detection of truly tiny planets more challenging. Accordingly, the Kepler census of rocky planets may be less complete than previously estimated.</p><p>In the next few years, observations of Kepler target stars with <ref type="bibr">Gaia (Perryman et al. 2001</ref>) will help disentangle blended systems by providing distance estimates for the host stars. In the case of blended systems in which the stars have nearly equal brightnesses, the distance reported by Gaia will be roughly 1.4 times that estimated from photometry alone. In that case, we will be able to infer that the system is a blend and that the radii of any planet candidates within the system are underestimated. Until we receive the Gaia data, however, we can inspect systems individually using ground-based observations like those presented in this paper and serendipitous space-based observations from the HST SNAP program (SNAP Program 12893; PI: R.

We detected a companion 6.69 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 2971 at a distance of 3. ′′ 48. The predicted Kp magnitude of the companion is Kp = 21.4 (∆Kp = 8.7). KOI 2971 has also been observed using speckle imaging with DSSI on WIYN. The detected companion was identified in UKIRT and has a reported J magnitude of 20.76. The detection limit near 3. ′′ 5 in our J band ARIES image is J = 15.3, so we are not able to estimate the J band magnitude of the companion from our data. <ref type="bibr">KOI</ref>  </p></div>

We detected a companion 5.25 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 3111 at a distance of 3. ′′ 33. The predicted Kp magnitude of the companion is Kp = 19.4 (∆Kp = 6.5). KOI 3111 has also been observed with speckle imaging using DSSI at WIYN. The companion we identified was visible in UKIRT and has a J band magnitude of 17.98. KOI 3111 exhibits a 2. ′′ 847 (3.09σ) source offset during the transits of KOI 3111.01, but only a 1. ′′ 89 (1.64σ) source offset during the transits of KOI 3111.02.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.27.">KOI 3117</head><p>KOI 3117 hosts a 1.5 R ⊕ planet candidate with a 6.1 day period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Burke et al. 2014</ref>). We detected a companion 6.1 Ks magnitudes fainter than KOI 3117 at a separation of 2. ′′ 61. The estimated Kp magnitude of the companion is Kp = 20.7 (∆Kp = 7.5). KOI 3117 has also been observed with speckle imaging using DSSI at WIYN, but the source was not detected in the 3. ′′ 2 by 3. ′′ 2 field of view. The reported 3σ speckle detection limits for an annulus extending from 1. ′′ 7 -1. ′′ 9 (the farthest reported separation) are 4.095 magnitudes at 692nm and 3.381 magnitudes at 880nm. The lack of a speckle detection is not surprising given the large Ks magnitude contrast between the target and the companion and the likelihood that the companion would be even fainter in the bluer 692nm and 880nm filters used in the speckle imaging. KOI 3117 does not display a significant source offset during transit.</p></div>

The widths of the non-overlapping annuli were 0. ′′ 05 for separations within 0. ′′ 2, 0. ′′ 1 between 0. ′′ 2 and 1. ′′ 0, and 1 ′′ at separations beyond 1 ′′ .
