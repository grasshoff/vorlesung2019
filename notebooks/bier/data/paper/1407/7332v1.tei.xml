			<abstract>
				<p>We develop a detailed methodology of determining three-dimensionally the angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axis vectors, ψ, for transiting planetary systems. The determination of ψ requires the independent estimates of the inclination angles of the stellar spin axis and of the planetary orbital axis with respect to the line-of-sight, i ⋆ and i orb , and the projection of the spin-orbit angle onto the plane of the sky, λ. These are mainly derived from asteroseismology, transit lightcurve and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, respectively. The detailed joint analysis of those three datasets enables an accurate and precise determination of the numerous parameters characterizing the planetary system, in addition to ψ. We demonstrate the power of the joint analysis for the two specific systems, HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25. HAT-P-7b is the first exoplanet suspected to be a retrograde (or polar) planet because of the significant misalignment λ ≈ 180 •. Our joint analysis indicates i ⋆ ≈ 30 • and ψ ≈ 120 • , suggesting that the planetary orbit is closer to polar rather than retrograde. Kepler-25 is one of the few multi-transiting planetary systems with measured λ, and hosts two short-period transiting planets and one outer non-transiting planet. The projected spin-orbit angle of the larger transiting planet, Kepler-25c, has been measured to be λ ≈ 0 • , implying that the system is well-aligned. With the help of the tight constraint from asteroseismology, however, we obtain i ⋆ = 65. • 4 +10. • 6 −6. • 4 and ψ = 26. • 9 +7. • 0 −9. • 2 , and thus find that the system is actually mildly misaligned. This is the first detection of the spin-orbit misalignment for the multiple planetary system with a main-sequence host star, and points to mechanisms that tilt a stellar spin axis relative to its protoplanetary disk.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The spin-orbit angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital axes, ψ, is supposed to be a unique observational probe of the origin and evolution of planetary systems. The existence of Jupiter-like planets with orbital periods less than a week strongly indicates that the inward migration of those planets is a basic ingredient of successful theories of planet formation and evolution. A fairly popular scenario of the migration is based on the planet-disk interaction, in which planets are supposed to be on circular orbits whose orbital axes are parallel to the stellar spin axis. On the other hand, scenarios such as planet-planet scattering or the Kozai mechanism predict a broad range of eccentric and oblique orbits. Thus the precise determination of ψ and its statistical distribution put a tight constraint on the viable migration models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Queloz et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>While the measurement of ψ is not easy, its projection onto the plane of the sky, λ, has already been measured for more than 70 transiting planetary systems via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Winn, 2011)</ref>, and is now established as one of the most basic parameters that characterize transiting planetary systems.</p><p>The RM effect was originally proposed to determine the projected spin-orbit angle of eclipsing binary star systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Rossiter, 1924;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McLaughlin, 1924)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Queloz et al. (2000)</ref> successfully applied the technique for the first discovered transiting exoplanetary system, HD 209458, and obtained λ = ±3. • 9 +18 • −21 • . In the quest for improving the precision and accuracy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref> presented an analytic formula to describe the RM effect and studied in detail the error budget and possible degeneracy among different parameters. This allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al. (2005)</ref> to revisit HD 209458 with updated photometric and spectroscopic data, and to obtain λ = −4. • 4 ± 1. • 4, improving the precision of the previous measurement by an order of magnitude.</p><p>In doing so, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al. (2005)</ref> pointed out that the analytic approximation adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref> leads to typically 10 percent error in the predicted veloc-[Vol. , ity anomaly amplitude, while the estimated λ is fairly reliable. This motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hirano et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hirano et al. (2011)</ref> to take into account stellar rotation, macroturbulence, and thermal/pressure/instrumental broadenings in modeling the stellar absorption line profiles. Those authors derived an analytic formula for the velocity anomaly of the RM effect by maximizing the cross-correlation function between the in-transit spectrum and the stellar template spectrum. As a result, their analytic formulae reproduce mock simulations within ∼ 0.5 percent, enabling the accurate and efficient multi-dimensional fit of parameters characterizing the star and planet(s) of an individual system.</p><p>More importantly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Winn et al. (2005)</ref> clearly demonstrated the potential of the RM effect to put strong quantitative constraints on the existing and/or future planetary formation scenarios. Indeed, when HD 209458 was the only known transiting planetary system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ohta et al. (2005)</ref> discussed that "Although unlikely, we may even speculate that a future RM observation may discover an extrasolar planetary system in which the stellar spin and the planetary orbital axes are anti-parallel or orthogonal. Then it would have a great impact on the planetary formation scenario, . . . ". In reality, however, they were too conservative. Among the 70 transiting planetary systems observed with the RM effect, more than 30 systems exhibit significant misalignment with |λ| &gt; 22.</p><p>• 5 [ see, e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure 7</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Xue et al. (2014)</ref> ]. This unexpected diversity of the spin-orbit angle is not yet properly understood by the existing theories, and remains an interesting challenge (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Nagasawa et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Nagasawa &amp; Ida, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2012a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lai, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Albrecht et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Masuda et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Xue et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>It should be noted, however, that λ differs from the true spin-orbit angle ψ due to the projection on the sky. In addition to λ, ψ also depends on the orbital inclination i orb and the obliquity of the stellar spin-axis i ⋆ : cosψ = cosi ⋆ cosi orb + sini ⋆ sin i orb cosλ,</p><p>as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The main purpose of this paper is to establish a methodology to determine ψ, instead of λ, through the joint analysis of asteroseismology, transit lightcurve, and the RM effect, and to present specific results for a couple of interesting transiting planetary systems, HAT-P-7 1 (KIC 10666592) and <ref type="bibr">Kepler-25 (KIC 4349452)</ref>.</p><p>In the case of transiting planetary systems, i orb can be estimated from the transit lightcurve, and in any case is close to 90 • . Given the projected angle λ measured from the RM effect, the major uncertainty for ψ comes from the unknown stellar inclination i ⋆ .</p><p>There are two major and complementary approaches to estimate i ⋆ , and hence ψ. One is to determine the line-of-sight rotational velocity of the star, v sin i ⋆ , either We choose a coordinate system centered on the star, where the XY -plane is in the plane of the sky and +Z-axis points towards the observer. The +Y -axis is chosen along the sky-projected stellar spin and the X-axis is perpendicular to both Y -and Z-axes, forming a right-handed triad.</p><p>Red and green arrows indicate on a unit sphere, the angular momentum vectors of the stellar spin and the planetary orbital motion, respectively. The stellar and orbital inclinations, i⋆ and i orb , are measured from the +Z-axis and in the range of <ref type="bibr">[0 • ,180 • ]</ref>. The planetary orbital axis projected onto the sky plane is specified by the projected spin-orbit angle, λ, which is measured from the +Y -axis and in the range of <ref type="bibr">[0 • , 360 • ]</ref>. Note that λ is measured in the direction specified by the arrow. The angle AOC between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axis vectors, ψ, is derived from the law of cosines for the spherical triangles ABC, as given by Equation (1).</p><p>from the width of absorption lines or from the RM effect. The observed v sin i ⋆ is then compared with an independent estimate of the equatorial velocity of the star, v, to yield i ⋆ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Schlaufman (2010)</ref> used an empirical relation for Sun-like stars to evaluate v from their masses and ages. Alternatively, one can determine the stellar spin period photometrically from periodic variations in the lightcurve due to the stellar activity, and then estimate v assuming the stellar radius (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hirano et al., 2012a</ref>). The other is asteroseismology ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Unno et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aerts et al., 2010</ref>) for which the key principles are described in detail later, but briefly summarised below. Thanks to space-borne instruments such as MOST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Walker et al., 2003</ref>), CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr">Baglin et al., 2006a,b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Borucki et al., 2010)</ref>, asteroseismology now opens a good opportunity to unveil the internal structure of many stars with high precision. This is made possible through the detection of oscillation modes propagating throughout the stars with unprecedented precision, because of extraordinary low noise level and uninterrupted extremely long-term data monitoring with short sampling cadences, both of which are never available from the ground-based observations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Appourchaux et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Metcalfe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gizon et al., 2013)</ref>. More details about the recent development in asteroseismology may be found in recent conference proceedings such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Shibahashi et al. (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Shibahashi &amp; Lynas-Gray (2013), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Guzik et al. (2014)</ref>. When coupled with non-seismic observables, the asteroseismic observational information promises accurate inference of fundamental properties of host stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bazot et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Carter et al., 2012</ref>).</p><p>The stellar rotation affects the frequency spectrum of stellar oscillation modes. It induces a multiplet fine structure, whose frequency separation is dependent on the internal rotation profile of the star as well as the stellar structure, for each mode. More importantly, the apparent profiles of the rotationally induced frequency multiplets are very sensitive to the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the line-of-sight, i ⋆ . In turn, one can infer i ⋆ quite well from asteroseismology.</p><p>One might wonder how commonly stellar oscillations that enable asteroseismology can be detected among the host stars of exoplanet systems. Remember that transiting planet hunting preferentially select stars with small radii (i.e. low-mass stars in the main sequence) in order to increase the relative transit depth in the photometric lightcurve. Moreover, such low-mass stars are suitable for the radial velocity follow-up not only because they are more affected by orbital motion of planets but also because they have sharp and narrow absorption lines due to their slow spin rotation velocity. Such low-mass, cool stars have a thick convective envelope (as in the case of the Sun) that sustains pulsations. Turbulent motion with speeds close to that of sound near the stellar surface stochastically generates acoustic waves, which propagate inside the star until they are damped. The oscillations with frequencies close to those of eigenmodes of the star are eventually sustained as many acoustic modes. Therefore cool (i.e. &lt; ≈ 7000 K) host stars for exoplanets should commonly exhibit solarlike oscillations, and thus consitute good targets for asteroseismology.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on two specific exoplanetary systems, HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25; HAT-P-7 is the first example of a system hosting a retrograde or a polarorbit planet, while Kepler-25 is a multi-transiting system with three planets, making them two interesting examples. We show that joint analyses of asteroseismology, transit lightcurve, and the RM effect provide stringent orbital parameter estimates. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarizes the previous RM measurements and radial velocity (RV) data of the two systems. Section 3 presents a detailed description of the basic principle of asteroseismology, followed by our main results of asteroseismology for the two stars in Sections 4 and 5. Sections 6 and 7 analyze the Kepler transit lightcurves and the RV anomaly of the RM effect, using the asteroseismology results as a prior, and show how the joint analysis improves the estimates of the system parameters. Section 8 is devoted to further discussion, and Section 9 summarises the present paper.</p></div>

In addition to the significant spin-orbit misalignment first revealed by the Subaru spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Narita et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Winn et al., 2009)</ref>, the fact that the system is in the Kepler field makes it very attractive as an asteroseismology target.</p><p>Interestingly, there have been three independent measurements of the RM effect for the HAT-P-7 system, which all indicate the significant spin-orbit misalignment, but do not agree quantitatively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Winn et al. (2009)</ref> (hereafter W09) performed the joint analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric transit of HAT-P-7b to obtain λ = 182. • 5 ± 9. • 4. For RVs, they analyzed 17 spectra observed with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HIRES) on the Keck I telescope as well as 69 spectra observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on the Subaru telescope. Eight of the HIRES spectra were from P08 and taken in 2007, while the other nine were obtained in 2009. Among 69 HDS spectra, 40 were obtained on 2009 July 1 that spanned a transit.</p><p>On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Narita et al.

Although they fixed the transit parameters in the analysis of the RM effect, the systematics from the uncertainties of these parameters do not seem to explain the mild discrepancy with the W09 result, according to their discussion (see cases 1 to 4 in section 4 of N09).</p><p>Later on, Albrecht et al. (2012) (hereafter A12) reported another measurement of the RM effect, resulting in λ = 155 • ± 14 • . They analyzed 49 HIRES spectra spanning a transit on the night 2010 July 23/24 with the priors on transit parameters and ephemeris from the Kepler lightcurves.</p><p>In this paper, we use the same RV data published in each of the three papers. Since the origin of the possible discrepancy in λ is not clear, we analyze each data set separately instead of combining the three.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Setting Up the Problem</head><p>Due to its sensitivity to the stellar internal structure, asteroseismology can achieve high-precision determinations of stellar fundamental parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lebreton &amp; Montalbán, 2009</ref>) (e.g., uncertainties of a few percent level for their mass and radius). The stellar modelling using seismic observables mostly relies on the stellar pulsation frequencies, usually extracted from the analysis of the power spectrum of the stellar lightcurve.</p><p>For a spherically symmetric star, each eigenmode is characterised by three quantum numbers; the angular degree l, the azimuthal order m (−l ≤ m ≤ +l), and the radial order n. The degree l corresponds to the number of nodal surface lines, while the azimuthal order m specifies the surface pattern of the eigenfunction, with |m| being the number of longitude lines among the l nodal surface lines. The radial order n corresponds to the number of nodal surfaces along the radius. For a non-rotating star, both the radial eigenfunction and the frequency of each mode are independent of m and show the (2l + 1)-fold degeneracy. The eigenfrequency ν depends on l and n alone. Frequencies of high order, acoustic (or p-) modes of the same low degree (n ≫ l ∼ 1) are almost equally spaced and separated on average by a frequency spacing ∆ν:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ν(n, l) = ∆ν n + l 2 + α + ε n,l ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where α is a constant of order unity, and ε n,l is a small correction. The spacing is related to the sound velocity inside the star by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∆ν = 2 R⋆ 0 1 c(r) dr −1<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and is sensitive to the mean stellar density ρ ⋆ . Therefore, knowing the solar density ρ ⊙ = (1.4060 ± 0.0005) × 10 3 kg m −3 and its frequency spacing ∆ν ⊙ = 135.20 ± 0.25 µHz 2 , one can estimate the mean stellar density from the scaling:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ρ ⋆,s = ρ ⊙ (∆ν/∆ν ⊙ ) 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The stellar rotation lifts the degeneracy among nonradial modes (l = 0), revealing a fine structure of modes identified by their azimuthal order m. In the case of solarlike oscillations, acoustic modes are excited stochastically by turbulent convection. This mechanism is expected to generate almost the same amplitudes in the rotationally split modes with the same l and n. If this is the case, in disk-integrated photometry as achieved by Kepler, the 2 From frequencies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">García et al.

In turn, it enables us to measure ψ of exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chaplin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Van Eylen et al., 2014)</ref>, and indeed revealed a significant spin-orbit misalignment for a red-giant host star system, Kepler-56 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Huber et al., 2013b</ref>). This dependence of visibility in the power spectrum is expressed in terms of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E(l, m, i ⋆ ) = (l − |m|)! (l + |m|)! P |m| l (cosi ⋆ ) 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P |m| l is the associated Legendre function and the integral of E(l,m,i ⋆ ) over cosi ⋆ is normalised by (2l+1) −1 .</p><p>Solar-like oscillators such as Kepler-25 and HAT-P-7 are typically slow rotators for which the centrifugal force can be neglected. In addition, there is no evidence of a strong magnetic field and we can safely neglect it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Reese et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ballot, 2010)</ref>.

Here, H(n, l) is the intrinsic height for the mode of n and l.

Its major purpose was to find extra-solar planets by detecting a small amount drop of the visual brightness of their parent stars, caused by the transits of the planets in front of the stars. So the photometric asteroseismology and planet studies are synergistic. Four times per orbit the satellite was scheduled to perform a roll to keep its solar panels facing the Sun, so the data were divided into 'Quarters' (1/4 of its 372.5-d heliocentric orbit), denoted as Qn.</p><p>For HAT-P-7, we use Q0 to Q16 (1437 days in total) of Kepler data taken every 1-min ('Short Cadence' data; SC), while for Kepler-25, we used Q5 to Q16 (1114 days) SC data.

It is known that semiconvective zones are present in stars of ∼ 1.5 M ⊙ . Since a small convective core in such stars expands due to the growing importance of the CNO cycle, the opacity is larger at the outer side of the convective boundary than at its inner side. We adopt the M. Schwarzschild treatment to define the boundary between the convective and radiative zones in such a case. With expected mass larger than 1.2 M ⊙ , HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25 may have a convective core.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Mode Degree Identification</head><p>Prior to modelling a star, it is important to identify the degree l from the power spectrum. In solar-like cool stars (K, G type) the identification is often obvious and relies on thé echelle diagram ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grec et al., 1983)</ref>. AnéchelleAnéchelle diagram is built by dividing the power spectrum into frequency bins of interval ∆, that are stacked in order to form an image in which the power is color-coded. In this image, the Y-axis represents the central frequency of each bin, while the X-axis corresponds to the frequency modulo ∆. Note that the central frequency of the bins is a discrete quantity and one could use instead an integer for the Y-axis. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figures 5 and 6</ref> are the correspondingéchelle correspondingéchelle diagram for HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25 stacked with ∆ = 59.9µHz and ∆ = 97.8µHz, respectively. If we choose ∆ = ∆ν, the excess power due to the modes of the same degree l should show up along an almost straight vertical line <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . This is because p-modes of the same degree are almost regularly spaced in frequency, as implied by Equation (2).</p><p>[Vol. , Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2)</ref> shows that ν(n, l) = ν(n − 1, l + 2) as long as ε n,l is small. Thus the eigenmodes of (n, l = 0) and (n − 1, l = 2) have approximately the same frequencies. The same is true for (n, l = 1) and (n − 1, l = 3). On the other hand, the pulsation amplitude of the surface, and consequently the integrated luminosity variation, are smaller for larger l modes. Thus, the detected photometric amplitudes of the pulsation are usually dominated by l = 0 and l = 1, and l ≥ 3 are often buried in the noise. This is why the careful visual inspection of the relative height and frequency of the power spectra enable us to identify the corresponding modes. This approach works for Kepler-25, but not for HAT-P-7 in reality. The power spectrum of HAT-P-7 exhibits significant mixture of l = 0 and l = 2 modes, and it is hard to disentangle them by visual inspection. In such a case that the modes of the same l are almost regularly spaced in frequency, there exist two possibilities: either (S1) the fit misidentifies the modes, or (S2) the fit correctly identifies the mode. As for the former, all modes of degrees l = 0 and l = 2 would be misidentified as l = 1 modes (and vice-versa). This problem of mode identification is recurrent in F stars and was first encountered in a star observed by CoRoT, HD 49933 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Appourchaux et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>The most likely solution among the two competitive solutions (S1) and (S2) described above may be judged by the Bayes factor between S1 and S2 [see Using our MCMC samples, we evaluated the Bayes factor at 10 6 : 1 in favour of modes with frequencies listed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jeffreys (1961)</ref> , the Bayes factor &gt; 100 is "Decisive", and thus one can safely assume that the mode identification is correct.

To verify this quantitatively, we attempted to detect modes of degree l = 3 by comparing the Bayes factor between a model M l≤3 , that includes those modes, with a model M l≤2 that does not. We obtained a factor ≃ 2 : 1 and ≃ 2.5 : 1 for HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25 respectively, in favour of M l≤2 , which is the simplest model.

Solid lines are the best-fit lightcurves obtained from the simultaneous fit to both lightcurves. We use the transit model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref>, and binned model fluxes are calculated by averaging fluxes sampled at 0.1-minute interval. In this figure, the transit and occultation are shifted in time by t c, tra and P/2 + t c, tra , respectively, where t c, tra is the central time of the phase-folded transit lightcurve. This parameter is introduced to take into account the uncertainty in t 0 , and the best-fit value of t c, tra is indeed within that uncertainty (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).

The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> illustrates this subtle effect by comparing the best-fit transit and occultation lightcurves. Here the depth of the occultation is scaled by δ, the occultation depth divided by (R p /R ⋆ ) 2 , for ease of comparison. In this panel, the egress of the occultation occurs slightly later than that of the transit, while the difference is smaller for their ingresses. In other words, our best-fit model indicates that the occultation duration is longer than the transit one and that the center of occultation deviates from P/2. These are most likely due to the asymmetry of the orbit introduced by the slight but non-zero eccentricity, as well as the time delay of 4.5×10 −4 days due to the finite speed of light (twice the orbital semi-major axis divided by the speed of light; calculated for M ⋆ = 1.59 M ⊙ ). In fact, with the non-zero eccentricity and the above light-travel time included, the simultaneous fit to the phase-folded transit and occultation lightcurves give tight constraints on the planet's eccentricity, ecosω = 0.00026±0.00015 and esinω = 0.0041±0.0022, where ω is the argument of periastron measured from the plane of the sky.

We obtain a/R ⋆ = 4.131 ± 0.009 from the above fit, and then deduce ρ ⋆ = (0.275 ± 0.002) × 10 3 kg m −3 from</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">ρ ⋆ = 3π GP 2 a R ⋆ 3 1 + M p M ⋆ −1 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where G denotes the gravitational constant, and M p /M ⋆ ∼ 10 −3 can be neglected. This value is larger than ρ ⋆,s based on the seismic scaling relation by 2.4σ, but consistent with ρ ⋆,m from the stellar model at the 1σ level (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). For this reason, we adopt the constraints from the stellar model as the prior information in the following joint fit. The choice of the prior, however, does not affect the spinorbit angle determination, but only slightly changes the values of a/R ⋆ , ρ ⋆ , cosi orb , and esinω. The slight discrepancy between ρ ⋆ from the seismic scaling relation (ρ ⋆,s ) and that from transit and occultation implies that the current precision of the Kepler photometry has reached the level that could permit an independent test of the seismic scaling relation for the mean stellar density.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.">Method</head><p>In this subsection, we report the joint MCMC analysis of phase-folded transit and occultation lightcurves (cf. Section 6.1) and RVs (cf. Section 2.1) making use of the prior constraints on the mean stellar density ρ ⋆ , projected stellar rotational velocity v sini ⋆ , and stellar inclination i ⋆ obtained from asteroseismology in Sections 3-5. As discussed in Section 6.1, the precise constraint on ρ ⋆ (equivalent to that on a/R ⋆ ) helps to lift the degeneracy between a/R ⋆ and e sin ω, thus resulting in improved constraints on these two parameters. In addition, v sin i ⋆ is the key parameter for the RM effect along with λ, and so the constraints on v sin i ⋆ help us to better determine λ from the observed RM signal. Finally, i ⋆ is crucial in determining the three-dimensional spin-orbit angle ψ via Equation (1), which is the major goal of this paper.</p><p>In order to properly handle the possible correlation among λ, v sin i ⋆ , and i ⋆ , we adopt the joint probability distribution for v sin i ⋆ and i ⋆ as the prior in our MCMC analysis and directly calculate the posterior distribution for ψ by floating i ⋆ as well. It should be noted here that our observables do not determine the sign of cos i ⋆ or cos i orb , due to the symmetry with respect to the plane of the sky. In order to take into account this inherent degeneracy, we randomly change the sign of the first term in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>  distribution of ρ ⋆ is almost independent of those of v sini ⋆ and i ⋆ , we include the constraint on this parameter as an independent Gaussian with the central value and width of ρ ⋆,m listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>We adopt the same model (including non-zero eccentricity and light-travel time) for transit and occultation as in Section 6.1. The observed RVs are modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">v ⋆,model (t) = v ⋆,orb (t) + v ⋆,RM (t) + γ i + ˙ γ(t − t 0 ).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">v ⋆,orb = K ⋆ [cos(ω + f ) + e cosω]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>is the stellar orbital RVs for the Keplerian orbit, where K ⋆ is the RV semi-amplitude and f is the true anomaly of the planet. The γ i (i = 1,2) are the constant offsets for RVs from Keck/HIRES (i = 1) and Subaru/HDS (i = 2), and ˙ γ accounts for the linear trend in the observed RVs in the W09 data set ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Winn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Narita et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al., 2014</ref>). Finally, anomalous RVs due to the RM effect, v ⋆,RM , are modeled following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hirano et al. (2011)</ref>. The parameters characterizing the RM model include v sin i ⋆ (projected rotational velocity of the star), β (Gaussian dispersion of spectral lines), γ (Lorentzian dispersion of spectral lines), ζ (macroturbulence dispersion of spectral lines), u 1RM + u 2RM , and u 1RM − u 2RM (coefficients for the quadratic limb-darkening law in the RM effect). We do not take into account the effect of convective blueshift <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Shporer &amp; Brown, 2011)</ref>, as its typical amplitude (∼ 1m s −1 ) is smaller than the (jitter-included) precision of the RVs analyzed here.</p><p>We impose the non-seismic priors as well on some of the model parameters. For the ephemeris, we use the Gaussian priors t 0 (BJD) − 2454833 = 121.3585049 ± 0.0000049 and P = 2.204735427 ± 0.000000013 days obtained from the transit lightcurves. The priors on the RM parameters (β, γ, ζ, u 1RM + u 2RM , and u 1RM − u 2RM ) are almost the same as in A12. Namely, we fix β = 3 km s −1 and γ = 1 km s −1 , and assume Gaussian prior ζ = 5.18 ± 1.5 km s −1 . We fix the value of u 1RM − u 2RM at −0.023 from the tables of Claret <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2000)</ref> for the Johnson V band and the ATLAS model. The value is obtained using the jktld tool 8 for the parameters T eff = 6350 K, log g (cgs) = 4.07, and [Fe/H] = 0.3. The value of u 1RM +u 2RM is floated around the tabulated value of 0.70 assuming the Gaussian prior of width 0.10. In addition, we impose an additional Gaussian prior on v sini ⋆ based on the spectroscopic value in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, because the seismic constraint on this parameter is independent of the spectroscopic v sini ⋆ . We assume uniform priors for the other 13 fitting parameters listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> (top and middle blocks).</p><p>In the joint fit, we assume the same values of stellar jitter as used in the original papers; 9.3 m s −1 for the W09 set, 3.8 m s −1 for the Keck/HIRES RVs of the N09 set, and 6.0 m s −1 for the A12 set. In order to prevent the transit and occultation lightcurves from placing unreasonably tight constraints compared to RVs, we also increase the errors quoted for photometric data (evaluated in Section 6.1.2) as σ i = σ 2 i,MAD + σ 2 r . Here, σ r = 5.8 × 10 −6 is a parameter analogous to the RV jitter and chosen so that the reduced χ 2 of the lightcurve fit becomes unity. This prescription is also motivated by the following two facts. First, σ i,MAD tends to underestimate the true uncertainty because it neglects the effect of correlated noise. Indeed, when the number of data points is sufficiently large, uncertainties are dominated by the correlated or "red" noise component <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Pont et al., 2006</ref>). Second, the systematic residuals of the best-fit transit model (top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>) suggest other effects that are not taken into account in our model [e.g., possible planet-induced gravity darkening discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Morris et al. (2013)</ref>]. Placing too much weights on such features could bias the transit parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Results</head><p>Constraints on the system parameters from the joint analysis are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. The "parameters mainly derived from lightcurves/RVs" are the model (fitted) parameters, while the "derived quantities" are the parameters derived from the model parameters (along with M ⋆ and R ⋆ in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for M p , R p , and ρ p ). While our result is in a reasonable agreement with previous studies (c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Morris et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Esteves et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Van Eylen et al., 2013)</ref>, it provides two major improvements.</p><p>First, we determine the orbital eccentricity of HAT-P7b essentially from the photometry (i.e., transit, occultation, and asteroseismology) alone. A similar method has recently been employed by Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Eylen et al. (2014)</ref> to constrain the planet's orbital eccentricity using the seismic stellar density (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dawson &amp; Johnson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kipping, 2014)</ref>, but here we show that this method is also useful for such a low-eccentricity orbit. Furthermore, our result is even more precise and reliable because it takes into account the independent constraint on ρ ⋆ and e from the occultation lightcurve.</p><p>Second, we obtain the probability distribution for the three-dimensional spin-orbit angle ψ in a consistent manner. In the case of HAT-P-7, the constraint on ψ is not very strong because the modest splitting of the azimuthal modes only allows a weak constraint on i ⋆ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure  8</ref>). Nevertheless, we find that the peak values of ψ shift towards 90 • compared to those obtained from the "random" i ⋆ (uniform in cosi ⋆ ) in all three data sets, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. Moreover, the methodology presented here can be applied to other systems, for some of which asteroseismology may be able to tightly constrain i ⋆ unlike HAT-P-7. We will show that this is indeed the case for the Kepler-25 system in the next section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Method</head><p>We repeat almost the same analysis for Kepler-25c as in Section 6. There are, however, several differences in the lightcurve and RV analyses as described below, mainly due to the multiplicity of the Kepler-25 system and relatively small signal-to-noise ratio of the Kepler-25c's transit:</p><p>1. We phase-fold the transits using the actually observed transit times rather than those calculated from the linear ephemeris. This is because the transit times of Kepler-25c (P = 12.7 days) exhibit significant TTVs due to the proximity to the 2 : 1 meanmotion resonance with Kepler-25b (P = 6.2 days). This is why we do not allow t c, tra , the central time of the phase-folded transit, to be a free parameter.</p><p>We adopt σ r = 1.6 × 10 −5 based on the χ 2 of the lightcurve fit. 2. The occultation of Kepler-25c was not detected and not taken into account in the following analysis. 3. As the quality of the transit lightcurve of Kepler25c is not so good as that of HAT-P-7b, we could not determine the limb-darkening coefficients very well. For this reason, we impose the prior u 1 − u 2 = −0.0015 ± 0.50 based on the tables of Claret <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2000)</ref>, and choose u 1 +u 2 and u 1 −u 2 , instead of u 1 and u 2 , as free parameters.

Although the resulting constraints are not very strong due to the modest splittings of azimuthal modes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8</ref>), our results suggest that the orbit of HAT-P-7b is closer to the polar configuration rather than retrograde as λ may imply.</p><p>It is worth noting that the suggested discrepancies in λ and v sin i ⋆ in three data sets (cf. Section 2.1) still persist in our analysis. For a fair comparison with the A12 result, we repeat the same analyses for the W09 and N09 data only including RVs taken over the same night, but the values of λ and v sin i ⋆ do not change significantly. Since [Vol. , we have used the same model of the RM effect and the same priors from the Kepler photometry for the three sets of data, our results confirm that the discrepancy comes from the RV data themselves. As A12 discussed, such a discrepancy may originate from some physics that is not included in the current model of the RM effect, but its origin is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>As a by-product of the spin-orbit analysis, we have found that HAT-P-7b has a small but non-zero orbital eccentricity, e = 0.005 ± 0.001 (weighted mean of the three data sets), which is consistent with e = 0.0055 +0.007 −0.0033 obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al. (2014)</ref>. Our constraint on e comes from the duration and mid-time of the occultation of HAT-P-7b relative to those of the transit, along with the constraint on the mean stellar density ρ ⋆ from asteroseismology. This approach is justified by the fact that ρ ⋆ from the transit and occultation alone shows a reasonable agreement with the model stellar density ρ ⋆,m derived independently from asteroseismology. The origin of this non-zero e may deserve further theoretical consideration because the tides are expected to damp e rapidly for such a close-in planet like HAT-P-7b.</p></div>

Our finding is important in two aspects; 1) this is the first quantitative measurement of ψ, instead of λ, for multi-planetary systems, except for the Solar system. 2) Kepler-25 is the first system that exhibits the significant spin-orbit misalignment among the multi-transiting systems with a mainsequence host star, while it is the second example if we consider the systems with a red-giant host star, Kepler-56.</p><p>The spin-orbit misalignment in systems with multiple transiting planets is particularly interesting for the following reason. Considering the transit probabilities of multiple planets, planets' orbital planes are likely to be coplanar in multi-transiting systems, and hence presumably trace their natal protoplanetary disks. The spinorbit misalignment in such systems, therefore, could be a clue to the processes that tilt a stellar spin relative to its protoplanetary disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bate et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lai et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Batygin, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>In this context, the orbital inclinations of the other two planets <ref type="bibr">(Kepler-25b and Kepler-25d)</ref> relative to that of Kepler-25c would help the interpretation of the observed misalignment. They may be constrained from the analysis of TTVs and Transit Duration Variations (TDVs), along with orbital RVs to constrain the orbit of the outer non-transiting planet d. In this paper, we did not model these phenomena because our main concern is the determination of the spin-orbit angle. It should be noted, however, that the independent information on ρ ⋆ from asteroseismology benefits the TTV analysis as well because TTVs are sensitive to the mean stellar density and orbital eccentricity of the planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sanchis-Ojeda et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Masuda, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that both HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25 are relatively hot stars with T eff &gt; ∼ 6300 K and in line with the observed trend that the spin-orbit misalignments are preferentially found around stars with T eff &gt; 6250 K ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Winn et al., 2010)</ref>. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers et al. (2012)</ref> suggested that temporal variations of the stellar rotation due to internal gravity waves could explain this empirical trend, we found no evidence to support this scenario for the two systems. Regarding HAT-P-7, we compared the rotational splitting from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7</ref> with that from Q0 to Q2 (results from the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Oshagh et al., 2013</ref>), but found no evidence of significant variations. Although results using only Q0 to Q2 have large uncertainties, this may indicate that the rotation remains constant over time. Moreover, we tightly constrained the rotation of Kepler-25 and showed that outer layers certainly rotate at constant velocity. This is incompatible with the scenario suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rogers et al. (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Summary</head><p>The major purpose of the present paper is two-fold. The first is to develop and describe a detailed methodology of determining the three-dimensional spin-orbit angle ψ for transiting planetary systems. The other is to demonstrate the power of the methodology by applying to the two specific systems, HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25.</p><p>The application of asteroseismology to exoplanetary systems is now becoming popular. It is particularly useful in determining the stellar inclination i ⋆ with respect to the line-of-sight. Combined with the orbital inclination i orb determined for transiting systems, and with the projected spin-orbit angle λ via the spectroscopic observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the joint analysis presented in this paper indeed enables the determination of ψ, rather than λ. While the observed distribution of λ for more than 70 transiting systems [e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">figure 7</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Xue et al. (2014)</ref>] already put tight constraints on planetary migration scenarios, that of ψ is even more useful because it is free from the projection effect. As we discussed, HAT-P-7 seems to host a polar-orbit planet instead of a retrograde one as naively suspected from the observed λ ≈ 180 • . The determination of ψ is also important for multi-transiting planetary systems where all the planets are supposed to share the same orbital plane; large ψ in such a system indicates that the stellar obliquity experiences significant tilt with respect to the protoplanetary disk that would be the orbital plane of the planets. This turned out to be the case for Kepler-25 as we discussed in the previous section. While it may be premature to consider the statistics at this point, it is tempting to note that two out of the six multi-transiting systems with measured spin-orbit angles are shown to be significantly misaligned. The mis- . Even if the spin-orbit misalignment is rare, the physical mechanism for its origin is an interesting theoretical question. If it indeed turns out to be fairly common, it will pose a serious challenge to all viable theories of the formation and evolution of multi-planetary systems.</p><p>In addition to the determination of ψ, the joint analysis improves the accuracy and precision of numerous system parameters for a specific target. In turn, any discrepancy among the separate analyses strongly points to a certain physical process which needs to be taken into account in the detailed modeling. This would open a new window for the exploration of the origin and evolution of planetary systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_9"><head>mic studies;</head><label></label><figDesc>Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2010) used Q0 and Q1 Kepler data (≈ 60 days long) and reported M ⋆ = 1.520 ± 0.036 M ⊙ . They fitted individual frequen- cies corrected from the surface effects (Kjeldsen et al., 2008) and they used the ASTEC evolutionary code with a method and physics similar to what we adopted in the present paper 4 . Oshagh et al. (2013) carried out an analysis of HAT-P-7 using Kepler Q0 to Q2 (144 days long). Their approach slightly differs from ours as they did a non-adiabatic frequency calculation. They reported M ⋆ = 1.415 ± 0.020 M ⊙ . Furthermore Van Eylen et al. (2012) used Kepler data from Q0 to Q11 and reported M ⋆ = 1.361 ± 0.021 M ⊙ . While our model values are con- sistent with those quoted in Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2010) within 2σ, the other estimates are significantly dif- ferent. Thus we discuss the issue below. First of all, Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2010) and our study result in consistent mean stellar densities 5 at 1σ. In contrast, Oshagh et al. (2013) obtain ρ ⋆,m = (0.2778 ± 0.0059)×10 3 kg m −3 and Van Eylen et al. (2012) ρ ⋆,m = (0.2781 ± 0.0017) × 10 3 kg m −3 , which are consis- tent within 1σ. While the differences between Oshagh et al. (2013) and the present study may be due to the non-adiabatic treatment of model frequencies and to the data quality as well, this cannot explain the low mass found by Van Eylen et al. (2012). Nevertheless, although the model in figure 2 of Van Eylen et al. (2012) has a small value of χ 2 , it does not seem to reproduce accurately their 4 Opacity tables and some nuclear reaction rates are different. 5 Using an MCMC analysis, they found M⋆ = 1.520 ± 0.036 M ⊙ and R⋆ = 1.991 ± 0.018 R ⊙ , corresponding to ρ⋆,m = (0.2707 ± 0.0010) × 10 3 kg m −3 , while our model implies ρ⋆,m = (0.2708 ± 0.0035) × 10 3 kg m −3 .</figDesc></figure>

Vertical dot-dash lines indicate the credible interval (orange) and the median (black) of the measured inclination (cf. Figure 7).

We obtain i ⋆ = 66. • 7 +12. • 1 −7. • 4 within a 68% confidence interval. The precision on i ⋆ is much higher than for HAT-P-7, despite a lower signal-to-noise ratio. This is because the rotational splitting is at least twice greater (δν s ≃ 1.72 µHz). The multiplets of each degree are disentangled (δν s ≈ Γ ≃ 2.5µHz), and the mode profile E(l, m, i ⋆ ) becomes very sensitive to the stellar inclination (cf. Figure 10). The radius derived from the best-fit model allows us to directly compare the spectroscopically determined radial velocity, v sini ⋆ , quoted by Marcy et al. (2014) against our value. As shown in Figure 9, the spectroscopic v sin i ⋆ is consistent with the maximum location of the joint PDF. Moreover, the rotational kernels of the l = 1 and l = 2 modes show that the measured rotational splitting is as much sensitive to the rotation in the convective envelope as into the radiative zone. The modes are however not sensitive to the rotation in the inner convective region. This indicates that the radiative layer and the outer convective region are rotating uniformly, with the same velocity as the surface. Finally, note that H(n, l, m) autocorrelation of the timeseries does not show evidence for stellar activity.</figDesc></figure>
