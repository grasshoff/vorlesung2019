				<p>We analyze the possibilities of detection of hypothetical exoplanets in coorbital motion from synthetic radial velocity (RV) signals, taking into account different types of stable planar configurations, orbital eccentricities and mass ratios. For each nominal solution corresponding to small-amplitude oscillations around the periodic solution, we generate a series of synthetic RV curves mimicking the stellar motion around the barycenter of the system. We then fit the data sets obtained assuming three possible different orbital architectures: (a) two planets in coorbital motion, (b) two planets in a 2/1 mean-motion resonance (MMR), and (c) a single planet. We compare the resulting residuals and the estimated orbital parameters. For synthetic data sets covering only a few orbital periods, we find that the discrete radial velocity signal generated by a coorbital configuration could be easily confused with other configurations/systems, and in many cases the best orbital fit corresponds to either a single planet or two bodies in a 2/1 resonance. However, most of the incorrect identifications are associated to dynamically unstable solutions. We also compare the orbital parameters obtained with two different fitting strategies: a simultaneous fit of two planets and a nested multi-Keplerian model. We find that, even for data sets covering over ten orbital periods, the nested models can yield incorrect orbital configurations (sometimes close to fictitious mean-motion resonances) that are nevertheless dynamically stable and with orbital eccentricities lower than the correct nominal solutions. Finally, we discuss plausible mechanisms for the formation of coorbital configurations, by the interaction between two giant planets and an inner cavity in the gas disk. For equal mass planets, both Lagrangian and anti-Lagrangian configurations can be obtained from same initial condition depending on final time of integration.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The possible existence of exoplanets in coorbital motion has fascinated planetary scientists for several years. Since the diversity of exoplanetary configurations continue to surprise us, even more than 15 years after the discovery of Peg51b, and it seems almost natural to expect Trojan planets to exist somewhere and the announcement of their discovery to be only a matter of time. Probably the first detailed analysis of hypothetical coorbital planets is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laughlin and Chambers (2002)</ref>. They studied three types of coorbital configurations: tadpole orbits (around L4 and L5 equilateral points), horse-shoe configurations and "eccentric resonances". They proposed to distinguish between coorbital and single planet fits from RV data by observing residuals from long-term observations (more than ten orbital periods), because the coorbital configurations have large mutual interactions due to resonant motion.</p><p>For systems with more than one planet, it is well known that the existence of resonant motion may be possible evidence of a past large-scale planetary migration due to interactions with the gaseous disk. Although their importance is unquestionable, it is still intriguing why some commensurabilities are very populated (e.g., 2/1 MMR) and others that are currently empty (particularly the 1/1 MMR).</p><p>Lagrange (1873) discovered stable solutions for three massive bodies such that at all times their relative positions are located in the vertices of an equilateral triangle of variable size <ref type="bibr">(L4 and L5 solutions)</ref>. Linear stability analyses traditionally focused on the restricted three-body problem (where one of the masses vanishes, e.g Morais 2001, <ref type="bibr">Namouni et al. 1999</ref> and references therein). Recently, <ref type="bibr">Nauenberg (2002)</ref> numerically investigated the dynamical stability of general three body problem as a function of the eccentricity of the orbits and the Rouths' mass parameter. The resonant solutions were found stable when m 1 +m 2 M ⊙ 0.038 and up to ec-centricities ∼ 0.6. The existence of such periodic orbits in the general three-body problem also was derived for example in <ref type="bibr">Siegel &amp; Moser (1971)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref>. As mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref>, horse-shoe orbits are stable for planetary masses up to ∼ 0.4mjup, and despite first impression, Keplerian fit are good enough to reveal their radial velocity signature with only four orbital periods. We note also that those type of orbits named "eccentric resonances", are simply an effect of angular momentum conservation in a coplanar three-body problem, that predicts when the eccentricity of one planet is maximum the other eccentricity reach a minimum and they have high amplitude of oscillation of resonant angles.</p><p>More recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hadjidemetriou et al. (2009)</ref> studied the properties of motion close to a periodic orbit by computing the Poincaré map on a surface of section. They constructed the symmetric families of stable and unstable motion describing one previous unknown symmetric configuration in the general problem, the Quasi-Satellite (QS) solution.</p><p>In a previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Giuppone et al. 2010</ref>), we studied the stability regions and families of periodic orbits of two planets in the vicinity of a 1/1 MMR, using numerical integrations and developing a semi-analytical method. We considered different ratios of planetary masses and orbital eccentricities, although we assumed that both planets share the same orbital plane (coplanar motion). As result we identified two separate regions of stability, symmetric and asymmetric types of motion easily described with the behavior of resonant angles (σ, ∆̟) = (λ2−λ1, ̟2 − ̟1), summarizing 1</p><p>• Quasi-Satellite region: correspond to oscillations around a fixed point located at (σ, ∆̟) = (0, 180 • ) independent of mass ratio. Although not present for quasi-circular trajectories, they fill a considerable portion of the phase space in the case of moderate to high eccentricities.</p><p>• Lagrangian region: Two distinct types of asymmetric periodic orbits exists in which both σ and ∆̟ oscillate around values different from 0 or 180 • . The first is the classical equilateral Lagrange solution associated to local maxima of the averaged Hamiltonian function. Independently of the mass ratio m2/m1 and their eccentricities, these solutions are always located at (σ, ∆̟) = (±60 • , ±60 • ). However, the size of the stable domain decreases rapidly for increasing eccentricities, being practically negligible for ei &gt; 0.7.</p><p>The second type of asymmetric solutions correspond to local minimum of the averaged Hamiltonian function. They were named Anti-Lagrangian points (AL4 and AL5) and, for low eccentricities, are located at (σ, ∆̟) = (±60 • , ∓120 • ). Each is connected to the classical Li solution through the σ-family of periodic orbits in the averaged system (a family of solutions where the angle σ has zero amplitude of oscillation, e.g. <ref type="bibr">Michtchenko et al. 2008ab</ref>). Contrary to the classical equilateral Lagrange solution, their location in the plane (σ, ∆̟) varies with the planetary mass ratio and eccentricities. Although their stability domain also shrinks for increasing values of ei, they do so at a slower rate than the classical Lagrangian solutions, and are still appreciable for eccentricities are high as ∼ 0.7. An empirical relation exist for eccentricities below 0.6 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Giuppone et al. 2010</ref>, Hadjidemetriou &amp; Voyatzis 2011) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We recommend see the Figs. 2 and 5 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Giuppone et al. (2010)</ref> in order to easily identify these kind of coorbital motions in same plane of astrocentric parameters. We center this work on L 4 and AL 4 configurations since, due to symmetry consideration, they give same results as L 5 and AL 5 respectively.</p><p>e1 ≃ m2 m1 e2.</p><p>In this paper we address the question of extrasolar Trojans, both from its detectability and possible origin. In a recent work, <ref type="bibr">Anglada-Escude et al. (2010)</ref> showed that two planets in a 2/1 MMR resonance could mimic a single planet in a more eccentric orbit. We wonder whether the opposite could also occur, and if two planets in a coorbital configuration could give similar RV signals as other dynamical systems including the 2/1 resonance. In Section 2 we review the radial velocity signal generated by such systems and how they can be easily mistaken by the signal generated by a single planet. In the following section we select representative configurations and generate synthetics data-sets for several mass ratio. Sections 4 analyzes the dynamical stability of the different possible configurations, while the dispersion of the best-fit parameters is discussed in Section 5. A comparison between two different strategies for planetary detection (two-planet fit vs. nested Keplerian fits) is presented in Section 6. Finally, a possible formation mechanism of extrasolar coorbitals is discussed in Section 7, where we present a series of numerical simulations (both hydro and N-body) of two planet systems immersed in a gaseous disk with an inner gap. Conclusions close the paper in Section 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">KEPLERIAN RADIAL VELOCITY EQUATIONS</head><p>First we need to understand some aspects involved in the RV signal produced by two planets in coorbital motions, assuming unperturbed Keplerian motion. Consider two planets with masses m1 and m2 in coplanar orbits around a star with mass m0 = M⊙. Let ai denote the semimajor axes, ei the eccentricities, λi the mean longitudes, ̟i the longitudes of pericenter, Mi the mean anomaly and fi the true anomalies. All orbital elements are assumed astrocentric and osculating.</p><p>The suitable angular variables for coorbital motion are defined by σ = λ2 −λ1 and ∆̟ = ̟2 −̟1. Disregarding mutual interactions between the planets, the radial velocity of the star is the sum of the individual Keplerian contributions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beaugé et al. 2007</ref>).</p></div>

Even though the radial velocity of a star perturbed by the two planets near the periodic orbit (i.e QS, Li and ALi) is not given by a single periodic signal, we may ask under what circumstances this signal could be mimic by a single planet orbiting the star or even two planets in other configurations.</p><p>To address this question we can use the same approach than Anglada- <ref type="bibr">Escude et al. (2010)</ref> rearranging the Keplerian contributions from each planet. Using the expansions to first order in eccentricities for the true anomaly f (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murray &amp; Dermott, 1999</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">sin(fi) = sin(Mi) + ei sin(2Mi) cos(fi) = cos(Mi) + ei cos(2Mi) − ei,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and expanding  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(9)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> .</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">cos (fi + ̟i) = cos (̟i + Mi) + ei cos (2Mi + ̟i) − ei cos ̟i,<label>(</label></formula><p>recalling that λi = ̟i + Mi and substituting <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(4)</ref> into <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> we finally obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Vr ≃ K1 cos λ1 + e1 cos (2λ1 − ̟1) + K2 cos λ2 + e2 cos (2λ2 − ̟2)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Now, we suppose that the previous signal can be mimicked by a single planet.

(1), except for the L4 configuration that always lies in the line segment e1 = e2.</p><p>For other mass ratios, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the equilibrium values of α1, β1 and the corresponding signal K amplitude and eccentricity e (the eccentricity is shown in units of e1). Note that the value of e only varies when the single planet mimics coorbitals in AL4. It is interesting remark that QS configuration could easily mimicked by single planet of circular orbit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ORBITAL FITS AND SYNTHETIC RADIAL VELOCITY</head><p>First we review the differences in radial velocities signals using the Keplerian approximation (2) and N-body integrator, in order to distinguish how important are the mutual interactions and the feasibil- ity of being detected. The top frame of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows three synthetic curves covering four orbital periods for equally mass planets (mi = mJup) in QS, L4 and AL4 configurations. The bottom frame of the same figure shows the error that would be obtained if the RV signal was calculated assuming constant Keplerian orbits. Even after four orbital periods, the error remains below ∼ 4 m/s. As expected, the mutual perturbations would be even smaller if the individual mass were reduced. To test the mimicking effect described in the previous section, we selected six nominal solutions near exact fixed points chosen from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Giuppone et al. (2010)</ref>, three with m1 = m2 and three other with m1 = m2/3. In all cases we fixed m2 = 1mJup. Initial conditions are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. In order to test the validity of our expressions (5) and (7)-(8), constructed from a first-order expansion in the eccentricities, here we deliberately chose high eccentric orbits (e1 = 0.3). If our predictions prove correct in these cases, we can be assured that they will be valid for lower eccentricities as well.</p><p>For each nominal configuration we generated a synthetic RV curve describing the stellar motion around the barycenter of the system. The curve was then represented with a discrete sampling of N observation times ti distributed randomly, according to an homogeneous distribution (thus avoiding aliases in data from daily/seasonal observations, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dawson &amp; Fabrycky, 2010)</ref>. In each data point the nominal RV value Vr(ti) was displaced to a new value Vr i = Vr(ti) + N (0, ǫ) following a Gaussian distribution with constant variance ǫ 2 . The resulting synthetic data set was the used as input for our orbital fitting code PISA (Pikaia genetic algorithm + simulated annealing) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beaugé et al. 2008</ref>). Since our data sets cover only four orbital periods, the orbital fit was obtained assuming noninteracting Keplerian orbits. 1000 different data sets were generated for each orbital configuration (QS, L4, AL4) and each mass ratio m2/m1. Each synthetic data set consisted of N = 100 data points covering a total of four orbital periods. The results shown here were obtained adopting ǫ = 3 m/s, a value similar to the present day errors in detections programs (including stellar jitter). The same analysis was repeated for other values of ǫ, showing similar results although the dispersion around the mean values decreased/increased as function of ǫ (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Giuppone et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>As noticed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laughlin &amp; Chambers (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Gozdziewski &amp; Konacki( 2006)</ref>, two planets in a coorbital configuration produce only one peak in a Fourier spectrum, meaning that it could easily be confused with a single planet (obviously more massive than the individual components). On the other hand, Anglada-Escude et al. <ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref> found that two planets in circular orbits near a 2/1 MMR could also be falsely detected as a single planet in an eccentric orbit. So, our question here is the following: is it possible for two planets in different coorbital configurations (QS, L4 or AL4) to be falsely identified as a single planet or as two bodies in a 2/1 resonance? To test this idea, each of the synthetic data sets was fitted assuming: (i) a single planet, (ii) two planets in coorbital configuration (without specifying the type) and (iii) two planets in the vicinity of a 2/1 MMR. The resulting values of wrms (weighted rms) for the 1000 data sets associated to each nominal solution are displayed as histograms in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Each frame corresponds to a given nominal solution and mass ratio, while the color code for the histograms corresponds to the fitted orbital configurations. For example, in the top left-hand plot we constructed 1000 synthetic data sets from a nominal quasi-satellite configuration of two planets with equal masses. The data sets where then fitted assuming the three different possible configurations, the resulting values of wrms plotted. The colored histograms show the distribution of the residuals of each assumed configuration. As we can see, the results corresponding to QS solutions show to smallest distribution of wrms (both in mean and dispersion), very similar to the adopted value of ǫ. Recall that wrms ∼ ǫ is usually employed as evidence that not only the fit is satisfactory but also that the assumed planetary model is correct.</p><p>Although for nominal QS solutions and m1 = m2 the coorbital configuration gives the best fits, this is not always the case. For systems with a more massive outer body (m2/m1 = 3), and for any nominal coorbital motion, we find that all three assumed orbital solutions given practically the same error distribution (righthand side plots). In other words, it seems that for m2 &gt; m1 the difference in short-term RV signals of one planet or two bodies in either a 1/1 or 2/1 MMR are virtually indistinguishable. For equal-  mass planets, the picture is similar, specially if the nominal configuration corresponds to two planets in L4. However, two bodies in other coorbital configurations (i.e. QS or AL4) appear easier to identify. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows an example. The top frame shows a synthetic data set constructed from a nominal solution of two planets in a stable AL4 configuration. The three different fits are superimposed in different colors and show practically no difference. The corresponding distribution of residuals are shown in the bottom frame, also displaying no significant difference. The best fit planetary masses and orbital elements of each orbital configuration are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE FITS</head><p>Although a given coorbital pair may be falsely identified as another orbital configuration, we still do not know whether all possible alternatives are equally dynamically stable. To analyze this point, we numerical integrated each of the best fits for a time span covering 10 4 orbital periods, and calculated the amplitude of oscillation of    <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>the resonant angle σ as well as the difference in longitudes of pericenter ∆̟ = ̟2−̟1. In the case of coorbital motion the resonant critical angle is basically the synodic angle σ = λ2 − λ1, while for the 2/1 MMR we have chosen the so-called principal resonant angle</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">σ = 2λ2 − λ1 − ̟1.</formula><p>The <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> presents a statistical analysis of the dynamical evolution of all the best fits. We denote the dynamical behavior as "resonant" if the system is stable during the full integration span and both σ and ∆̟ show small-to-moderate amplitudes of oscillation (&lt; 50 • ) around the fixed point. We call librators those configurations where the resonant angle librates but the secular angle circulates. "Non-resonant" configurations are those for which both angles circulate. Finally, "unstable" configurations are those that led to collisions or escapes of one of the bodies within the integration span.</p><p>The left-hand side of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> describes the dynamics of the coorbital fits. For both mass ratios, the QS solutions appear the most robust. For equal mass planets, all the fits correctly yield stable resonant quasi-satellite orbits, fully consistent with the nominal solution. For m2/m1 = 3, however, 13% of the synthetic data sets led to unstable coorbital solutions. The reliability of the fits decreases when the adopted nominal solution is L4 and even worse when it is AL4. In the latter case, more than a third of the data sets led to unstable solutions.</p><p>The right-hand side of the <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> now shows results for those fits that incorrectly identified the signal as that generated by two planets in the vicinity of the 2/1 MMR. For equal mass planets, the best fits are highly unstable for both QS and L4 nominal configurations, while the AL4 data give a 63 % of stable configurations but with both resonant angles circulating. When we increase the mass ratio, the compatible 2/1 MMR solutions are sightly more stable although again correspond mainly to non-resonant configurations. Again, the QS and L4 configurations are the most unfavorable for being labeled as 2/1 MMR solutions, although for asymmetric equilateral Lagrange solutions, a small fraction (∼ 8%) of 2/1 MMR solutions show stable librators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISPERSION OF THE BEST-FIT PARAMETERS</head><p>Although the best fits assuming two planets in a 2/1 MMR have proved to be largely unstable, and thus difficult to confuse with coorbital planets, we have no clear indication of the cause of the instability. In this section we will analyze the planetary masses and eccentricities obtained form the diverse best fits, and compare them with the nominal solutions.</p><p>Results are presented in Figures 6-8 for equal mass planets (m1 = m2 = mJup). Each corresponds to a different nominal coorbital solution (QS, L4 and AL4, respectively), and is divided into four frames. The top graphs show histograms with the distribution of the eccentricities (left) and deduced planetary masses (right). Masses are in units of mJup. Different colors and line types correspond to different configuration or bodies (see caption for details). The two bottom plots show the dispersion of the eccentricities (left) and relation between the mass and eccentricities (right). Once again, different colors are used for different configurations/bodies.</p><p>For a nominal QS configuration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>), the best-fit parameters assuming a coorbital solution show a considerable dispersion: approximately 0.04 in eccentricities and 0.1mJup in masses. However, there appears to be no appreciable systematic error and both distributions seem symmetric with respect to the nominal values. The single-planet fits show a very steep distribution around e ≃ 0 and m ≃ 2. To understand this result, we can analyze the expected RV signal. For a QS configuration we have σ = 0 and ∆̟ = 180 • . Moreover, from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> we have that equal mass planets imply e1 = e2, from which we expect K1 = K2. Consequently, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(7)</ref> leads to</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">Vr = 2K1 cos λ.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>This tells us that two planets in QS orbit produce the same signal as one planet with semi-amplitude K = 2K1 and eccentricity e = 0. The dispersion of the best fits show an excellent agreement with this prediction, yielding a planet with m = m1 +m2 in a quasi-circular orbit. Surprisingly, the dispersion of the different fits is smaller than obtained assuming (correct) QS orbits. The distribution of the 2/1 MMR fits, shown in the histograms with dashed lines, show a strong bimodal shape. Approximately half of the best fits give masses in the vicinity of (m1, m2) ∼ (2, 0.5) and eccentricities around (e1, e2) ∼ (0, 0.3). The other half of the solutions clutter around (m1, m2) ∼ (2, 0.1) and (e1, e2) ∼ (0.1, 0.8). This indicates the existence of two local minima in the residual function with similar values of the wrms and similar extension in the parameter space. Small differences in the synthetic data sets would then highlight one or the other, thereby yielding either two planets in low-to-moderate eccentricities or a solution in which one of them is almost parabolic. However, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, practically all solutions are unstable.</p><p>Results for a nominal L4 configuration are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure  7</ref>. Contrary to the previous case, the coorbital fits now show a very narrow dispersion around the correct solution, implying that the RV      signal of two planets in an equilateral configuration is more robust than two bodies in QS. Applying equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(7)</ref> to this case yields α1 = α2 = 30 • , and the same RV signal could also be associated to a single planet with</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Vr = √ 3K1 cos λ + e cos (2λ − ̟)<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where e = e1 = e2 is the value of the eccentricity of the original bodies. The distribution of the best single-planet fits follow this prediction and show a very sharp peak at (m, e) = (∼ 1.7, 0.3). The 2/1 MMR best fits always give two planets with a large mass ratio. The largest body has mass and orbital elements similar to the single planet fit, while its companion has very small mass and very high eccentricity (K → σ and e → 1). Thus, this second planet does little more than attempt to resolve the residuals of the single planet solution. It is therefore no surprise that practically all resonant configurations are highly unstable.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref> shows the results obtained from a nominal AL4 configuration. Initial conditions show a small amplitude oscillation around the equilibrium solution (σ, ∆̟) = (95.4 • , 257.46 • ) which, substituting into equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(7)</ref>, leads to an equivalent single planet solution with</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Vr = 1.34K1 cos λ + 1.24 e1 cos (2λ − ̟) ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>which results in the strong peak in the mass and eccentricity histograms. However, all one-planet solutions have much larger residuals than the coorbital solution (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>). Once again, the solutions assuming a 2/1 MMR generate a bimodal distribution, with part of the solutions (∼ 33%) with high eccentricities and consequently unstable. However, contrary to the previous cases, almost two thirds of the fits lead to configurations that are dynamically stable, even if the resonant angles are in circulation. These correspond to m1 ∼ 0.4 and e1 &lt; 0.2. The same procedure was also followed for synthetic data sets with m2/m1 = 3 and e2 = e1/3. Results showed very similar traits as those presented for equal-mass planets, except for a larger dispersion in the parameters. This larger dispersion diminishes the proportion of stable coorbital fits (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>) but also allows for a significant number of stable fits assuming two planets in a 2/1 MMR. In the case of a nominal AL4 configuration, almost one third of the synthetic data sets gave stable 2/1 configurations, although only a fraction of these corresponded to libration. .  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">NESTED VS. TWO-PLANET FITS</head><p>Apart from possible misidentification of coorbital planets as other configurations, the 1:1 MMR also appears sensitive to the strategy adopted for the fitting algorithm. There are two commonly used procedures to fit a two-planet solution into a given RV data set. One possibility, the simultaneous two-planet fit, assumes the existence of two masses from the beginning, and attempts to fit the data set with a model with two periodic signals. The second approach, sometimes referred to as the nested model first attempts to fit one planet into the data. If the residuals are too large or if its Fourier spectrum shows a significant periodicity, then a second planet is fitted into the reduced data. This typically is adopted if the largest amplitude of the spectrum is larger than a given false alarm probability (FAP). In a perfect world, both procedures should give the same results, or at least very similar to each other. This appears to be the case for non-resonant planets or even for planets in the 2/1 MMR (see the analysis done by Beaugé et al 2008 for the HD82943 system). However, as we will show below, they can lead to completely different solutions in the case of coorbital planets.</p><p>Using the same type of nominal configurations shown before, we generated new synthetic RV data sets. We incorporated two dif- ferences: first, the orbital period of the planets was raised to 400 days. Second, the data covered 12 years (10 complete periods) with N = 200 randomly distributed observations assuming ǫ=5 m/s. We repeated the same test fits as in the previous section with similar results.</p><p>We now use the same data to compare both fitting strategies. Results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. All the periodograms were calculated using DCDFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ferraz-Mello 1981)</ref> which allows a treatment of unequally spaced data. In the top and middle frames the power spectra are normalized so that the total area is unity. The top graph shows the periodogram of the original data, where the main 400 day signal is clearly visible. The middle frame shows the power spectra of the residuals after a single planet fit. The dashed horizontal line corresponds to a false Alarm Probability of FAP = 10 −4 , and was estimated using the Quast algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ferraz-Mello &amp; Quast 1987)</ref>. We note the existence of peak corresponding to a period near P = 1 3 P1 which appears statistically relevant. After performing a second planet fit the wrms was reduced from 6.6 m/s to 5.6 m/s. Finally, the lower frame shows periodograms of the residuals after both two-planet fits. Black curves show the results employing a nested model, while the red curve correspond to a simultaneous two-planet model. The power spectra are quite similar and no additional periodicity is observed. The resulting masses and planetary parameters of both models are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. Although both results are very different, not only are the wrms very similar, but the incorrect system derived from the nested model is also dynamically stable. In fact, the orbital eccentricities derived from the nested model are actually significantly lower than the nominal values. Finally, we found no appreciable difference by using N-body fits for this data set.</p><p>The top frame of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows, in blue, the data synthetic points of the fictitious QS configuration. The black curve presents the expected RV signal from a nested two-planet fit, while the red curve shows corresponds to a simultaneous fit of both planets. The bottom plot gives the resulting o − c showing practically no difference between both fits.</p></div>

They included a solar nebula gas drag and considered planetesimals with diameters ranging from ∼1 to ∼1000 km.

After brief period of chaotic interaction characterized by scattering, orbital exchanges and collisions, some cases led to coorbital planets occupying either horse-shoe or tadpole orbits. If the initial separation between bodies was taken ∆ ∼ 5R Hill such configurations occurred in 20% of the runs, while the probability increased to 80% if the initial separation was reduced to ∆ = 4R Hill . They also found that planets sometimes evolved from horse-shoe to tadpole configurations, although some coorbital configurations were shot-lived, ultimately leading to disruption and escapes of one of its members.</p><p>Beaugé et al. (2007) studied the in-situ formation of terrestrial-like Trojan planets starting from a swarm of planetesimals initially located around the Lagrangian point L4 of a massive planet. They analyzed different masses, initial conditions and both gas-free and gas-rich scenarios. The swarm of proto-trojans were initially located within the L4 tadpole region with total masses ranging from 1 to 3m⊕. The gas interaction was modeled using linear and non-linear gas drags in a N-body code, adjusting the parameters to reproduce preliminary tests done with the FARGO hydrodynamical code. Their main results showed that the accretional process within the coorbital region is not very efficient, and the mass of the final Trojan planet never seems to exceed 0.6 m⊕.</p><p>Hadjidemetriou &amp; Voyatzis (2011) studied the evolution of a QS system under the additional effects of a gas drag.

We thus consider two planets initially far from mean-motion commensurabilities that migrate inwards, ultimately becoming locked in resonance. We assume that the disk possesses an inner cavity which acts as a planetary trap, halting the migration of the massive bodies. For simplicity, we consider a constant surface density Σo outside the cavity, and a constant value Σi inside. The density jump is set at a radial distance r = 1 (arbitrary units) from the star. Thus, we characterize the density jump in the disk by two main parameters: the density ratio F = Σo/Σi and the width ∆ of the cavity edge (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11)</ref>.</p><p>Our main simulations were performed using the FARGO-2D public hydro-code, whose basic algorithm may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Masset (2000)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Preliminary N-body simulations</head><p>Before undertaking the main hydro-simulations, we wish to analyze what disk properties (Σo, F , ∆, etc.) and planetary parameters (masses, initial separation, etc.) are compatible with the formation of coorbital solutions. Since such a broad sweeping of the parameter space is extremely time-consuming for a hydro-code, we employed an N-body code for a series of preliminary runs. The interaction between the planets and the disk was approximated by a Type I migration following the semi-analytical model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tanaka et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tanaka and Ward (2004)</ref>. In the case of a smooth density profile, explicit expressions for the forces acting on the planetary masses can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ogihara et al. (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Since we will be working with planetary masses smaller than one Saturn-mass, Type I migration is expected to be a fair descrip-tion of the tidal interactions with the disk. However, we stress that these N-body simulations are not expected to be accurate, but are used solely as guidelines for the full hydro-simulations introduced in the following sections.</p><p>The inner cavity in the disk may be approximated with an hyperbolic tangent, such that ln Σ(r) = Ca tanh x + C b with</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">x = r − 1 ∆<label>(17)</label></formula><p>and where the coefficients are given by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows two representations of Σ(r) with a test cavity (edge at r = 1). The black curve was generated with FARGO (see Benítez-Llambay et al. 2011 for details), while the red curve was obtained applying equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>. Both appear very similar, although the analytical function has a smoother trend near the edges of the cavity.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Ca = 1 2 (ln Σo − ln Σi) ; C b = 1 2 (ln Σo + ln Σi).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>Having an explicit functional form for the density profile, we can modify Tanaka's equations for the corotational torque to reproduce the contribution generated by a density jump in the disk. This was done following the calculations deduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Masset et al. (2006a)</ref>, and the resulting expressions were incorporated into our N-body code. With this tool we were then able to reproduce the dynamical behavior of massive planets near the density jump without needing to artificially halt the planet at a given orbital distance from the star. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Benítez-Llambay et al. (2011)</ref> showed that the real population of close-in exoplanets is consistent with a disk inner cavity located at r0 ∼ 0.01 AU. However, since our N-body simulations will be used primarily as a stepping stone into hydro-simulations, it is preferable to scale the initial conditions to r0 = 1. The Appendix shows the scale transformations necessary for the gas density and time units to ensure the same dynamics. For example, assuming a typical surface density for the disk of Σ ∼ 5800 gr/cm 2 at r = 1 AU, the corresponding value at any arbitrary spatial scaling parameter r0 gives Σ = 6.4 × 10 −4 M⊙r −2 0 , where r0 is given in AU. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the results of several simulations using our modified N-body code with a density jump centered at r = r0 = 1 and with a half-width of ∆ = 2H/r. Throughout all our simulations, both N-body and hydro, we assumed a disk scale-height equal to H/r = 0.05 and a depth of the cavity equal to F = Σo/Σi = 10. The density outside the cavity will be set to Σo = N Σ0 with N a positive integer and Σ0 = 10 −3 M⊙ AU −2 . In other words, we will perform simulations with different surface densities given as multiples of an arbitrary base value Σ0.</p><p>All plots shows the time evolution of the ratio of meanmotions n1/n2 between both planets. In the top plot we considered a fixed value of Σo = 15Σ0, but varied the mass ratio of the bodies in the interval m2/m1 ∈ [10 −2 , 10 0 ]. In all cases, the mass of the largest body was equal to one Saturn mass.</p><p>Since m1 has the smallest initial semimajor axis, as well as the largest mass, its orbit suffers a faster orbital decay, and is the first planet to reach the cavity edge. In all the runs, this body was trapped near the center of the density jump (r ∼ 1.05r0) with a small eccentricity. Meanwhile, the outer approaches the cavity edge, encountering successive and increasingly strong mean-motion resonances in its path. The orbital evolution is then dictated by two opposing forces: (i) the differential disk torque that subtracts angular momentum and causes further orbital decay, and (ii) resonant perturbations with the inner mass that can generates conditions for a net increase in the angular momentum. The top plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows that the system is stopped at different mean-motion resonances depending on the mass ratio. For small values of m2/m1 the two planets are trapped in the 3/1 MMR, while the 3/2 commensurability is favored for larger mass ratios. This is expected, since a larger outer mass requires stronger resonance perturbations to counteract the disk torque. For m2/m1 ≥ 0.7, however, it appears no commensurability is sufficiently strong, and both bodies reach the cavity edge and evolve towards a stable coorbital configuration.</p><p>From these results it then appears that coorbital planets may be formed at a density jump in the disk if the mass ratio is sufficiently close to unity. We checked that the same result was obtained for other mass values, considering planets ranging from Neptune to Jupiter analogues.</p><p>The middle plot of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> now analyses the dependence on the value of the surface density Σo outside the cavity, while maintaining the same cavity depth F . Results are shown for two equal <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. Comparison between two hydro-simulation with the same initial conditions (see text for details) but different grid resolutions. The high resolution simulation was constructed with 306 radial zones, while the low resolution run contained only 168 radial zones. Both lead to coorbital configurations with similar global dynamical features mass planets (m1 = m2 = mSat) and four different multiples of the base density Σ0. We note that smaller densities favor resonance trapping in non-coorbital configurations (e.g. 5/4 MMR), but for large values of Σo, typically above Σ1 ∼ 10Σ0, coorbital systems are the usual outcome. Of course there is some dependence on the initial conditions, mainly on the initial separation of the bodies, but these results are surprisingly robust and are representative of most of our runs.</p><p>Finally, the bottom frame shows the dependence on the eccentricity damping force F damp . Although both the circularization time scale τe and the orbital decay time τa have the same dependence with the planetary mass and disk density (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tanaka and Ward 2004)</ref>, it is possible to fictitiously modify the eccentricity damping by changing the tangential force suffered by the bodies. Our main aim in this experiment is to see how the dynamics may be affected by different values of τe/τa. The plot shows two simulations, one with the correct value of τe (black) and one in which the damping rate was reduced by a factor 10 (blue). Although a coorbital configuration was achieved in both cases, the reduced damping generates a much larger amplitude of oscillation of the eccentricities which may ultimately lead to orbital instability. In fact, some of these simulations showed complex exchanges between different types of coorbital solutions (L4, L5, etc).</p><p>In conclusion, our preliminary N-body simulations appear to indicate that coorbital systems of massive planets can be obtained if the mass ratio is sufficiently close to unity and the surface density of the disk is sufficiently high. Although the final outcomes have a certain dependence on the initial conditions (like all resonance trapping phenomena), we repeated the runs for initial separations between 0.5 to 1.7r0, finding no significant changes in the results. Inspired by these results, our next step is to upgrade to hydrodynamical simulations.</p></div>

(2006b)</ref> showed that the horse-shoe zone width in a two-dimentional disk scale as xs = 1.16 q/h. Consequently, xs should increase with the planetary mass. For example if we are interested in the dynamical evolution of Saturn-type planets, we expect that our choice for the spatial resolution should be adequate.</p><p>To test this idea, we performed several simulations with the same initial conditions but different spatial resolutions for the disk, and compared the dynamical evolution of the planets. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> for two Saturn-like planets initially in circular orbits far from the cavity edge and in non-resonant conditions. Both simulations show the same qualitative results, not only in the final outcome of the planets (both runs end in coorbital configurations) but also in the behavior of the eccentricities. The only noticeable change is a slight difference in the radial distance at which the planets are trapped. However, this is not significant and could be explained due to a decrease of the co-rotational torque from a low resolution description of the horse-shoe region.</p><p>Following the predictions of our N-body runs, all our hydrosimulations were done with two equal-mass planets (m1 = m2) in a high-density disk. Initial conditions were varied both with respect to the initial separation between the planets and the initial eccentricities. We also considered different planetary masses between one Earth-mass and one Saturn-mass. Under a wide variety of initial conditions, we found that the orbital evolution of two Saturn-mass planets ultimately lead to the formation of stable coorbital configurations. An example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, where both bodies are trapped in L4/L5-type motion with a libration of both the resonant angle σ = λ2 − λ1 and the difference in longitudes of pericenter ∆̟ = ̟2 − ̟1.</p><p>To test the robustness and stability of the coorbital solutions to additional perturbations, we performed a new series of runs including additional six Earth-mass planets initially far from the cavity edge. The idea behind this set of experiments is to analyze both the orbital evolution of these new bodies, as well as their effects on the two coorbitals. Typical results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>, where each color curve corresponds to a different planet (see inlaid color code). Planets 1 and 2 (i.e. m1 and m2, respectively) are the original Saturn-mass bodies in coorbital motion, while planets 3 through 8 are the new Earth-size masses. Since this type of simulation included smaller masses and a larger population, we employed a high-resolution description of the disk.</p><p>We perceived no significant instability in the coorbitals, and their configuration remained unaffected by the new masses.

The role of scattering between planets as a formation mechanism for coorbitals has already been pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cresswell &amp; Nelson (2006)</ref>.

Top graphs present the temporal evolution of the resonant angle σ = ∆λ = λ2 − λ1 while the middle plots show ∆̟ = ̟2 − ̟1. Once planet 4 is scattered into the cavity, the resonance relation between planets 1 and 2 is temporarily disrupted, resulting in a short-lived circulation of both angles. However, once the Earthmass planet is sent back outside the cavity, the coorbital configuration of the inner planets is reestablished, although around L5 instead of L4. We did some follow-up integrations without hydrodynamical interaction choosing two intermediate stages as initial conditions. The bottom left-hand plot shows the results choosing as initial conditions the system configuration at t = 450 and t = 11450, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper we have analyzed the detectability and possible formation mechanism of hypothetical massive planets in stable coorbital configurations.

For large mass ratios, a correct identification of coorbital configuration is even more complicated and more easy to confuse with the other configurations. In all cases, the residuals of the different systems are comparable, even more so for large mass ratios (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig 4)</ref>.</p><p>Observation data sets covering longer time-spans allow to detect mutual perturbations, but once again the best fits are not always associated to coorbital motion. We have found several cases where other resonant configurations (i.e. 3/1 commensurability) actually give smaller residuals and better results.</p><p>Coorbital motion is not only sensitive to the data set, but also to the fitting procedure. Nested two-planet strategies may also confuse the real dynamics and yield results widely different from the nominal orbits; in this sense simultaneous two-planet fits seem more robust.</p><p>Transit observations should help distinguish coorbitals planets from other solutions.</p><p>Finally, we have found that stable coorbital systems with two massive planets may be formed from originally non-resonant orbits through their interaction with a inner cavity in the protoplanetary disk, as long as the surface density of the disk is sufficiently large. Both our N-body and hydro-simulations indicate a preference towards coorbitals with similar masses (i.e. m1 ∼ m2). In all our simulations with large mass ratios, the smaller planet was either pushed inside the cavity or trapped in a mean-motion commensurability outside the density jump.</p><p>In our problem, however, the dynamical evolution of the planets also includes their interaction with the gas disk, which is specified by the gradient of the total differential torque Γ. If we then desire to preserve the complete dynamics of the system under the spatial rescaling, then the torque must scale as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Γ = α −1 Γ ′ .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>For a type I migration, the total torque is given by Γ(r) ∝ Σ(r)n 2 r 4 , where n is the mean motion. We also assume that the surface density is given by a power law expression of type:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Σ(r) = Σo r r0 η<label>(21)</label></formula><p>for a suitable exponent η. The coefficient Σo denotes the surface density at r = r0. Then, if we apply the spatial and temporal transformations required to preserve the gravitational dynamics, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">Γ = αΣo r ′ r ′ 0 η n ′2 r ′4 = α Σo Σ ′ o Γ ′ .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Therefore, for scale our simulation to a new suitable value of r0, it is necessary to do the transformation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">r = αr ′ (23) t = α 3/2 t ′ (24) Σo = α −2 Σ ′ o (25)</formula><p>For this new radii, time and density value, the dynamics of system is invariant.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
