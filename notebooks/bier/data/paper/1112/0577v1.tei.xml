			<abstract>
				<p>By logging encounters between planetesimals and planets we compute the distribution of encounters in a numerically integrated two planet system that is migrating due to interactions with an exterior planetesimal belt. Capture of an irregular satellite in orbit about a planet through an exchange reaction with a binary planetesimal is only likely when the binary planetesimal undergoes a slow and close encounter with the planet. In our simulations we find that close and slow encounters between planetesimals and a planet primarily occur with the outermost and not innermost planet. Taking care to consider where a planet orbit crossing binary planetesimal would first be tidally disrupted, we estimate the probability of both tidal disruption and irregular satellite capture. We estimate that the probability that the secondary of a binary planetesimal is captured and becomes an irregular satellite about a Neptune mass outer planet is about 1/100 for binaries with masses and separations similar to transneptunian planetesimal binaries. If young exoplanetary debris disks host a binary planetesimal population then outwards migrating outer planets should host captured irregular satellite populations. We discuss interpretation of emission associated with the exoplanet Fomalhaut b in terms of collisional evolution of a captured irregular satellite population that is replenished due to planetary migration.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The majority of irregular satellites about the gas giant planets in our Solar system are in eccentric and high inclination orbits suggesting that likely originated in heliocentric orbit and were later captured into orbit within a planet's Hill sphere (see the review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Jewitt &amp; Haghighipour 2007)</ref>. Irregular satellite populations could have at one time been a source of heavy dust production ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bottke et al. 2010)</ref>. If irregular satellite populations exist in distant planetary systems then exoplanets could be discovered by detecting scattered stellar light from their associated dust clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kennedy &amp; Wyatt 2011</ref>). The color of the visible light from the detected object, Fomalhaut b, in orbit about the nearby star Fomalhaut, is consistent with that of reflected light from the star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>) and so does not originate from the planet itself but could arise from a planetary ring system (as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>), dust cloud associated with irregular satellites (as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt 2011</ref>) or circumplanetary disk akin to the birth site of the Galilean satellites (e.g., as explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Canup &amp; Ward 2002)</ref>.</p><p>We focus on extrasolar planets that are in proximity to a debris disk as this disk could host planetesimals that could be captured by the planets in the system, becoming irregular satellites. Neither the Fomalhaut system or the HR8799 system are likely to have strongly scattered or thick planetesimal disks, the Fomalhaut system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kalas et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kalas et al. , 2008</ref>) because the disk is thin (with disk aspect ratio only h/r ∼ 0.013 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Quillen et al. 2007)</ref>, and the HR8799 system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marois et al. 2010</ref>) because the planets are closely spaced and the time until the planet's cross each others orbits is probably short <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gozdziewski &amp; Migaszewski 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Fabrycky &amp; Murray-Clay 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Moore &amp; Quillen 2011</ref>) implying that the planets have not yet experienced close encounters. The Fomalhaut and HR8799 systems can be considered to be analogs to our solar system prior to the late heavy bombardment epoch of our solar system that involved close approaches between the giant planets (the 'Nice' model; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tsiganis et al. 2005</ref>) and subsequent scattering of the planetesimal disk.</p><p>In our Solar system, the irregular satellites were likely captured during planet/planet close approaches during the late heavy bombardment era ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nesvorny et al. 2007</ref>). However, the recent discovery of a large transneptunian binary population ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Noll et al. 2008</ref>) has motivated study of the exchange reaction mechanism for irregular satellite capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vokrouhlicky et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Philpott et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nogueira et al. 2011</ref>). Irregular satellites in orbit around the giant planets prior to the epoch of late-heavy bombardment were likely lost during close approaches between planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nesvorny et al. 2007</ref>). Little is known about possible irregular satellite populations that could have existed prior to the late heavy bombardment era.</p><p>Both exoplanets Fomalhaut b and HR8799 b are located just interior to dusty disks that are generated from collisions of planetesimals and so are called debris disks ( <ref type="bibr">Marsh et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Su et al. 2009</ref>). Planetesimals originating from these disks can be scattered by the outer planet into orbits that cross the orbits of interior planets. The interaction between planetesimals and planets allows the outer planet to migrate outwards into the planetesimal disk via the exchange of angular momentum between planets and planetesimals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fernandez &amp; Ip 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ida et al. 2000)</ref>. As the outermost planet migrates outwards the population of planet crossing planetesimals can be continually replenished. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref> showed that a dust producing irregular satellite population could be long lived, however they did not explore mechanisms for irregular satellite capture about exoplanets. If the planetesimal disks in these systems contain binary planetesimals, then the exchange reaction mechanism for irregular satellite capture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006</ref>) is a viable mechanism for the capture of irregular satellites about planets from the population of planet-orbit crossing planetesimals. Currently, it is estimated that binaries account for 30% of transneptunian or Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with inclinations &lt; 5 • , and ∼ 5% of the rest of the KBOs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Noll et al. 2008)</ref>. If binary planetesimals are common in extrasolar planetesimal disks then the migration of an outer planet into a planetesimal disk would cause binary planetesimals to cross the orbits of giant planets in the system, facilitating the capture of irregular satellites.</p><p>A planetesimal binary is disrupted inside the Hill sphere of a planet when the distance to the planet is sufficiently small that the planet's tidal force overcomes the gravitational attraction of the binary. The disruption can leave an object in a bound orbit around the planet if the velocity of the binary components is sufficiently large and oriented so as to decrease the energy of the lower mass planetesimal when the binary is disrupted <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vokrouhlicky et al. 2008</ref>). The probability of irregular satellite capture via binary exchanges depends both on the statistics of close approaches and their energies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vokrouhlicky et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Philpott et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nogueira et al. 2011</ref>). In this paper we consider the statistics of close approaches between planetesimals and planets in systems containing two migrating planets. Our goal is to better understand mechanisms for irregular satellite capture that might operate in young exoplanetary systems and prior to the epoch of late heavy bombardment in our Solar system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CLOSE ENCOUNTER DISTRIBUTION FOR A MIGRATING TWO PLANET SYSTEM</head><p>We numerically study systems containing two planets that are in proximity to a planetesimal disk that is exterior to the two planets. We restrict our study to low eccentricity and low inclination systems. We first discuss our numerical integrations. We compute the distribution of the first close encounter that would disrupt a planetesimal binary. We then consider the velocity distribution of these encounters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Numerical Integrations</head><p>We have modified the hybrid symplectic integrator QYM-SYM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moore &amp; Quillen 2011</ref>) to record properties of all particles that approach within a Hill radius of a planet.</p><p>The integrator runs at two levels, an outer level where all particles are integrated with a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep, τ . When a particle, or particles pass within a planet's Hill radius the encounter is integrated more carefully with an adaptive stepsize N-body integrator. Here we use the word encounter to denote a trajectory that passes within the Hill radius of a planet, not a collision with a planet. For every particle that passes within a planet's Hill radius in each larger timestep, τ , we use the adaptive stepsize finer integration to record the minimum distance to the planet, and at that location we record the relative energy per unit mass</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ep = (v − v p ) 2 2 − GMp |r − r p | ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v, vp are the velocities of particle and planet, r, rp are the positions of particle and planet, respectively, and Mp is the mass of the planet. For Ep &gt; 0 we compute a velocity</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V∞ ≡ 2Ep (2)</formula><p>corresponding to the velocity of the particle distant from the planet and with respect to the planet, were the particle and planet isolated and not orbiting the central star. This velocity can be used to estimate the probability that an exchange reaction with a binary planetesimal can occur leaving behind a bound satellite (e.g, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vokrouhlicky et al. 2008</ref>) though a more accurate calculation uses the Jacobi constant ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Philpott et al. 2010</ref>) or directly integrates orbits of all four bodies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nogueira et al. 2011</ref>). Here we do not integrate the four body problem for a planetesimal binary moving in the gravitational field of a planet in orbit about a star. However we do integrate the trajectories of single planetesimals in the gravitational field a planet in orbit about a star and using these trajectories we estimate the probability that a binary would disrupt near the planet. We work in units of the mass of the central star M * , with distance given in units of the initial semi-major axis of the innermost planet, a1, and time in units of the initial orbital period of the innermost planet. The masses of the planets are M1, M2 and semi-major axes a1, a2. The initial semi-major axes of the planets are a1 = 1 and a2 = 1.4. The initial planet inclinations and eccentricities were set to zero. The initial mean anomaly of the two planets were randomly chosen.</p><p>The planetesimal disk properties are identical for all integrations. The initial planetesimal disk is comprised of N = 8192 objects of mass m = 10 −7 that are distributed between semi-major axes of amin = 1.6 and amax = 2.5. The distribution of planetesimal semi-major axes is flat with probability independent of a within amin and amax. The initial eccentricity and inclination distributions were chosen using Rayleigh distributions with the mean eccentricity ¯ e equivalent to twice the mean value of the inclination ¯ i and ¯ i = 0.01. The initial orbital angles (mean anomalies, longitudes of pericenter and longitudes of the ascending node) were randomly chosen. The total mass of the disk is nearly 10 −3 and large enough that the outer planet can migrate a substantial distance through the disk in a few thousand orbits making it feasible to run a number of similar integrations.</p><p>Our integrations primarily have inner planet with M1 = 10 −3 or M1 = 10 −4 , however a few were done with intermediate or larger masses. The properties of the numerical integrations are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Each simulation was integrated for at least P = 1900 orbits with orbital periods are measured in units of the inner planet's initial orbital period. The outer planet migrated outwards in all simulations, however, in some simulations (those with low mass outer planets) the outer planet first migrated outwards and then reversed direction. As a consequence we consider the statistics of encounters only during the portion of the integration when the outer planet migrated outwards. The length of time used to measure properties of encounters is also reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> in orbital periods of the innermost planet. Final positions of the planets a 1,f and a 2,f and the total number of orbit crossing planetesimals, Nc, are also listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The change in total energy due to numerical integration errors at the end of the integrations was |∆E/E0| 10 −4 where E0 is the initial energy (see Moore &amp; Quillen 2011 for a discussion about the accuracy of this integrator). The simulations were run using NVIDIA graphics cards from the GT200 architecture (the Quadro FX5800, or the GTX 285) or using Fermi Class Tesla C2050 cards from the GF100 architecture. All of these are capable of computing in double precision.</p><p>Planetesimals originating in the outer disk are first scattered by the outer planet. Afterwards they can cross the orbits of both planets. The interaction between planetesimals and planets allows the outer planet to migrate outwards into the planetesimal disk via the exchange of angular momentum between planets and planetesimals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fernandez &amp; Ip 1984)</ref>. While planetesimals are scattered by planets they can have pericenter near that of a planet's semi-major axis. On a plot of semi-major axis versus eccentricity these can be seen as scattering surfaces associated with each planet, as seen in previous integrations of planet migration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kirsh et al. 2009</ref>). To illustrate this, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the semi-major axis and eccentricity distribution at the end of the integration with M1 = 10 −3 and M2 = 10 −4 . At this time approximately half of the planetesimals have experienced encounters with a planet. The other integrations look similar but with different fractions of particles in each scattering surface and differing numbers of particles in between the planets in orbits that cross the orbits of the two planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Trajectories of planet crossing particles</head><p>Because we have logged all particle/planet encounters during the integrations we can examine trajectories of individual particles. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> we show an example of the trajectory of a disk particle from the simulation with M1 = 10 −3 and M2 = 3 × 10 −4 that was ejected near the end of the simulation. We identify ejected particles based on their energies (computed with respect to the central star); those with positive energy have been ejected from the system. In this figure we show the particle's semi-major axis, a, pericenter, q, and apocenter, Q, as a function of time. We also show simultaneously distance between particle and each planet and the velocity V∞ computed with equation (2) as described above. Encounters are only logged when a particle passes within a Hill radius of a planet so V∞ and r are only plotted during encounters.</p><p>When the particle first crosses the orbit of the outer planet it is in a low eccentricity orbit. The velocity of the particle with respect to the planet is not large and so encounters can be gravitationally focused. We see in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> that a slow and close approach to the outer planet happens before close approaches to the inner planet. The eccentricity of the particle must increase before its orbit can cross those of both planets. The velocity difference between particle and planet is larger when there is a large difference between particle and planet semi-major axis and eccentricity. The inner planet is larger than the outer one in this integration and so the inner planet exchanges more energy with the particle. The trajectory shows a series of distant approaches to the inner planet that slowly increase the energy of the particle. Ejection is not due to a single close encounter with the inner planet. If this particle were a binary planetesimal then it would likely disrupt during one of the slow and close approaches with the outer planet just after it becomes orbit crossing rather than later on when its semi-major axis is high and the relative velocity between planets and particle higher. The trajectory shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> also illustrates that the order of close encounters with the planets is important. A fast but close encounter could disrupt a binary without allowing a capture to take place, hence both the order of encounters and the velocities of disrupting encounters must be taken into account to predict the probability of satellite capture. In the next subsection we compute histograms of disruption locations and velocities during disruption for each planet.</p></div>

The semi-major axes of the planets after P orbital periods are listed as a 1,f , a 2,f (columns 4,5). The total number of unique planet orbit crossing planetesimals identified is listed in column 6. Column 7 shows the log of the probability that the inner planet would capture the secondary of a planetesimal binary due to a binary exchange reaction for a binary that disrupts at a normalized tidal disruption radius R td = 0.1 (as discussed in section 3). This probability is given for planetesimal binary with a primary of radius s 1 = 100 km but can be scaled to other planetesimal binaries using factors given in equation 29. The normalized disruption radius, R td is defined in equation 4. Column 8 lists the log of a similar probability but for the outer planet. The probabilities of capture have been estimated from the encounter distributions in the simulations and using equation <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">r td ∼ aB 3Mp m1 + m2 1/3<label>(3)</label></formula><p>(e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006</ref>). A planetesimal binary that becomes planet orbit crossing will be disrupted the first time it comes within a tidal disruption radius of a planet. Previous studies have measured distributions of closest approaches in different contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Levison &amp; Duncan 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Vokrouhlicky et al. 2008</ref>) but have not measured the distribution of disruption radii that depend on both planet mass and the order of close approaches for the idealized migrating system studied here. A binary disrupts if it passes within its tidal disruption radius of a planet (equation 3). The ratio, r td /M 1/3 p , only depends on binary properties (its separation and total mass). For each encounter that approaches within a radius r td of a planet with mass Mp we compute the normalized disruption distance</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">R td = r td a1,init M * Mp 1/3 (4)</formula><p>where a1,init is the initial semi-major axis of the inner planet. A binary that disrupts at R td has</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">R td = a B a 1,init 3M * m 1 +m 2</formula><p>1/3 only dependent on binary properties. This is why we will measure encounter distances in units of R td .</p><p>We now consider the range of possible values for R td . The planet's Hill radius is</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">rHp ≡ ap Mp 3M * 1/3 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>The normalized disruption distance, R td , differs from r td /rHp by a ratio of planet semi-major axes. However since we expect the ratio of planet semi-major axes is of order unity the maximum value of R td is approximately 1. The minimum value of R td occurs when a binary has separation, aB, approximately equivalent to the radius of its more massive body. This gives a limit</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R td 10 −3 ρ 1 g cm −3 − 1 3 M * M⊙ 1 3 a1,init 10 AU −1 (6)</formula><p>where ρ is the density of the planetesimals. The range of allowed values for R td sets the range covered by the x-axes of our subsequent figures. For each planet, we count the number of particles that pass within a given disruption radius. At each disruption distance each orbit crossing particle is only counted once. A particle is counted at a disruption distance for the planet that it first approaches within this distance. The result is two histograms (one for each planet) that are functions of R td and that can be used to predict the disruption radius c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000-000 inner planet outer planet <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Evolution of a planetary orbit crossing particle. Bottom: We show the log of the semi-major axis (purple crosses), pericenter (light blue stars) and apocenter (dark blue plus signs) as a function of time for a particle that was eventually ejected in the integration with planet masses M 1 = 10 −3 and M 2 = 3 × 10 −4 . Changes in particle semi-major axes and eccentricity are caused by close encounters with planets. Middle: The velocity with respect to each planet during close encounters. Green points show velocities for encounters with the outer planet and red points show those for the inner planet. We note that early encounters with the outermost planet tend to have the lowest relative velocities. Top: the distance between the object and planet divided by the planet mass to the third power during close encounters. Green points show distances to the outer planet and red points show those to the inner planet. The closest approach at t ∼ 200 occurs early in the simulation and with the outer planet. This approach also is slow and so could allow the secondary of a binary planetesimal to be captured into orbit about the outer planet during binary disruption. The order of the encounters can be important as an early fast close encounter can disrupt a binary making subsequent irregular satellite capture impossible even if the individual planetesimals later on experience slower encounters.</p><p>for binaries of a given mass and separation and to predict the planet that is responsible for the disruption. The resulting histograms for simulations with M1 = 10 −3 and M2 = {0.5, 1, 3, and 10} × 10 −4 are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. In these simulations about half of the simulated planetesimals have passed within the Hill radius of a planet. The histograms are normalized by the number of planet orbit crossing particles, Nc, with this quantity listed for each simulation in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table (1)</ref>. Because each particle is only counted one (at each disruption radius) we can determine which planet causes the disruption for each type of binary. Wide and low mass binaries are disrupted at large disruption radii whereas tight and massive binaries disrupted at smaller disruption radii. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> we see that wide binaries are most likely to tidally disrupt near the outer planet. For simulations with similar planet masses, tightly bound binaries are more likely   <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The fraction of orbit crossing particles (y-axis) that pass within a disruption distance of R td (x-axis) as defined by equation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> of each planet for four simulations each containing two planets. The properties of the binary (mass and separation) determine the radius at which it would disrupt or R td . Four simulations are shown here and all have inner planet with mass M 1 = 10 −3 . The outer planet mass is M 2 = 0.5, 1, 3 or 10 × 10 −4 depending upon the simulation. The top four and thin curves show fractions of particles that approach the outer planets in simulations (from top to bottom) for simulations with M 2 = 0.5, 1, 3 and 10×10 −4 . The bottom four and thicker curves show fractions for the inner planet for the same simulations. Simulations are labelled by the mass of the outer planet. At each tidal disruption distance, each particle is only counted once and for the planet at which it first approaches within the disruption distance. Weakly bound binaries are preferentially disrupted by the outer planet (high curves on the right hand side of the plot). The difference between the fraction disrupted by the outer planet and disrupted by the inner planet increases as a function of the ratio of inner to outer planet mass.</p><p>to be disrupted by the inner planet. More binaries are disrupted at each disruption radius when the planets are more massive. The difference between the fraction disrupted by the outer planet and that disrupted by the inner planet is largest when the planet mass ratio is large. We expect that an outer planet would have a much richer irregular satellite population than an inner but more massive planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Velocity Distributions</head><p>During tidal disruption the probability that the secondary of the planetesimal binary is left bound to the planet depends on the incoming velocity of the binary <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnor &amp; Hamilton 2006</ref>). The secondary is more likely to be captured into orbit if the incoming velocity is low. For 5 different disruption radii we plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> velocity distributions of the disrupting encounters for each of the two planets for the simulation with M1 = 10 −3 and M2 = 10 −4 (which is also displayed as one of the pairs of curves in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The histograms give the fraction of particles with each V∞ value (with V∞ computed using equation 2). These plots have been normalized so that at each disruption radius the sum of the integrated velocity distributions for the two planets is 1. The curves have been smoothed and particles with computed negative Ep neglected from the histograms. During encoun- ters some particles have computed negative Ep and appear to be bound when they are not because the motion of the planet with respect to the central star has been neglected in the computation of Ep. We see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> that the velocity distributions differ for each planet with the mean of the distributions significantly higher for the inner planet than the outer planet. Low velocity encounters are much more likely with the outer planet than the inner planet. Tight binaries can be disrupted by the inner planet but have sufficiently high velocities that the capture of the secondary into orbit around the planet is unlikely. The curves associated with the outer planet are higher at zero velocity than those for the inner planet implying that orbit crossing planetesimal binaries are more likely to leave a bound object around the outer planet even if they are more likely to be disrupted by the inner planet. In the next section we estimate the probability of irregular satellite capture based on the low velocity region of these distributions for our different numerical integrations.</p><p>As seen from <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for most of our integrations the outer planet migrates a substantial way through the planetesimal disk. By dividing integrations into different time intervals and comparing the distributions based on encounters in these intervals we have checked that the distributions based on the encounters (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3, 4</ref> and subsequent figures) are not strongly dependent upon time. At the beginning of the integrations the outer planet is near the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. We have found that as long as this edge is sufficiently close to the outer planet to allow migration to take place during the integration, the encounter distributions are insensitive to the disk edge location. We attempted to determine if the distributions were sensitive to disk mass by increasing or decreasing the mass of the planetesimals. However we cannot significantly increase the number of disk particles without increasing the length of computation time. If we significantly decrease the disk or planet masses then planet migration can be extremely slow. Each simulation took a few days to run, consequently we were effectively limited to a narrow region of parameter space in both planet and disk masses. We compromised by fixing the disk mass and then choosing only simulations in which the outer planet migrated a significant distance through the disk.</p></div>

A binary cannot have a separation larger than its own Hill radius. The above equation implies that the disruption location in units of a planet's Hill radius primarily depends on the binary separation in units of its own Hill radius. As mentioned in section 2.3, R td differs from r td /rHp by a factor of planet radii. Thus the normalized disruption radius R td given as the x-axis in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> is approximately the ratio of the binary's Hill radius to that of the planet. Transneptunian binaries tend to have separations of order aB/rHB ∼ 0.01 (range 0.002-0.03) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Grundy et al. 2011</ref>) and so would disrupt at radius (from the planet) of about 0.01 a giant planet's Hill radius or with R td of order 0.01.

A planetesimal binary could be tidally disrupted but both objects will remain unbound unless the disruption event removes sufficient energy that one of the objects becomes bound to the planet. We now consider the probability that the secondary (from the binary) is captured as a function of the binary's incoming velocity, V∞, with respect to the planet. We will derive a limit on V∞ that allows a capture to take place. Using this limit we will use our simulations (in which we measure V∞ for close approaches) to estimate the probability that the secondary of a binary planetesimal can be captured into planetary orbit.

Since V∞/vB must be small then A f ∝ vB/V∞ must be large (see equation 18) implying that the encounter must be nearly parabolic for capture to take place. This means we can use equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(23)</ref> and ignore equation <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>.

We show in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> the probability of capture of the secondary by each planet, for a primary planetesimal radius s1 = 100 km and low binary mass ratio, q b , and for the same simulations shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> and 5.

However, the contrast between the capture probability for the outer and inner planet is higher when the planet mass ratio is larger. When the ratio of the planet masses M2/M1 is low, the capture probability for weakly bound binaries (large R td ) is higher than for M2/M1 ∼ 1. This is counter-intuitive as it suggests that additional weakly bound binaries are captured by the inner planet when the outer planet is more massive. The probability of capture by the outer planet is remarkably insensitive to the ratio of the planet masses. However it would be nontrivial to predict the shape of these probability curves and how they depend on planet masses and ratios. Our estimated capture probability ∼ 1% is consistent with that estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nogueira et al. (2011)</ref> for the capture of Triton via binary exchange reactions during Neptune's slow migration outwards following close encounters by the giant planets within the context of the "Nice" model. But as shown here only the outermost planet would tend to capture satellites during this slow period of migration, so other scenarios are required to account for the similarity of the irregular satellite populations of the giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Jewitt &amp; Haghighipour 2007)</ref> and so the majority of irregular satellites in our Solar system.</p><p>If dust associated with a satellite population is detected in the vicinity of an outer exoplanet but there is no inner planet detected, then it would be helpful if the ratio of satellite capture probabilies could be used to place limits on the planet masses.

However, the ratio of capture probabilities appears to be fairly insensitive to the inner planet mass. We note that the two planet masses were necessarily constrained to be in a narrow range because of numerical limitations (we did not want to integrate more than a few thousand orbits). More diverse and challenging simulations would be needed to determine if constraints on planet masses could be based on captured satellite populations. For the range covered by our simulations the ratio is about two orders of magnitude suggesting that outer planets would preferentially be detected from dust associated with an irregular satellite population.</p></div>

A collisional cascade could be maintained if even a small fraction of orbit crossing planetesimals are captured into an irregular satellite population as the outer planet migrates outwards. If the collision rate and opacity becomes high then small objects could be re-accreted onto larger ones. At a sufficiently high opacity a dense and thin ring system could form. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref> there is only a small range of parameter space for possible irregular satellite clouds that could account for the optical emission in the vicinity of Fomalhaut b. Here we find that this constraint might relaxed if the cloud is replenished by incoming captured satellites. These would have to be fairly massive (and so rare) to be captured, however their lifetime depends not only the timescale that they collide with other object bound objects but also with the time it takes them to collide with the population of orbit crossing planetesimals (including planetesimals that are not binaries). As the planet migrates outwards the irregular satellite population would build up until there is a balance between mass acquired by the system (in the form of captured objects that are then fragmented by collisions with either each other or external objects) and mass lost that is either removed from the system by radiation forces, or accreted back onto other objects. If the opacity is sufficiently high then debris could coalesce into a ring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY</head><p>Using numerical integrations of planets interacting with a planetesimal belt we have explored the statistics of close encounters of planetesimals with planets during planetary migration. We have focused exclusively on the problem of a two planet system in proximity to a cold (in terms of velocity dispersion) planetesimal belt exterior to both planets that induces planetary migration. If the planetesimal belt contains binary planetesimals then close encounters with planets can disrupt these binaries. To predict the location of tidal disruption (at what radius and which planet), we have taken into account the order of close encounters with planets. We find that the velocity distribution (for velocities with respect to the planet) of tidally disrupting encounters differs for the two planets. Lower velocity encounters are only likely with the outer planet. As a consequence we predict that the probability that irregular satellites are captured due to binary exchange reactions is higher, by about two orders of magnitude, with an outer planet than an inner one. We estimate that planetesimal binaries similar to those in the Kuiper belt would have a probability of about 1/100 of disrupting and leaving a bound object about an outer migrating planet. Our numerical estimate is consistent with that recently estimated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nogueira et al. (2011)</ref> for the capture of Triton into orbit about Neptune. In migrating systems we infer that only the outer planet could gain a significant population of captured irregular satellites and other scenarios would be needed to account for irregular satellite populations around inner giant planets. We note that the simulations considered here were restricted by numerical considerations to a narrow range of planet and disk masses, only considered cold and exterior planetesimal disks, only considered two giant planet systems and situations lacking planetary encounters. Future studies can expand the types of systems numerically integrated to predict the probability of satellite capture for more diverse systems.</p><p>We estimate that the tidal disruption radius in units of the planet's Hill radius is approximately set by the binary separation in units of its own Hill radius. Thus if optical emission from exoplanets is associated with a dust cloud generated by irregular satellites, as explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref>, then there is a relation between the size of the dust cloud, the planet mass and the properties of the primordial binary planetesimal population. We estimate that capture is allowed only if the incoming binary velocity, with respect to the planet is only a few times the velocity of the binary orbit prior to disruption. We have used this estimate and our numerically measured encounter distributions to estimate the probability that the secondary of a binary planetesimal could be captured into orbit about a planet. To improve upon our derived capture probabilities it is likely that the four body problem (binary planetesimal encounter with a planet in orbit about a star) must be integrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kennedy &amp; Wyatt (2011)</ref> suggested that irregular satellites can be captured if Fomalhaut b crosses into the planetesimal belt. Here we explore a related scenario. We consider Fomalhaut b not crossing into the planetesimal belt, but migrating outwards and capturing planetesimals due to binary exchange reactions with binaries that have been perturbed into planet orbit crossing trajectories. A crude estimate of the mass in irregular satellites captured per unit time suggests that the mass captured per unit time could be larger than the estimated dust production rate if a collisional cascade operates among the irregular satellite population. Consequently there could be sufficient mass captured as irregular satellites to fuel such a collisional cascade. In a migration scenario, we find that the outer planet is likely to gain two orders of magnitude more irregular satellites than inner planets. It is tempting to consider this scenario as accounting for the detection of Fomalhaut b but not other, possibly more massive planets that could exist interior to it in the system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kenworthy et al. 2009</ref>). Further study is needed to determine whether a migration scenario for Fomalhaut b that included irregular satellite capture would be</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Velocity histograms for the simulation with planets M 1 = 10 −3 and M 2 = 10 −4 that is also displayed in Figure 3. For 5 different disruption radii (R td ) we plot the distributions of incoming velocities, V∞, for disrupting close encounters for each planet. The disruption radii are labelled in the key on the upper right. Thick lines correspond to the velocity distributions for the inner planet and thin lines for those of the outer planet. Velocities are in units of the inner planet's initial circular velocity. The top dotted curve is that for the inner planet and R td = 0.3 and the bottom solid curve is that for the outer planet and R td = 0.3. Encounters with the outer planet are more likely to have lower encounter velocities than the inner planet, consequently the outer planet is more likely to capture a secondary during tidal disruption of a planetesimal binary.</figDesc></figure>
