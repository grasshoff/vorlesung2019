			<abstract>
				<p>We present Kepler observations of the bright (V=8.3), oscillating star HD 179070. The observations show transit-like events which reveal that the star is orbited every 2.8 days by a small, 1.6 R Earth object. Seismic studies of HD 179070 using short cadence Kepler observations show that HD 179070 has a frequency-power spectrum consistent with solar-like oscillations that are acoustic p-modes. Asteroseismic analysis provides robust values for the mass and radius of HD 179070, 1.34±0.06 M and 1.86±0.04 R respectively, as well as yielding an age of 2.84±0.34 Gyr for this F5 subgiant. Together with ground-based follow-up observations , analysis of the Kepler light curves and image data, and blend scenario models, we conservatively show at the &gt;99.7% confidence level (3σ) that the transit event is caused by a 1.64±0.04 R Earth exoplanet in a 2.785755±0.000032 day orbit. The exoplanet is only 0.04 AU away from the star and our spectroscopic observations provide an upper limit to its mass of ∼10 M Earth (2-σ). HD 179070 is the brightest exoplanet host star yet discovered by Kepler.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The NASA Kepler mission, described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. (2010a)</ref>, surveys a large area of the sky spanning the boundary of the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. The prime mission goal is to detect transits by exoplanets as their orbits allow them to pass in front of their parent star as viewed from the Earth. Exoplanets, both large and small and orbiting bright and faint stars, have already been detected by the Kepler mission (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borucki et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Koch et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Latham et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dunham et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jenkins et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Holman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Torres et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Howell et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>) and many more exoplanet candidates are known ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>We report herein on one of the brightest targets in the Kepler field, HD 179070 <ref type="bibr">(KIC 3632418, KOI 975</ref>). This V=8.3 F6IV star has been observed prior to the Kepler mission as a matter of course for essentially all of the Henry Draper catalogue stars. Catalogue information 2 for HD179070 provides a T eff of 6137K (spectral type F6 IV), an Hipparcos distance of 108±10 pc, [Fe/H]=-0.15, an age of 2.8 GYr, a radial velocity of -28 km/sec and E(b-y)=0.011 mag. The age, metallicity, and color excess reported in the catalogue come from the photometric study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Nordström, et al. (2004)</ref>. nothing special to distinguish it from any other stars in the HD catalogue. HD 179070 is strongly saturated in the Kepler observations. Techniques to obtain good photometry from saturated stars are employed by the Kepler project and have been used to analyze light curves of other Kepler saturated stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Welsh et al. 2011</ref>) While a star will saturate the CCD detectors on Kepler if brighter than V∼R∼11.5, collecting all the pixels which contain the starlight, including the bleed trail, allow a photometric study to be performed (see <ref type="bibr">Gilliland et al. 2010a</ref>). Kepler light curves of HD179070 from the early data as well as subsequent quarters of observation have shown a repeatable transit-like event in the light curve. We will examine the nature of this periodic signal using Quarter 0 to Quarter 5 Kepler observations and will show that it is caused by a small exoplanet transiting HD 179070 with a period near 2.8 days. We will refer to the host star as HD179070 and the exoplanet as Kepler-21b throughout this paper.</p><p>Our analysis for this exoplanet follows the very complete, tortuous validation path fully described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. (2010)</ref>. The interested reader is referred to that paper for the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, and the WIYN Observatory which is a joint facility of NOAO, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, and Yale University. detailed procedures which we do not completely repeat herein. Section 2 will discuss the Kepler observations including both the light curves and the pixel image data. §3 &amp; §4 discuss ground-based speckle and spectroscopic follow-up observations we have obtained and Section 5 presents the asteroseismic results. Using a full analysis of the observations, we produce a transit model fit for the exoplanet, determine many observational properties for it, and end with a discussion of our results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Kepler Photometry</head><p>The Kepler mission and its photometric performance since launch are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Borucki et al. (2010a)</ref> while the CCD imager on-board Kepler is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Koch et al. (2010b)</ref>  The top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1</ref> shows the raw Kepler light curve of HD 179070 where the larger, low frequency modulations do not likely represent real changes in the star. Thermal jumps in the focal plane temperature near day 100, 120, and 370 are apparent (see Van Cleve 2009) due to safeing events in Q2 and Q5. Normalized and phase-folded light curves are produced and the transit event in the phased light curve is modeled in an effort to understand the transiting object. The middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1</ref> shows a blow up (as highlighted in yellow) of a section of the raw light curve and represents a typical normalized result. The dotted lines mark the individual transit events and the entire Kepler light curve shown here contains 164 individual transits. Taking random quarters of the total light curve and binning them on the transit period provide consistent results as shown in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 1</ref> albeit of lower S/N. The bottom panel <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig. 1)</ref> shows the entire phase folded light curve after detrending and binning all available data. Each bin has a width of 30 minutes and the red curve shows our transit model fit to the data. Points marked with 'o's show where the exoplanet occultation would occur for a circular orbit (i.e., light curve phased at 0.5) or where evidence of a secondary eclipse would be seen if the event arises from a blended, false-positive eclipsing binary.</p><p>Due to the sparse (30-minute) sampling of the image data over the 3.4 hour long transit as well as the low S/N of any individual transit event, a search for transit timing variations produced no detectable periodic signal with an amplitude of 8 mins or greater and no significant deviations at all for any period. False positive identification for unsaturated Kepler targets proceeds by forming an average difference image per quarter by subtracting an average of the in-transit pixel values from average nearby out-of-transit pixel values. The resulting difference image is used to compute a high-accuracy centroid of that difference image ( <ref type="bibr">Torres et al. 2010</ref>). For unsaturated targets the difference image provides a star-like image at the actual location of the transiting object. The high-accuracy centroid is computed by performing a fit of the difference image to the Kepler pixel response function (PRF; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryson et al. 2010</ref>). When the difference images are well behaved, the centroid can have precisions on the order the PSF scale divided by the photometric signal to noise ratio of the transit signal. For Kepler-21b the SNR per quarter of about 25 would support centroiding precisions for sources near the primary of about 0.06 pixels. Having lost spatial resolution due to saturation the centroiding capability will be degraded compared to this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Kepler Images and False Positive Analysis</head><p>The high degree of saturation of HD 179070 prevents the direct application of the above centroiding technique, but we believe that a PRF fitted centroid to the non-saturated pixels in HD 179070's wings provide useful, albeit less accurate, results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 3</ref> shows the average difference image for Quarter 5, which is typical of other quarters. The pixel values which change during a transit are at the ends of the saturated columns as the amount of saturation that spills out of these ends decreases during transit. We also detect the (in phase) transit signal in the stellar wings around the core to the right of the saturated columns. Some saturated pixels become brighter on average during the transits which we ascribe to negative difference values in the pixel-level systematics linked to the non-linear behavior of saturated pixels and to large outliers caused by image motion events. Such negative difference image pixel values are commonly associated with saturated Kepler targets in which we observe shallow transits.</p><p>We can enhance our view of the stellar wings around the saturated core of HD 179070 by setting pixels in columns that have saturated pixels in the direct image to zero in the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 4</ref>. The right panel shows the modeled difference pixel image created by simulating the transit on HD 179070 using the PRF model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryson et al. (2010)</ref> and the measured transit depth, similarly setting the saturated columns to zero. We see that for the stellar wings on the right side there is a reasonable qualitative match between the modeled difference image and the observed pixel values. However, on the left side, the observed wings have slightly negative values. Since we can not know the exact center of the stellar image due to the many saturated pixels, we expect that the PRF-fitted centroid will have some x,y bias. These negative values appear for all quarters, but their locations around the core vary significantly from quarter to quarter, indicating that the PRF-fitting bias varies from quarter to quarter.</p><p>The PRF fit is performed via Levenberg-Marquardt minimization of the χ 2 difference between the modeled and observed difference values, using non-saturated pixels in the model image whose value exceeds 10 −4 of the summed model pixel values. This fit is done on both the difference and direct image, allowing us to compare the centroid of the difference image with the measured centroid of HD 179070 using the same pixels. The resulting in-transit pixel offsets are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, with their formal uncertainties, for quarters 1, 3, 4 and 5 (no quarter 2 data are available). These uncertainties do not include the expected but unknown fit bias due to the negative values in the observed difference image. In quarter 1 we see centroid offsets exceeding a pixel, but this is almost certainly due to significant imagemotion related to pixel-level systematics that were eliminated in later quarters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jenkins et al. 2010c</ref>). In the remaining quarters the offsets are smaller, particularly in quarters 4 and 5 where the offsets are less than a pixel, and there is no consistency, as expected, in the offsets.</p><p>To gain confidence in PRF fitting using pixels in the stellar wings and in using the Kepler image data for HD 179070 as a way to set limits on possible background sources which could make this a false positive, a series of modeled centroids was produced. The source of the false positive event was modeled to be caused by a very dim variable test star (e.g., a background eclipsing binary) with a Kepler magnitude of 18 in which a variation (eclipse) was added with a depth of 50%. Models were produced with the faint test star placed at various pixel positions near the expected center of HD 179070 but such that some of the test stars' light would spill into the unsaturated wings. While the models did not exactly reproduce the observed data due to unknown systematics, the location of the saturated columns was faithfully reproduced when the transit was assumed to be on HD 179070. When the transit was placed on a background star offset by more than half a pixel in column the saturated column clearly became inconsistent with the data. When the transiting object is offset by a pixel or more in the row direction the location of the wings in the model data became similarly inconsistent with the observed data. In this way the models show that the observed difference image can clearly rule out the possibility that the transiting object is located more than a pixel (4 arcsec) from HD 179070. Row offsets displace the model stellar wings in a difference image by large fractions of a pixel relative to the observed difference images. The effect of a column offset is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 5</ref>, where we see that a column offset of one pixel (or more) causes the transit signal in the difference image to disappear from one or more of the saturated columns again not consistent with the Kepler observations. Based on our PRF model results, we are confident that the source of the transiting object is ≤1 pixel of the x,y position of HD 179070.</p></div>

At the distance of HD 179070 (d∼108 pc), this annulus corresponds to distances of 5.4 to 194 AU from the star. We note that any stellar companions or massive exoplanets (∼20 Earth masses or more) inside 5.4 AU would be easily detectable in the radial velocity signature (see §4). We note that while reaching to 5 magnitudes fainter than the target star eliminates bright companions and some fraction of low-mass faint associated companions, it does not completely rule out the probable larger population of faint background EBs (see §7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">MMT AO Imaging</head><p>AO images of HD 179070 were obtained on 2010 September 23 UT using the ARIES instrument on the 6.5-m MMT. ARIES is a near-infrared diffraction-limited imager, and was operated in the F/30 mode (0.02" per pixel) in both the J and Ks filters. The combined Ks image was created by combining 18 images: one 1-s and 17 0.9-s exposures, with two initial pointings at each exposure time and a raster of 4 4-point dithers with a jittered 2" offset between each position. The combined J image was similarly made from 17 0.9-s exposures (one single and sixteen dithered images). The images were shifted, sky-subtracted, and combined using xmosaic in the IRAF package xdimsum. The final AO images are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.</p><p>The seeing was relatively poor, with image FWHM of 0.33" in J and 0.29" in Ks. A faint companion is detectable in the Ks data, and hinted at in the J data. PSF fitting, using an analytical Gaussian model, found a magnitude difference of ∆ − Ks = 3.7 + / − 0.1, while a lower limit was estimated for ∆ − J &gt; 4.0. The separation between the two components was found to be 0.7" +/-0.05", with an approximate position angle of 135 degrees east of north.</p><p>The faint companion was detected right at the limit of the ARIES frame, and at a distant of just over 2 FWHM. At the object's distance, 0.7", the estimated Ks detection limit for additional companions was 4.2 mag fainter (3.6 mag in J), increasing to 5.7 mag in Ks (5.1 in J) at 1", 7.5 mag in Ks (7.2 in J) at 2", and 8 mag in Ks (7.8 in J) beyond 4". In order to get better magnitude limits and a firm J-band detection, additional AO images were acquired using Keck.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Keck AO Imaging</head><p>Near-infrared adaptive optics imaging of HD 179070 was obtained on the night of 22 February 2011 and 23 February 2011 with the Keck-II telescope and the NIRC2 near-infrared camera behind the natural guide star adaptive optics system. NIRC2, a 1024×1024 HgCdTe infrared array, was utilized in 9.9 mas/pixel mode yielding a field of view of ≈ 10 . Observations were performed on first night in the K-prime filter (K ; λ 0 = 2.124µm; δλ = 0.351µm), and on the second night in the J filter (λ 0 = 1.248µm; δλ = 0.163µm). A single K data frame was taken with an integration time of 2 seconds and 10 coadds; 10 frames were acquired for a total integration time of 200 seconds. A single J data frame was taken with an integration of 0.18s and 20 coadds; 10 frames were acquired for a total integration time of 36 seconds. The weather on the night of the observations was poor with occasional heavy clouds.</p><p>The individual frames were background-subtracted and flat-fielded into a single final image for each filter. The central core of the resulting point spread functions had a width of F W HM = 0.07 (≈ 7 pixels) at J and F W HM = 0.09 (≈ 9 pixels) at K . The final coadded images are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. A faint source is detected 0.75 from the primary target at a position angle of P A = 129 • east of north. The source is fainter than the primary target by ∆J = 4.70 ± 0.05 mag and ∆K = 3.95 ± 0.05 mag. No other sources were detected within 5 of the primary target.</p><p>If the faint companion is a dwarf star, the J − Ks color implies that it is a very late M-dwarf (∼M5-M8; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Leggett et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ciardi et al. 2011</ref>) and would be at a distance of approximately 15±8 pc. If the companion is a giant star, the J − Ks color implies that it is an M0 giant and would have an approximate distance of 10 kpc. Appendix A discusses in detail our use of the near-IR AO observation to convert the companion's brightness into K p = 14.4±0.2. The maximum line of sight extinction to the faint companion (as determined from the IRAS/DIRBE dust maps; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Schlegel et al., 1998</ref>) is A V ≈ 0.5 mag, which corresponds to an E(J − Ks) ≈ 0.09 mag; such an excess would only change the implied spectral type by a single subclass (M5 dwarf and K5 giant) and would not appreciably change the derived distances. The red dwarf can be made much earlier in spectral type (and thus located at the same distance of HD 179070) but this would require significant reddening along the exact line of sight to the star which is ruled out based on the color excess listed for HD 179070 in the literature (E(b-y)=0.011). The primary target has a Hipparcos distance of 108 ± 10 pc; thus, the faint companion, whether it is a dwarf or giant, is not physically associated with the primary target.</p><p>Source detection completeness was estimated by randomly inserted fake sources of various magnitudes in steps of 0.5 mag and at varying distances in steps of 1.0 FWHM from the primary target. Identification of sources was performed both automatically with the IDL version of DAOPhot and by eye. Magnitude detection limits were set when a source was not detected by the automated FIND routine or was not detected by eye. Within a distance of 1 − 2 FWHM, the automated finding routine often failed even though the eye could discern two sources, particularly since the observations were taken in poor weather conditions. A summary of the detection efficiency as a function of distance from the primary star is given <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Beyond ≈ 0.7 , the detection limit is ≈ 6 magnitudes fainter than the target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Spectroscopic Observations</head><p>Optical spectroscopy for HD 179070 was obtained by three ground-based telescopes as part of the Kepler mission follow-up program ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batalha et al. 2010</ref>). These observations include early reconnaissance spectra to assess stellar identification, rotation, and to make a first check on binary as well as detailed high precision radial velocity work using Keck HIRES. We compare all of our ground-based spectroscopic determined values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Reconnaissance spectra of HD179070 were obtained on <ref type="bibr">13 &amp; 16 Sept. 2010</ref> UT at the Kitt Peak 4-m telescope using the RCSpec instrument. The 4-m RCSpec setup used a 632 l/mm grating (KPC-22b in second order) with a 1 arcsec slit to provide a mean spectral resolution of 1.6 ˚ A per resolution element across the full wavelength range of 3750-5100Å5100Å. The spectra were reduced in the normal manner with observations of calibration lamps and spectrophotometric stars (obtained before and after each sequence) and bias and flat frames collected each afternoon. Each fully reduced 4-m spectrum (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>) was cross-correlated and χ 2 fit to both the entire MK standard stars digitally available in the "Jacoby Atlas" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jacoby et al. 1984</ref>; covers all spectral and luminosity types) as well as to a suite of stellar models (ranging in T eff from 3500K to 7000K, log g from 1.0 to 5.0, and solar metallicity) available through the Spanish Virtual Observatory 3 .</p><p>Spectral type, luminosity class, and other stellar parameters were provided by the best fit match and both of the 4-m spectra gave consistent results: F4-6 IV star with T eff = 6250±250K, log g = 4.0±0.25, and metal poor ([Fe/H] = -0.15). No relevant vsini information was available from the moderate resolution (R∼5000) 4-m spectra.</p><p>As is common procedure for the Kepler Mission, all exoplanet candidate stars also receive high resolution, low signal to noise (S/N), spectroscopic observations to identify easily recognizable astrophysical false positives. One or two correctly timed spectra can help rule out many types of false positives, including single-and double-lined binaries, certain types of hierarchical triples and even some background eclipsing binaries, all of which show velocity variations and/or composite spectra that are readily detectable by the modest facilities used for these reconnaissance observations. We also use these spectra to estimate the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and rotational and radial velocities of the host star. Below is a brief description of the instrument, the data reduction, and the analysis performed in this step.</p><p>We used the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES; Furesz 2008) on the 1.5m Tillinghast Reflector at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, AZ to obtain a high resolution, low S/N spectrum of HD 179070 (S/N∼7 per resolution element, 360 second exposure) on 28 Sep 2010 UT. The observation was taken with the medium fiber on TRES, which has a resolving power of λ/dλ ∼ 44,000 and a wavelength coverage of 3900-8900 angstroms. The spectrum was extracted and analyzed according to the procedures outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Buchhave et al. (2010)</ref>. Cross-correlations were performed against the grid of CfA synthetic spectra, which are based on Kurucz models calculated by John Laird and rely on a line-list compiled by Jon Morse. The template with the highest correlation coefficient yields an estimate of the stellar parameters: T eff = 6250±125 K, log(g) = 4.0±0.25, and Vrot = 8± 1 km/s. The errors correspond to half of the grid spacing, although they neglect possible systematics, e.g., those introduced in the event the metallicity differs from solar. We find the absolute radial velocity to be V rad = -19.1±0.3 km/s. Finally, HD 179070 was subjected to RV measurements with <ref type="bibr">Keck (Vogt et al. 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">, Marcy et al. 2008</ref>). We note that the Ca-II K-line shows virtually no chromospheric reversal, giving an S value of 0.14, placing HD 179070 among the quietest G stars. We have obtained 14 RV measurements with the Keck telescope and HIRES spectrometer (R=60,000). The exposure time for each spectrum was established by use of an exposure meter such that all would yield a consistent S/N and thus very similar RV precision. The Keck HIRES exposures were 150±30 sec in all cases. Each observation consisted of a triplet of exposures with each exposure having a signal-to-noise of 210 per pixel and an internal RV error of ∼2 m s −1 . We determined the RV from each exposure and took the weighted mean as the final RV for each triplet. The internal error (a typical uncertainty for each exposure) was based on the iodine line fits for each exposure.</p><p>We adopted a jitter of 5 m s −1 , typical for stars of such spectral type and rotational Vsini, adding the jitter in quadrature to the internal errors that were ∼2 m s −1 . Low-gravity F6 stars are well known to exhibit jitter of ∼5-10 m/sec <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Isaacson &amp; Fischer 2010</ref>) due presumably to photospheric velocity fields but the exact origin remains unclear. F-type main sequence stars engage in a quasi-stable δ Scuti-like phenomenon, a feature not seen in the G and K stars. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> gives the times and the velocity measurements and their uncertainties. The jitter was not added to these uncertainties in quadrature, offering the reader a chance to see the uncertainties pre-jitter. The resulting 14 RVs had a standard deviation of 5.6 m s −1 , consistent with the expected total errors. </p></div>

A time series was prepared for asteroseismic analysis in the manner described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">García et al. (2011)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 11</ref> plots the frequency-power spectrum of the prepared time series, which shows a beautiful pattern of peaks due to solar-like oscillations that are acoustic (pressure, or p) modes of high radial order, n. The observed power in the oscillations is modulated in frequency by an envelope that has an approximately Gaussian shape. The frequency of maximum oscillation power, ν max , has been shown to scale to good approximation as gT −1/2 eff <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995)</ref>, where g is the surface gravity and T eff is the effective temperature of the star. The l identification, from visual inspection of the mode pattern in the frequency-power spectrum, is unambiguous and the n identification followed from the best-fitting to stellar evolutionary models (see below). The most obvious spacings in the spectrum are the large frequency separations, ∆ν, between consecutive overtones n of the same spherical angular degree, l. These large separations scale to very good approximation as ρ 1/2 , ρ ∝ M/R 3 being the mean density of the star, with mass M and surface radius R (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Christensen-Dalsgaard 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Here, seven teams estimated the average large separation, ∆ν, and ν max , using automated analysis tools that have been developed, and extensively tested (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Campante et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hekker et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Huber et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Karoff et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mosser &amp; Appourchaux 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mathur et al. 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Roxburgh 2009</ref>) for application to the large ensemble of solar-like oscillators observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Chaplin et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Verner et al. 2011</ref>). A final value of each parameter was selected by taking the individual estimate that lay closest to the average over all teams. The uncertainty on the final value was given by adding (in quadrature) the uncertainty on the chosen estimate and the standard deviation over all teams. We add that there was excellent consistency between results, and no outlier rejection was required. The final values for ∆ν and ν max were 60.86 ± 0.55 µHz and 1153 ± 32 µHz, respectively. We did not use the average frequency separation between the l = 0 and l = 2 modes (often called the small separation) in the subsequent modeling because HD 179070 turns out to be a subgiant (as indicated by, for example, the size of ∆ν), and in this phase of evolution the parameter provides little in the way of additional constraints given the modest precision achievable in it from one month of data (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Metcalfe et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">White et al., 2011</ref>).</p><p>Use of individual frequencies increases the information content provided by the seismic data for making inference on the stellar properties. Six teams provided estimates of individual frequencies, applying "peak bagging" techniques developed for application to <ref type="bibr">CoRoT (Appourchaux et al. 2008</ref>) and Kepler data (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Metcalfe et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Campante et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mathur et al. 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fletcher et al. 2010</ref>).

(2011)</ref> to select from the six sets of estimated frequencies one set that would be used to model the star. This so-called "minimal frequency set" contains estimates on modes for which a majority of the teams' estimates were retained after applying Peirce's criterion (Peirce 1852; Gould 1855) for outlier rejection. Use of one of the individual sets, as opposed to some average over all sets, meant that the modeling could rely on an easily reproducible set of input frequencies. The selected frequencies are listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Estimation of stellar properties</head><p>We adopted two approaches to estimate the fundamental properties of HD 179070. In the first we used a grid-based approach, in which properties were determined by searching among a grid of stellar evolutionary models to get a best fit for the input parameters, which were ∆ν, ν max , and T eff = 6131 ± 44 K, from spectroscopic observations made on the Keck telescope in support of the HD 179070 analysis, and <ref type="bibr">[</ref> In the second approach, the individual frequencies ν nl were analyzed by the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP), a web-based tool tied to TeraGrid computing resources that uses the Aarhus stellar evolution code ASTEC (Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008a) and adiabatic pulsation code ADIPLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Christensen-Dalsgaard 2008b</ref>) in conjunction with a parallel genetic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Metcalfe &amp; Charbonneau 2003)</ref> to optimize the match to observational data (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Metcalfe et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">, Woitaszek et al. 2009</ref> for more details).</p><p>Each model evaluation involves the computation of a stellar evolution track from the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) through a mass-dependent number of internal time steps, terminating prior to the beginning of the red giant stage. Exploiting the fact that ∆ν is a monotonically decreasing function of age (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Metcalfe et al. 2009</ref>, and references therein), we optimize the asteroseismic age along each evolution track using a binary decision tree. The frequencies of the resulting model are then corrected for surface effects following the prescription of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kjeldsen et al. (2008)</ref>. A separate value of χ 2 is calculated for the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints, and these values are averaged for the final quality metric to provide more equal weight to the two types of observables. The optimal model is then subjected to a local analysis employing a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to quantify the values, uncertainties and correlations of the final model parameters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Creevey et al. 2007</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Results on stellar properties</head><p>Both approaches to estimation of the stellar properties yielded consistent results on the mass and radius of the star.

The trends observed on various timescales are a combinination of astrophysical phenomenon and instrumental artifacts. These trends were removed from the lightcurve as our lightcurve model did not account for such effects. The photometric time series was prepared for modeling by independently detrending each quarterly Kepler time-series. A cubic polynomial was fitted and removed and then filtered with a 5-day running median. Any observations that occurred during transit where masked out during the calculation of the polynomial fits or medians. Our model fits for the physical and orbital parameters of the planetary system. The transit shape was described by the analytic formulae of Mandel &amp; Agol 2002. We adopted a non-linear limb-darkening law (Claret). Coefficients were calculated by convolving Atlas-9 spectral models with the Kepler bandpass using the adopted estimate of T eff from <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and the asteroseismic value of log g. Limb darkening coefficients are held fixed for all transit fits. We assumed a Keplerian orbit for the planet with zero eccentricity. Our model fitted for the period (P), epoch (T0), impact parameter (b), the mean stellar density ( ¯ ρ ), the ratio of the planet and star radii (R p /R ), radial velocity amplitude (K) and the radial velocity zero point (γ). A set of best fit model parameters was constructed by fixing ¯ ρ to the best value from asteroseimology. Minimization of Chi-squared was found using a Levenberg-Marquart method allowing P, T0, b, R p /R , K and γ To estimate the error on each fitted parameter a hybrid-MCMC approach was used similar to <ref type="bibr">Ford (2005)</ref>. The asteroseismic value of ¯ ρ and its statical error was adopted as a prior. A Gaussian Gibbs sampler was used to identify new jump values of test parameter chains. The width of the Gaussian sampler was initial determined by the error estimates from the best-fit model. After 500-chains where generated the chain success rate was examined and the Gaussian width was rescaled using Equation 8 Gregory (2011). This process was repeated after the generation of each 500 chains until the success rate for each parameter was between 22 and 28%. At which point the Gaussian width was held fixed.</p><p>To handle the large correlation between the model parameters a hybrid MCMC algorithm was adopted based on Gregory (2011). The routine works by randomly using a Gibbs sampler or a buffer of previously computed chain points to generate proposals to jump to a new location in the parameter space. The addition of the buffer allows for a calculation of vectorized jumps that allow for efficient sampling of highly correlated parameter space. After the widths Gibbs sampler stabilized, 200,000 chains where generated. The process was repeated 3 additional times to test for convergence via a Gelman Rubin test <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gelman &amp; Rubin 1992</ref>).</p><p>The 4 chain sets where combined and used to calculate the median, standard deviation and 1σ bounds of the parameter distribution centered on the median value. Adopting the asteroseismic errors on the stellar mass and radius we computed the planetary radius (R p ), inclination angle (i) and semi-major axis (a) and also the scaled semi-major axis (a/R ) and transit-duration (T dur ) from the model parameter distributions and report all values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  5</ref>.</p></div>

The parameters considered for these blends include the masses (or spectral types) of the two eclipsing objects (or the size of the one producing the eclipses, if a planet), the relative distance between the binary and the target, the impact parameter, and the eccentricity and orientation of the orbit of the binary, which can affect the duration of the events. Our simulations explore broad ranges in each of these parameters, with the eccentricities for planetary orbits limited to the maximum value recorded for known transiting systems with periods as short as that of HD 179070 (we adopted a conservative limit of e &lt; 0.4; see http://exoplanet.eu/), and eccentricities for eclipsing binaries limited to e &lt; 0.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Raghavan et al. 2010</ref>). Scenarios that give significantly worse fits than a true transit model fit (at the 3-σ level) are considered to be rejected. While this rejection reduces the space of parameters for viable blends considerably, it does not eliminate all possible blends. Constraints from follow-up observations described previously (such as high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy) as well as multi-band photometry available for the target allow us to rule out additional areas of parameter space (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 13)</ref>. We then estimate the a priori likelihood of the remaining blends in the manner described in the next section. To obtain a Bayesian estimate of the probability that the transit events are due to a bona-fide planet, we must compare the a priori likelihood of such a planet and of a false positive (odds ratio). We consider the candidate to be statistically "validated" if the likelihood of a planet is several orders of magnitude greater than that of a blend. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For full details on the BLENDER procedure, we refer the reader to the references cited above.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Background blends</head><p>We examined first the case of background eclipsing binaries composed of two stars. Our detailed simulations with BLENDER indicate that false positives of this kind are not able to match the observed shape of the transit well enough (either in depth, duration of ingress/egress, or total duration), or else they feature significant ellipsoidal variations out of transit that are not seen in the Kepler photometry. The best-fitting scenario of this kind gives a match to the observations that is worse than that of a true transiting planet model at the 6σ level, which we consider unacceptable. We also find that blends involving evolved stars (giants or subgiants) orbited by a smaller star are easily ruled out, as well as those with a main-sequence star eclipsed by a white dwarf. In both cases the companion induces strong curvature out of eclipse due to the short orbital period (2.78 days), and for giants the large stellar radius additionally requires a grazing "V"-shaped transit to match the observed duration.</p><p>When the object producing the eclipses is a planet rather than a star, ellipsoidal variations are negligible, and the shape of the eclipses (further attenuated by the light of the target) can more easily match the observed shape for a large range of properties of the stars and planets involved. An illustration of the constraints provided by BLENDER for false positives of this kind is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 14</ref>. Following the BLENDER nomenclature we refer to the target star as the "primary", and to the components of the eclipsing pair as the "secondary" and "tertiary" (in this case a planet). The figure shows the χ 2 landscape (goodness of fit compared to a true transiting planet model) projected onto two of the dimensions of parameter space, corresponding to the mass of the secondary on the horizontal axis and the relative distance between the primary and the binary on the vertical axis. The latter is cast for convenience here in terms of the difference in distance modulus. The colored regions represent contours of equal goodness of fit, with the 3-σ contour indicated in white. Blends inside this contour give acceptable fits to the Kepler photometry, and are considered viable. They involve stars that can be up to 7 magnitudes fainter than the target in the Kepler passband (as indicated by the dashed green line in the figure, corresponding to background stars with ∆Kp = 7), and that are transited by a planet of the right size to produce the measured signal. Also indicated are other constraints that rule out portions of parameter space otherwise allowed by BLENDER. The blue hatched region represents blends that have overall colors for the combined light as predicted by BLENDER that are either too red (left) or too blue (right edge) compared to the measured color of the target (r−K s = 1.314 ± 0.035, adopted from the KIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. 2011</ref>), at the 3-σ level. The green hatched area represents blends that are bright enough (up to 4 mag fainter than the target) to have been detected in our high-resolution spectroscopy as a second set of lines (see Sect. 4). With these observational constraints the pool of false positives of this kind is significantly reduced, but many remain. We describe in Sect. 7.3 how we assess their frequency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Blends involving physically associated stars</head><p>Hierarchical triple configurations in which the eclipsing object (tertiary) is a star are easily ruled out by BLENDER, as these configurations invariably lead to the wrong shape for a transit. However, stars physically associated with the target that are orbited by a planet of the appropriate size can still mimic the light curve well when accounting for dilution from the brighter star HD 179070. The χ 2 map for this type of blend is seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 15</ref>. In this case the color of the blend is not a strong discriminant, as all of these false positives are predicted to have r−K s indices similar to that of the target itself. The expected brightness of the companion stars, though, is such that most would have been detected spectroscopically (∆Kp ≤ 4; green hatched exclusion region), unless their RV compared to the target is small enough that their spectral lines are blended with those of the main star. Based on our spectroscopic observations we estimate conservatively that we would miss such companions if they had radial velocities within ∼15 km s −1 of the RV of the target. These blends are not eliminated by any other observational constraint; we estimate their frequency below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3.">Validation of Kepler-21 b</head><p>With the constraints on false positives afforded by the combination of BLENDER and other follow-up observations, we may estimate the a priori likelihood of a blend following a procedure analogous to that explained by <ref type="bibr">Fressin et al. (2001)</ref>.</p><p>For blends involving background stars transited by a planet, this frequency will depend on the density of background objects near the target, the area around the target within which such stars would go undetected, and the rate of occurrence of planets of the appropriate size transiting those stars. We perform these calculations in half-magnitude bins, with the following ingredients: a) the Galactic structure models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Robin et al. (2003)</ref> to estimate the number density of stars per square degree, subject to the mass limits allowed by BLENDER; b) results from our adaptive optics observations to estimate the maximum angular separation (ρ max ) at which companions would be missed, as a function of magnitude difference relative to the target ( <ref type="bibr">Kp = 8.224)</ref> properly converted to the Kp band, as described in the Appendix; and c) the overall frequency of suitable transiting planets that can mimic the signal. The size range for these planets, as determined in our BLENDER simulations, is 0.38-2.0 R Jup . To estimate the frequency of such planets we make use of the list of 1235 planet candidates released by the Kepler Mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>, based on the first four months of observation by the spacecraft. While these objects have not all yet been confirmed because follow-up is still in progress, the false positive rate is expected to be relatively low (typically less than 10%; see 25) and will not affect our results significantly. We therefore assume that all of them represent true planets, and that the census of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> is complete for objects of this size (see below). The estimated frequency of these planets in the allowed radius range is f planet ≈ 0.19%.</p><p>The results of our calculation for the frequency of blends involving background stars is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. Columns 1 and 2 give the magnitude range for background stars and the magnitude difference compared to the target; column 3 lists the range of allowed masses for the stars, based on our BLENDER simulations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 14)</ref>; columns 4 and 5 list the mean star densities and ρ max , respectively, and column 6 gives the number of background stars we cannot detect, and is the result of multiplying column 4 by the area implied by ρ max . Finally, the product of column 6 and the transiting planet frequency of 0.19% leads to the blend frequencies in column 7. The sum of these frequencies is given at the bottom under "Totals", and is 8.0 × 10 −7 .</p><p>For blends involving physically associated stars with RVs within 15 km s −1 of the target, which would go unnoticed in our spectroscopic observations, we estimate the frequency through a Monte Carlo experiment. We simulate companion stars in randomly chosen orbits around the target, and randomly assign them transiting planets in the appropriate radius range as a function of the secondary mass (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 15</ref>), according to their estimated frequencies from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>. We then determine what fraction of these stars would be missed because of projected angular separations below the 0. 05 detection threshold from our speckle observations, velocity differences relative to the target under 15 km s −1 , or because they would induce a drift in the RV of the target that is undetectable in our Keck observations (i.e., smaller than ±10 m s −1 over a period of 82 days; see Sect. 4). Binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios were drawn randomly from the distributions presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref>, and the mass ratios used in combination with our estimate of the mass of HD 179070 to infer the mass of the physical companions. We adopt an overall binary frequency of 34% from the same source.</p><p>Based on these simulations we obtain a frequency for this type of false positive of 1.17 × 10 −6 . However, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 15</ref>, planets involved in blends with physically associated stars can be considerably smaller (∼0.12-0.18 R Jup ) than those involved in background blends (0.38-2.0 R Jup ), so we must consider the potential incompleteness of the census of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> at the smaller planet sizes. To estimate this we performed Monte Carlo simulations in which we calculated the signal-to-noise ratio for each of the Kepler targets that would be produced by a central transit of a planet with the period of HD 179070 and with a given radius in the allowed range. Adopting the Kepler detection threshold of 7 for the signal-to-noise ratio <ref type="bibr">Jenkins et al. (2010)</ref>, we determined the fraction of stars for which such a planet could have been detected during the four months in which that sample was observed. We have assumed that the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the square root of the transit duration and with the square root of the number of transits, and that the data were taken in a continuous fashion (except for gaps between quarters). In this way we obtained a completeness fraction of about 65%, although this may be slightly optimistic given that some transits could have been missed due to additional interruptions in the data flow for attitude corrections and safe mode events. This brings the frequency of hierarchical triple blends to 1.8 × 10 −6 . The total blend frequency is then the sum of the two contributions (background stars and physically associated stars with transiting planets), which is 8×10 −7 +1.8×10 −6 = 2.6×10 −6 .</p><p>Finally, following the Bayesian approach outlined earlier, we require also an estimate of the likelihood of a true planet around HD 179070 ("planet prior") to assess whether it is sufficiently larger than the likelihood of a blend, in order to validate the candidate. To estimate the planet prior we may appeal once again to the catalog of 1235 candidates from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>, which contains 99 systems with planetary radii within 3σ of the measured value for HD 179070 (R p = 1.64 ± 0.04 R ⊕ ). The 3-σ limit used here is for consistency with a similar criterion adopted above in BLENDER. Given the total number of 156,453 Kepler targets from which the 1235 candidates were drawn, we obtain a planet frequency of 99/156,453 = 6.3 × 10 −4 . Applying the same incompleteness factor described above, which holds also for the radius of this candidate, we arrive at a corrected planet prior of 9.7 × 10 −4 . This conservative figure is ∼370 times larger than the blend frequency, which we consider sufficient to validate the planet around HD 179070 to a high degree of confidence. We note that this odds ratio is a lower limit, as we have been conservative in several of our assumptions. In particular, for computing the frequency of planets transiting background stars <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 6</ref>) we have included objects with sizes anywhere between the minimum and maximum planet radius allowed by BLENDER for stars of all spectral types (0.38-2.0 R Jup ), whereas the planet size range for secondaries of a given mass is considerably smaller. This would reduce the frequency of this type of false positive, strengthening our conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Limits to the Density and Mass for Kepler-21b</head><p>To determine a statistically firm upper limit to the planet mass, we carried out an MCMC analysis of the Keck radial velocities with a Keplerian model for the planet's orbit. The resulting 2-sigma upper limit to the mass yielded the Keplerian model shown in <ref type="bibr">Figures 9 &amp; 10</ref> and gave the following upper limits: RV amplitude of K &lt;3.9 m s −1 ; a planet mass of M = 10.4 M Earth (2σ), and a corresponding density of ρ &lt; 12.9 g cm −3 . This upper limit to the density of 12.9gcm −3 is so high that the planet could be (compressed) solid or composed of admixtures of rocky, water, and gas in various amounts, unconstrained by this large upper limit to density. The 1-sigma upper limit to density is 7.4gcm −3 , still consistent with all types of interior compositions and would yield a planet mass of ∼5.9 M Earth .</p><p>If Kepler-21b contains a large rocky core, the high pressure inside such a massive planet would cause the silicate mantle minerals to compress to dense phases of post-perovskite; the iron core is also at higher density than inside Earth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Valencia et al. 2007</ref>). However, Kepler-21b could also have a small rocky core, be mostly gas and not be nearly as massive.</p><p>The maximum core fraction expected for rocky planets of this radius corresponds to a planet with mass of 10.0 M Earth and a mean density of 12.5 g/cc (see mantle stripping simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Marcus et al. 2010</ref>) with a corresponding RV semi-amplitude of 2.3 m/sec, still below our detection limit. If Kepler-21b is a water planet with low silicate-to-iron ratio and 50% water by mass, its mass would be merely 2.2 M Earth , similar to that of Kepler-11f, but at mean density of 2.7 g/cc. The measured radial velocities provide neither a confirmation nor a robust limit (∼10 Earth-masses) on the mass of Kepler-21b but suggests an upper limit near that of the maximum rocky core fraction theoretically allowed. The radial velocities certainly rule out higher mass companions (additional planets or stellar companions) with orbital periods in the period range of up to approximately 200 days as any RV trend caused by such a companion would be apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs. 9 &amp; 10</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusion</head><p>Kepler photometry of the bright star HD 179070 reveals a small periodic transit-like signal consistent with a 1.6 R Earth exoplanet. The transit signal repeats every 2.8 days and the complete phased light curve shows all of the events to be consistent in phase, amplitude, and duration. Analysis of the Kepler image data and difference images are well matched by model fits. Detailed point response function (PRF) models conclude that the source of the transit event is centered on or near to the center of HD 179070 itself. Furthermore, these models show that many faint background eclipsing binary scenarios, capable of blending light with that from HD 179070 to produce the transit-like event, can be eliminated.</p><p>High resolution ground-based optical speckle imaging reveals no nearby companion star to within 5 magnitudes of HD179070 itself. Near-IR AO observation, however, reveal a faint companion star 0.75" away and ∼4 magnitudes fainter in K. Using a color transformation, this star is expected to be R∼14.2, just below the detection limit of the speckle results. Spectroscopic observations also confirm that no bright star is present near HD 179070 (within 0.5"). Asteroseismology was performed for HD 179070 using the Kepler light curves. Adopting the spectroscopically determined values for T eff , log g, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, the mass, radius, and age of HD 179070 were well determined.</p><p>Putting all of the above observations and models together, we conclude that the cause of the periodic transit event is indeed a small 1.6 R Earth exoplanet orbiting the subgiant star HD 179070. Transit models were fit to the highly precise Kepler light curve data revealing that the exoplanet orbits every 2.78 days at an inclination of 82.5 degrees. The exoplanet has an equilibrium temperature near 1900K and is located 0.04 AU from its host star. <ref type="bibr">Kepler-21b</ref> has been validated by detailed modeling of blend scenarios as a true exoplanet at greater than 99.7% confidence. We can only determine an upper mass limit for the exoplanet, ∼10 M Earth , resulting in a upper limit to the mean density of ∼13 g cm −3 .</p><p>Kepler continues to monitor HD 179070 and will eventually build up higher S/N phased transit light curves. These long term observations may allow other planets within this same system may be directly detected or detected via transit timing variations. Given the brightness of HD 179070, it is likely that continued radial velocity monitoring will take place with Keck or other current or planned radial velocity instruments. Given a consistent level of instrumental precision, the observed stellar jitter will slowly be averaged out and velocity signals from this or other planets orbiting the host star may be detected. Finally, using a technique such as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schuler et al. (2011)</ref> high-resolution, high signal-tonoise echelle spectroscopy will provide detailed metal abundance values of the host star's atmosphere which may hold clues as to the formation, or not, of planetary bodies.</p><p>We thank John Johnson for use of some of his Keck Time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">Appexdix A: Transformation of Infrared Colors</head><p>To understand the contribution of the faint infrared companion to the light curve in the Kepler bandpass, we need to convert the measured infrared color (J − K ) to a Kepler magnitude (Kp). To do this, we have derived a color-color relationship (Kp−Ks vs. J −Ks) utilizing the Kepler targets from Q1 public release and the photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. 2011</ref>). Separating the KIC into dwarfs and giants as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ciardi et al. (2011)</ref>, we have fitted the color-color relationship with a 5th-order polynomial for the dwarfs and a 3rd-order polynomial for the giants (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figures 16 and 17)</ref>.  The real apparent photometry of the infrared companion was determined from the 2MASS photometry of the primary target (J = 7.229 ± 0.032 mag, Ks = 6.945 ± 0.018 mag) which is a blend of the two sources. The above color-color relationships were determined using the Ks filter, but the observations were taken in the K filter which has a slightly shorter central wavelength (2.148 µm vs. 2.124 µm). Typically, the Ks and K filters yield magnitudes which are within 0.02 − 0.03 magnitudes of each other and have zero-point flux densities within 2% (AB magnitudes = 1.86 and 1.84 for <ref type="bibr">Ks and K , respectively;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tokunaga &amp; Vacca 2005)</ref>. Given the quality of the weather and resulting photometry, the width of the color-color relationships, and lack of an H-band observation to aid in the transformation of the K observations, we have equated K to Ks in these calculations and propagated an additional uncertainty of 0. It is not unexpected that the measured median colors would be dependent upon the real apparent infrared magnitude; as the photometry becomes more sensitive to fainter and fainter sources, more intrinsically fainter (and redder) sources should contribute more significantly to the color distribution. To explore this effect, we have computed the median color <ref type="bibr">(Kp − J and Kp − Ks)</ref> as a function of the real apparent infrared magnitude (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig 18)</ref>. The dispersion per bin is fairly large (0.4 − 0.9 mag), but the colors show smooth systematic trends as a function of magnitude with a range of 0.5 − 0.6 mag.</p><p>We have characterized these curves with 5th-order polynomials and have done a linear extrapolation for magnitudes fainter than the data range: The trends seen in the color vs. magnitude relationships are not unexpected. At the brighter magnitudes, the distribution of stars is dominated by infrared bright stars (i.e. giants) and thus, are dominated by relatively red stars. As the magnitude limit is increased, the dwarf stars begin to contribute to the color distribute starting with the bluer (more luminous) stars and the median colors become bluer. As the magnitude limits are pushed even further, the intrinsically fainter (i.e., red) dwarf stars begin to dominate the sample, and the median colors become increasingly red as the magnitude limit is increased.      <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Estimated frequencies ν nl of HD 179070 (in µHz).        Internal errors of ∼2m/s are added in quadrature to 5m/s of jitter to account for uncertainty in the measurements due to spectral type. A Keplerian orbit for Kepler-21b is overplotted (see test). The radial velocity amplitude does not correlate to the expected phase of the planet nor is any additional coherent variation observed. The radial velocities therefore provide only an upper limit to the amplitude. The small RMS scatter of 5 m s −1 imposes an upper limit on the planet mass (see text) and rules out a grazing incidence eclipsing binary. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 10</ref>.-Keck velocities vs orbital phase for HD 179070. The velocities exhibit no evidence of coherence with orbital phase, thus offering only a 3σ upper limit to the mass of the planet of ∼20 Earth-masses. The solid line shows the expected RV curve for a 10.4 Earth-mass planet orbiting HD 179070 (see §8).  Only blends inside the solid white contour match the Kepler light curve within acceptable limits (3σ, where sigma is the significance level of the χ 2 difference compared to a transit model fit; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Fressin et al. 2011</ref>). Lighter-colored areas (red, orange, yellow) mark regions of parameter space giving increasingly worse fits to the data (4σ, 5σ, etc.), and correspond to blends we consider to be ruled out. The hatched blue region on the lower left corresponds to blends that can be excluded because of their overall r − K s colors, which are too red compared to the measured index for HD 179070, by more than 3σ (0.10 mag). A smaller similar region is visible on the right. Blends that are bright enough to have been detected spectroscopically are indicated by the hatched green area, corresponding to contaminating stars that are up to 3 mag fainter than the target. The faintest blends that remain can be as much as 7 mag dimmer than the target (dashed green line). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 15</ref>.-Similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 14</ref> for the case of hierarchical triple systems in which the secondary star is transited by a planet, mimicking the signal in HD 179070. In this case the vertical axis represents the radius of those planets. Blends inside the white 3-σ contour have light curves that match the shape observed for HD 179070. While the r − K s colors of these blends are indistinguishable from that of a single star like HD 179070 at the 3-σ level, the stars involved are all bright enough that most would have been detected in our high-resolution spectra as a second set of lines.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>03 mag in the derivation of the J − Ks color and the Kepler magnitude (Kp). Deblending the infrared photometry results in the following infrared magnitudes for the primary target and faint companion of J = 7.24±0.07 and 11.94±0.07 mag,respectively, and Ks = 6.97 ± 0.07 and Ks = 10.92 ± 0.07 mag, where we have propagated the uncertainties of the faint companion on to the photometry of both stars. The infrared colors of the faint companion is J − Ks = 1.0 ± 0.1 mag, which corresponds to a Kp − Ks color of Kp − Ks = 3.54 ± 0.14 mag if the faint star is a dwarf and a color of Kp − Ks = 3.35 ± 0.14 mag if the faint star is a giant. Applying the deblended Ks magnitude of the companion (Ks = 10.92 ± 0.07 mag), we derive a magnitude for the faint star in the Kepler bandpass for the dwarf-and giant- star relationships of Kp = 14.5 ± 0.2 mag and Kp = 14.3 ± 0.2 mag, respectively. The companion is fainter than the primary target, in the Kepler bandpass, by ∆Kp = 6.3 mag if the star is dwarf and ∆Kp = 6.1 mag if the star is a giant. Note the primary star dominates the photometry in the Kepler aperture; after deblending the Kepler magnitude of the star changes from Kp = 8.224 mag to Kp = 8.227 mag if the companion is a dwarf or to Kp = 8.228 mag if the companion is a giant. The above relationships only work if both J and Ks magnitudes are known, but often only one of the filters is available. Being able to convert a single J and Ks magnitude into an expected Kp is extremely useful -particularly, for determining sensitivity limits for the AO imaging. Towards this end we have utilized the Kepler Input Catalog to determine the expected Kp − J and Kp − Ks colors for a given J or Ks magnitude. Histograms of the Kp − J and Kp − Ks colors are shown in Figure 18 where the median and mode of the color are marked; the spread in color, as described by the dispersion of the colors, is fairly large. The medians, modes (both of which are delineated in the histograms), and dispersions of the colors are Kp−J = 1.477, 1.275, and 0.626 mag and Kp−Ks = 2.139, 1.775, and 0.803 mag.</figDesc></figure>

The vertical axis represents the distance between the background star and the target HD 179070, expressed in terms of the difference in the distance modulus. Only blends inside the solid white contour match the Kepler light curve within acceptable limits (3σ, where sigma is the significance level of the χ 2 difference compared to a transit model fit; see Fressin et al. 2011). Lighter-colored areas (red, orange, yellow) mark regions of parameter space giving increasingly worse fits to the data (4σ, 5σ, etc.), and correspond to blends we consider to be ruled out. The hatched blue region on the lower left corresponds to blends that can be excluded because of their overall r − K s colors, which are too red compared to the measured index for HD 179070, by more than 3σ (0.10 mag). A smaller similar region is visible on the right. Blends that are bright enough to have been detected spectroscopically are indicated by the hatched green area, corresponding to contaminating stars that are up to 3 mag fainter than the target. The faintest blends that remain can be as much as 7 mag dimmer than the target (dashed green line).</figDesc></figure>
