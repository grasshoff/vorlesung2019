				<p>We present a theoretical analysis of the optical light curves (LCs) for short-period high-mass transiting extrasolar planet systems. Our method considers the primary transit, the secondary eclipse, and the overall phase shape of the LC between the occultations. Phase variations arise from (i) reflected and thermally emitted light by the planet, (ii) the ellipsoidal shape of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet, and (iii) the Doppler shift of the stellar light as the star orbits the center of mass of the system. Our full model of the out-of-eclipse variations contains information about the planetary mass, orbital eccentricity, the orientation of periastron and the planet&apos;s albedo. For a range of hypothetical systems we demonstrate that the ellipsoidal variations (ii.) can be large enough to be distinguished from the remaining components and that this effect can be used to constrain the planet&apos;s mass. To detect the ellipsoidal variations, the LC requires a minimum precision of 10 −4 , which coincides with the precision of the Kepler mission. As a test of our approach, we consider the Kepler LC of the transiting object HAT-P-7. We are able to estimate the mass of the companion, and confirm its planetary nature solely from the LC data. Future space missions, such as PLATO and the James Webb Space Telescope with even higher photometric precision, will be able to reduce the errors in all parameters. Detailed modeling of any out-of-eclipse variations seen in new systems will be a useful diagnostic tool prior to the requisite ground based radial velocity follow-up.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Two observational methods have dominated the study of extrasolar planets so far: radial velocity (RV) measurements and transit light curve (LC) analyses. Both have advantages and disadvantages. While RV determinations provide estimates of the planetary mass (M p ), the eccentricity (e) and the semi-major axis (a), they do not constrain the inclination (i) of the orbital plane with respect to the observer, thus only lower limits to M p can be determined. The transit method, on the other hand, provides information on i, the ratio of the planetary to the stellar radius (R p /R s ), and the duration of the transit (D). So far, only a combination of both strategies yields a full set of orbital and physical parameters for extrasolar planets.</p><p>Currently, two space-missions are targeted at the detection of transiting extrasolar planets: CoRoT launched in 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deleuil et al. 1997</ref>) and Kepler launched in 2009 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Borucki et al. 1997)</ref>. Their instruments are monitoring hundreds of thousands of stars, discovering thousands of planet candidates, whose RV follow-up will take many years (and may never be completed for the faintest candidates). Without RV follow-up, the most fundamental parameter of an extrasolar planet, its mass, remains undetermined from CoRoT and Kepler observations alone. The mass is the crucial parameter classifying an object as a planet, brown dwarf or a star.</p><p>High-accuracy photometry has already been used for a number of systems to show that the planetary thermal emission, as well as the reflection of the stellar light from the planet, are detectable. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Welsh et al. (2010)</ref> report the discovery of ellipsoidal variations in the Kepler LC of HAT-P-7. This is an effect more commonly known from close stellar systems, where phase-dependent light variation arises from the gravitationally distorted stars. In HAT-P-7, the planet is close enough and massive enough to induce the same effect.</p><p>Other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Loeb &amp; Gaudi 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Faigler &amp; Mazeh 2011)</ref> have already presented treatments of reflected light, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming. Our approach to the problem includes two main differences: (i) we investigate the sensitivity of our technique on the adopted phase function <ref type="bibr">(Section 3.2)</ref>, and (ii) we attempt to solve separately for the reflected light and thermal emission from the planet. For hot Jupiters around hot stars, the temperature of the planet increases dramatically and reflected light alone fails to explain the LC.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate whether the presence of ellipsoidal variations in a planetary system can be used to place meaningful constraints on the mass of the planetary companion. In Sect. 2 we describe the basic phenomena included in our simplified model of a planetary system's LC. In Sect. 3 we compare the magnitudes of the relative contributions and consider the likely range of planetary systems for which ellipsoidal variations ought to be detectable with both CoRoT and Kepler. We reanalyze the HAT-P-7 LC and demonstrate that the ellipsoidal variations can be used to estimate the mass of the planet to within 10% of the radial-velocity measured mass. We summarize our conclusions in Sect. 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Parametrization of photometric transits</head><p>Standard models of LCs that have been used before the advent of space missions are based on a flat curve out of transit and a limb darkening during the transit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas (2003)</ref> proved analytically that for each package of planet-star characteristics there is a unique LC. Analyses of high-accuracy data from space required a revision of this simple approach. For a high accuracy LC, the model should incorporate the reflected light from the planet, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler boosting, which deforms the overall shape of the LC, and the secondary eclipse <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The standard transit model includes the primary transit f 1 (dashed line centred at orbital phase z = 0), the secondary eclipse f 2 (dotted line around z = 0.5) and the reflected light from the planet f 3 (solid line). The model is based on a HAT-7-b twin planet <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2 )</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> we show the geometry of an arbitrary transiting system assuming an elliptical orbit. Let i be the angle between the observer's line of sight and the orbital plane normal, while the angle between the observer's line of sight projected onto the orbit plane and the periastron is labeled φ. The star is in the center of the reference frame and d is the distance between the star and the planet; the distance between the star and the planet during the primary transit is denoted by d PT ⋆,p , during the secondary eclipse both bodies are separated by the distance d SE ⋆,p . To decode the geometry of the system from the LC we split it into three sub LCs. LC f 1 describes the course of the primary transit, when the planet blocks the star's light, f 2 describes the form of the secondary eclipse, when the star blocks and planetary light, and f 3 the rest of the LC, when both star and planet contribute to the total amount of light.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Transit and Eclipse</head><p>The duration of the transit f 1 is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D ≃ PR ⋆ πa 2 d d PT ⋆,p √ 1 − e 2 1 + R p R ⋆ 2 − b 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where a d is the semi-major axis of the system, P is the orbital period, R ⋆ and R p are the radius of the star and the planet, respectively, e is the orbital eccentricity, b = d PT ⋆,p cos i/R ⋆ is the impact parameter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ford et al. 2008</ref>) and i is the inclination of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. This sketch of the transiting planetary system, as seen from above, explains the variables used in our calculations. We assume clockwise rotation. the orbital plane with respect to the observer's line of sight. To model the shape of f 1 we use Eq. (1) and the limb darkening equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I µ I 0 = 1 − u 1 (1 − µ) − u 2 (1 − µ) 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with u 1 and u 2 the linear and quadratic limb darkening coefficients respectively <ref type="bibr">(Claret 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sozzetti et al. 2007</ref>), µ as the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the observer, and I 0 and I µ as the intensities at the stellar disk center and at µ, respectively. Once the period is known from observations, one can fit the model to the observations to deduce R ⋆ , R p , i, and d PT ⋆,p . The transit of the secondary eclipse, f 2 , is fitted with the same model but without the effects of limb darkening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Phase-dependent light curve</head><p>The shape of the LC between the transit and the eclipse ( f 3 ) contains five contributions: (i) f ⋆ , a contribution from the stellar photospheric flux, which almost certainly varies with time, but which we assume to be constant throughout this analysis;</p><p>(ii) f ref , a contribution from starlight reflected from the face of the planet, which is phase dependent; (iii) f th contributions from the intrinsic planetary thermal emission (split by day and night), which depends sensitively on a large number of factors, including the spectral range of the observation λ, the irradiation temperature, and the atmospheric composition and structure; (iv) f ell , a contribution from ellipsoidal variations of the star itself due to tidal forces from the planet; (v) flux variations f dop due to a Doppler shift (Doppler boosting) of the stellar spectral energy distribution with respect to the bandpass of the instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Mazeh &amp; Faigler 2010)</ref>. We normalize the LC by the stellar flux, which can be determined as the minimum flux observed at phase z = 0.5.

For the most of our analysis we assume that the planet emits as a black body. Anyhow, the differences between a black body and a non-black body emission are small (a factor of 1.5-3.5, see Hansen 2008). Assuming main sequence stars and planetary energy circulation ǫ = 0.0 (for the maximum thermal emission assuming black bodies), we found that for most hot Jupiters, the thermal emission from the planet is very weak in optical wavelengths. For our analysis we assume a blackbody, observed through the Kepler's sensitivity curve, which peaks at 575nm and covers 420 to 900nm (Kepler <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Thermal emission flux maps for three different bolometric albedo values (top : α bol = 0.0, middle α bol = 0.3, bottom: α bol = 0.5). Thermal emission is stronger for short term period planets around hot stars. For all the plots, we assume R P = 1.0R J . The white part of the diagram refers to f th &lt; 10 −7 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Simulations</head><p>To assess the data accuracy required by our method to yield satisfying constraints on the planetary parameters, we simulate two LCs using the equations from above. One of our model planetary systems is a hot Jupiter, analogue to the transiting planet HAT-P-7b ( <ref type="bibr">Pál et al. 2009b</ref>), whereas the other one resembles the transiting Super-Earth CoRoT-7b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Queloz et al. 2009</ref>). We customize these models in terms of the geometric albedo, for which we optimistically apply α g = 0.3 in both cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sudarsky et al. 2000)</ref>. Though observations of CoRoT-7b are reconcilable with e = 0, we chose e = 0.05 to simulate enhanced phase variations in the LC. After all, we are not heading for a reconstruction of these systems but we want to estimate how accurate comparable systems could be parametrized and, as an example, if a putative small eccentricity of CoRoT-7b could be determined. This is particularly important given the significant activity of CoRoT-7b.</p><p>To these models, we add increasingly more noise simulating data accuracies between 10 −7 and 10 −4 . The phase effect in the LCs, i.e. in f 3 , is significant only for accuracies 10 −4 , which is why this phenomenon has not been detected in the LCs of CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Costes et al. 2004</ref>). We then fit the noiseless model from Sect. 2 to each of these -more or less -noisy LCs and use 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the standard deviations for each parameter in each fit using a bootstrap method explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alonso et al. (2008)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 5</ref> we show the relative errors resulting from these fits for the planetary geometrical albedo α g (σ α g /α g ), eccentricity (σ e /e), orientation of periastron (σ ω /ω) and the mass ratio (σ M /M) as a function of the root mean square (RMS) of the data. With an accuracy provided by Kepler of 10 −4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Koch et al. 2010)</ref>, the eccentricity of a CoRoT7b-like Super-Earth could merely be determined with a unsatis- factory relative error higher than 1.0 which has no physical use. For a hot Jupiter similar to HAT-P-2b, however, the relative error in e is about 0.001 in the best case (hot Jupiter -RMS 10 −7 ). The orientation of periastron for the Super-Earth could be constrained to approximately ±4 • in the worse case (RMS 10 −4 ) while for the hot Jupiter the accuracy is as low as ±0.001 • in the best case (RMS 10 −7 ). Restrictions of the geometrical albedo α g are ±0.001 in the best case (hot Jupiter -RMS 10 −7 ) to ± 1.1 in the worst case (Earth like -RMS 10 −4 ) with no physical meaning. The respective accuracies in planet mass M P are ±0.028 M J for hot Jupiters (best case) and ±0.95 M J for Super-Earths (worst case).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Relative Contributions</head><p>Different phase functions (eqs. (6) &amp; <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref>) lead to different peaks in the thermal emission and reflected LC. The ratio between thermal emission and reflected light over ellipsoidal variations becomes smaller (for the Lambert sphere) or larger (for the geometrical sphere), which is why different phase functions lead to different mass values. The mass difference (∆M P ) between the two cases is a constant (36.4%). For example, if we use a wrong sphere, the mass we measure for HAT-P-7b exoplanet is ∆M P ∼ 0.67M J smaller (geometrical) or larger (Lambert) than the true mass. Seeking out the most plausible phase function, we fit two models, both differing only in the assumption of either the Lambertian or the geometrical sphere, to the data. For most systems, if the components f re f , f th &amp; f ell are very weak, it is impossible to distinguish between the two phase functions. In this case we select the Lambert sphere in order to calculate the upper mass limit of the planet. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 6</ref> we show the residuals between the two different phase functions. Notice that the shape and the phase (x-axis) of residuals is identical to ellipsoidal variations curve.</p><p>For most hot Jupiter systems thermal emission in optical wavelengths is much weaker than variations due to the varying projected shape of the star. For orbital periods of 1 and 5 days of a G0V star, ellipsoidal variations are 3 and 10 times larger than thermal emission, respectively, while f th / f ⋆ ∼ 10 −5 and 10 −9 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3 &amp; 4)</ref>. As the star becomes hotter (F or A type), or the period shorter (&lt; 5 days), the thermal component become to be more significant.</p><p>Thermal emission, stellar ellipsoidal deformations, and Doppler shift changes are very weak phenomena (fainter than 10 −5 ), which require very high-accuracy observations to be detected. So far, it has been impossible to detect these effects from the ground but based on data from the recent space-based mission Kepler, our system of equations offers a new gate for exoplanet mass determinations. Neither RV measurements nor transit timing variations are necessary for our procedure.</p><p>Our parametrization of reflected and thermal planetary emission are nearly identical, so our model is by definition unable to distinguish between these two effects. Both equations 5 and 16 are only function of the orbital phase (Φ L,C ) and both components (thermal and reflected) provide exactly the same LC. We are not able to distinguish between the two components by fitting our model in a hot Jupiter system, which the planet is tidal locked by its host star. If the planetary rotation and orbital period are different (for a case of a high eccentric orbit and the simple assumption that there are no winds), then reflected light and thermal emission LCs will show different shapes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Application to Kepler data: The Case of HAT-P-7b</head><p>Kepler is a space-based mission, launched on Mar. 7, 2009, with the primary goal to detect Earth-sized and smaller planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. For a m V = 12 star, the photometric precision is log 10 (RMS) ∼ −4.35 for 6 hr combined differential photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>). We choose the wellstudied transiting planet HAT-P-7 in the Kepler field, with mass and system parameters constrained by both photometric and RV observations, to test our photometry-only method. We use all the short exposure data (1 minute exposures) from Kepler's public archive. Our sample includes 67 transits and the phase folded LC was made by ∼ 180, 000 epochs binned by a factor of ∼ 50. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Welsh et al. (2010)</ref> already found ellipsoidal variations in HAT-P-7. Using the established physical parameters of the system, we calculate that the effect of ( f ell ∼ 3.1 · 10 −5 ) is ∼ 3.56 times more pronounced than the Doppler shift variations ( f dop ∼ 8.7 · 10 −6 ). Nevertheless, we include both effects in our model.</p><p>We assume that the stellar radius and effective temperature are known (T eff = 6350K). We fix the ratio of stellar and planetary radius R p /R ⋆ = 0.0778, the inclination i = 83.1 • and the relative semi-major axis a/R ⋆ = 8. <ref type="bibr">22 (Welsh et al. 2010</ref>). For our first fit, we use Eq. 3, but we exclude f ell and f dop . We only fit f re f plus f th in order to check if only these two components could successfully explain the data (χ 2 ref+th ). Our second fit includes all four components from Eq. 3 (χ 2 all ). The χ 2 ratio between the reflected light plus the thermal emission model and the model which includes all four components is χ 2 ref+th /χ 2 all = 3.04. Using an F-test, we found that the complete model explains the  HAT-P-7b system parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">PLATO mission</head><p>PLATO is a prospective ESA mission aiming at the characterization of transiting exoplanets. The mission will use 40 small telescopes covering 42 × 42 deg 2 in total with a supposed overall accuracy of ∼ 2.8 · 10 −5 (Claudi 2010). This will satisfy the needs of our procedure. In the following, we demonstrate the capabilities of our photometry-only method in parameterizing hypothetical exoplanet systems.</p><p>We investigate the detectability of f ell and f dop in a range of different systems, assuming that our target stars belong to the main sequence. For each combination we calculate the amplitude of the flux variations ∆F in the LC. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 8</ref> we present three plots, each belonging to a different planetary mass: M p = 0.5 M J (top), 1 M J (middle), and 5 M J (bottom). For comparison we indicate some known transiting systems with similar masses. In the upper panel ∆F is dominated by f ell . Here, for the sample of known systems ∆F &gt; 10 −5 , which would be challenging to be detected. Nevertheless, with PLATO one will be able to detect f ell for planets with P &lt; 3 d around stars with spectral type K0 or later (blue zone in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 8</ref>). In the middle diagram (M p = 1M J ) both f ell and f dop affect the LC and ∆F ∼ 5 · 10 −5 for most of the known systems -detectable with PLATO. In the bottom panel, where the model planet is most massive, the LCs are mostly affected by the Doppler shift variations rather than by the ellipsoidal geometry of the star. The phenomenon is fairly detectable for the most cases of the known planets while ∆F ∼ 12 · 10 −5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The mathematical tools presented in this article can be used for a complete parametrization of transiting exoplanet systems on the basis of high-accuracy LCs only. In our model, for a specific range of systems, RV measurements are not necessary to constrain the mass of the planet (M p ), orbital eccentricity (e), the orientation of periastron (ω), and the geometric albedo of the planet (α g ). Our model also incorporates the characterization of the ratio of planetary and stellar radius (R p /R ⋆ ), orbital period (P), and the orbital inclination (i). In order for this method to be fully applicable, the planet must be massive enough and orbit its host star close enough as to distort the stellar structure significantly.</p><p>With the current Kepler and potential future missions such as PLATO, we are able to measure the mass of the hot Jupiters, where the orbital periods must be ≤ 1.5, ≤ 4, and ≤ 10 days in order to measure planetary masses of 0.5 M J , 1 M J , and 5 M J respectively. Furthermore, for host stars with spectral types earlier than FV, thermal emission component is detectable in the LC (assuming black bodies). This will affect the accuracy and even the detection of ellipsoidal variation.</p><p>As we show, the Kepler mission provides an accuracy suitable enough for our procedure to be applied for the characterization of extrasolar planets. We confirm the planetary natures of the hot Jupiters HAT-P-7 from Kepler data alone. Our method yields masses of M p = 1.27 +0.10 −0.45 M J × M ⋆ /M ⊙ for HAT-P-7b. Our results (M P , α g , α bol , e, T d , T n ) are in good agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Welsh et al. (2010)</ref> and we also confirm the ellipsoidal variations of HAT-P-7b system. Using ellipsoidal variations we calculate the planetary mass from the photometric LC itself, without any RV measurments. Our technique will benefit from future space missions such as PLATO and the James Webb Space Telescope ( <ref type="bibr">Deming et al. 2009</ref>) with RMS ∼ 3 · 10 −5 and 10 −6 , respectively. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc>Fig. 6.
