				<p>We present in this paper the results of searching the Kepler Q2 public dataset for the secondary eclipses of 76 hot Jupiter planet candidates from the list of 1,235 candidates published by Borucki et al. (2011). This search has been performed by modeling both the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curves and new light curves produced via our own photometric pipeline. We derive new stellar and planetary parameters for each system, while calculating robust errors for both. We find 16 systems with 1-2σ, 14 systems with 2-3σ, and 6 systems with &gt;3σ confidence level secondary eclipse detections in at least one light curve produced via the Kepler pre-search data conditioned light curve or our own pipeline, however, results can vary depending on the light curve modeled and whether eccentricity is allowed to vary or not. We estimate false alarm probabilities of 31%, 10%, and 6% for the 1-2σ, 2-3σ, and &gt;3σ confidence intervals respectively. Comparing each secondary eclipse result to theoretical expectations, we find that the majority of detected planet candidates emit more light than expected due to thermal blackbody emission in the optical Kepler bandpass, and present a trend of increasing excess emission with decreasing maximum effective planetary temperature. These results agree with previously published optical secondary eclipse data for other hot Jupiters. We explore modeling biases, significant planetary albedos, non-LTE or other thermal emission, significant internal energy generation, and mis-identification of brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, or stellar blends as possible causes of both the excess emission and its correlation with expected planetary temperature. Although we find no single cause is able to explain all of the planet candidates, significant planetary albedos, with a general trend of increasing planetary albedos with decreasing atmospheric temperatures, is able to explain most of the systems. Identifying systems that we deem likely to be low-mass stars or stellar blends, we estimate an 11% false positive rate in the current Kepler planet candidate sample of hot Jupiters. We also establish robust upper limits on the eclipse depth for the remaining systems, and find that the emission of a significant fraction of these systems is consistent with the planets having very low albedos, i.e., at least 30% of all systems have A g &lt; 0.3 at 1σ confidence levels. This result augments the current number of constrained exoplanetary albedos and extends the sample of low albedo determinations to planets with temperatures as low as 1200 K. Finally, we note that continued observations with the Kepler spacecraft, and improved techniques for the removal of systematic noise in the Kepler data, are needed to better characterize these systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Measuring the secondary eclipses of transiting exoplanets at optical wavelengths is a powerful tool for probing their atmospheres, in particular their albedos, brightness temperatures, and energy redistribution factors. The Kepler mission has recently uncovered over a thousand new transiting planet candidates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>), which provide an unprecedented and uniform sample of high photometric precision light curves among which secondary eclipse signals can be detected.</p><p>In the past decade, many surprising discoveries regarding the atmospheric properties of hot Jupiters have been made. For example, many hot Jupiters appear to have temperature inversions, with numerous proposed explanations, but no definitive evidence for exactly which physical processes are involved ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fortney et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Burrows et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Spiegel et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zahnle et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Knutson et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Madhusudhan &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>. Other results have found that the atmospheric composition of different planets vary significantly, or that they present a wide range of heat circulation efficiencies between their day and night sides (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe et al. 2010</ref>, and references therein).</p><p>Most of the observations yielding to those discoveries have been done in the mid-infrared (3.6 -24 µm) with Spitzer. Observations at shorter wavelengths are more scarce, especially in the visible, but most of them point towards the predominance of very low geometric albedo, (A g &lt; 0.3 at the 3σ level upper limits), atmospheres in hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Charbonneau et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leigh et al. 2003a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rodler et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Rodler et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Rowe et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alonso et al. 2009a</ref><ref type="bibr">Alonso et al. ,b, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Snellen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Christiansen et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Welsh et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kipping &amp; Bakos 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kipping &amp; Spiegel 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Désert et al. 2011a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Langford et al. 2011</ref>), in contrast to the up to A g = 0.5 albedos observed in the colder gas giants in our Solar System <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Karkoschka 1994)</ref>. Those results are in fair agreement with early theoretical models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Marley et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sudarsky et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Seager et al. 2000)</ref>, which predict significant absorption of the incident stellar radiation in the visible by sodium and potassium, followed by re-emission in the infrared. Other molecules, such as TiO, VO, and HS, have also been suggested as possible strong optical absorbers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Zahnle et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>However, three recent studies suggest higher geometric albedos for two planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berdyugina et al. (2011)</ref> have published a value of A g = 0.28±0.16 for HD 189733b via polarized reflected light 5 , while <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Demory et al. (2011)</ref> respectively suggest albedos of A g = 0.38±0.12 and A g = 0.32±0.03 for Kepler-7b based on measurements of the emission of the planet with Kepler during secondary eclipse. Some plausible explanations for such high albedos include Rayleigh scattering and the presence of clouds or hazes in the atmospheres of those planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Demory et al. 2011</ref>). Also, in the case of the hottest planets, some amount of thermal emission could be contributing to the measured emission levels in the reddest edge of the observed visible wavelength windows (e.g., at λ ∼ 0.8 µm).</p><p>Although new theoretical work is necessary to determine the cause of apparently high albedos in some hot Jupiters, the key answer to whether these results are typical or not relies on more observations, since the current discussions are based on a statistically insufficient sample of only three planets. The purpose of this work is to significantly increase that sample by searching for the emission of hot Jupiters among the publicly available Kepler light curves of planet candidates reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>. Given the photometric precision of the Kepler data and the wavelength coverage of the Kepler passband (0.4 -0.9 µm), these datasets provide unprecedented quality data to detect the secondary eclipses of those planets in the visible and statistically determine the albedos of hot Jupiters. Furthermore, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> do no explicitly state how they modeled their light curves or obtained their parameters, a re-modeling of the data will perform an independent test on the methods they employed.</p><p>In addition to providing estimations of the planetary albedo, measuring the timing and duration of the secondary eclipse, when coupled with the primary eclipse, can directly measure the orbital eccentricity of a system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>). Also, if there is a significant flux contrast between the day and night side of the planet, one may be able to measure the varying amount of emitted light by the planet in the light curve, and directly measure the day-to-night contrast ratio ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Harrington et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>). Even a robust upper limit on the eclipse depth can narrow the range of possible planetary albedos and yield useful information on the statistics of exoplanetary albedos.</p><p>In §2 we present our target selection criteria and describe how we reprocess the Kepler light curves from the pixel-level data. In §3 we describe how we model the data using the JKTEBOP code, and obtain robust errors on all parameters while accounting for potential systematic noise. We present our derived physical parameters of both the planet candidates and their host stars in §4, and in §5 we examine possible trends in our results. In §6 we discuss individual candidates of interest, and finally in §7 we summarize our findings and examine possible future directions for the study of this sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONAL DATA</head><p>The first step of our analysis consisted of selecting a set of planet candidates suitable for secondary eclipse detection among the 1,235 planet candidates published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>. We made a pre-selection of potentially detectable objects using the planetary and stellar parameters listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>, choosing only those systems with P &lt; 5 days and R p &gt; 0.5 R J , after estimating that planets with longer orbital periods and smaller radii are too cool, too small, or too far away from their host star to produce deep enough secondary eclipse signals to be detectable by Kepler, even in the most extreme albedo conditions (i.e., A g = 1.0). Our secondary eclipse depth estimations also account for the amount of stellar irradiation, given the effective temperature of the stars reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref>. The result is a list of 76 candidates.</p><p>The next step consisted of an inspection of the Kepler light curves of those 76 targets.</p><p>The analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> uses the first four months of Kepler observations, which include quarters Q0, Q1, and Q2. However, significantly discrepant systematic noise patterns exist between the light curves from different quarters, which result in additional noise when all the data are combined. Therefore, we decided to use only the data from Q2, which alone contains continuous 90-day observation coverage and is well suited for our search.</p><p>We modeled two different light curves for each target: the Presearch Data Conditioned (PDC) light curve, and our own generated light curves that we produced using the pixel-level data and our own photometric pipeline. In the remainder of the paper we refer to this second analysis as the CLM pipeline. As detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jenkins et al. (2010b)</ref>, the first step in creating the PDC light curves was correcting the pixel level data for bias pattern noise, dark current, gain, non-linearity, cosmic rays, shutter smearing, pixel-to-pixel sensitivity, and other pixel-level effects. The calibrated pixels were then run through a Photometric Analysis (PA) that measures and subtracts background flux, and sums up pixels within a photometric aperture for each star, creating the PA light curve. The size of those apertures are defined such that it is supposed to maximize the mean signal-to-noise for each star. The PA light curves were then subjected to Pre-Search Data Conditioning which attempts to remove systematic effects due to temperature, focus, pointing, and other effects by correlating with ancillary engineering data. The PDC module also corrects for any sudden jumps in the data, for example due to sudden pointing changes or pixel sensitivities due to cosmic ray hits, as well as removes excess flux in the photometric aperture due to crowding.</p><p>During our inspection of the PDC data we noted that, despite the thorough analysis detailed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jenkins et al. (2010b)</ref>, many of the PDC light curves produced by the Kepler PDC pipeline still contain significant systematic trends at a level of couple percent variation, an effect that can significantly hinder the detection of secondary eclipses and phase brightness variations. Upon thorough examination of the pixel-level data, PA, and PDC light curves, we concluded that the majority of the trends correlate with and are due to the 0.1-0.5 pixel centroid position drift experienced by the majority of the target stars each quarter. This drift is principally due to Differential Velocity Aberration (DVA), where the amount of stellar aberration introduced by the spacecraft's velocity varies over the large field of view, resulting in the shifting of stellar positions on the detector as large as 0.6 pixels over a 90 day period ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jenkins et al. 2010c</ref>). Spacecraft pointing error only accounts for 0.05 pixels of the total movement ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jenkins et al. 2010c</ref>). This drift in the stellar position causes light from the wings of each star's point spread function to enter and leave the optimal photometric aperture at different rates, resulting in a flux variance of several percent over each quarter. To remove those effects we re-analyzed the Kepler pixel-level data using the CLM pipeline.</p><p>The CLM photometric pipeline starts with the calibrated pixel-level data, with background flux removed from each pixel. As the majority of target stars are wellisolated, we simply summed up the flux for every pixel that was downloaded from the spacecraft for each star. We find that this removes the majority of long-term systematic variations due to DVA, usually producing light curves with significantly less systematic noise than the similarly produced PA light curves. Usually the only time summing up all the pixels produced more systematic noise is when there was significant crowding in the field by comparably bright stars, but we find this only affects a small fraction of the selected transiting planet candidates, and note that crowding can still significantly affect PA photometry as well.</p><p>Even after minimizing the amount of light variation within the aperture, pixel-to-pixel sensitivity, both in spectral response as well as quantum efficiency, and intrapixel variations, still produced significant systematics. We cut out areas of significant systematic variation, which principally occur around BJD 2455015 and BJD 2455065, due to a safe mode event and a pointing tweak. Then, we performed a correlation-based Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Murtagh &amp; Heck 1987)</ref> on the pixel level data, and subtract out the first three PCA components, thus removing the majority of major systematic noise, which is still principally correlated with the large position drift. We have checked and verified that this does not remove or significantly modify the transit signal for any system. We then fit a Bézier curve ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kahaner et al. 1989</ref>) to the data, performed a 3-sigma rejection, re-fit a Bézier curve, and then divided by the fit. This iterative procedure does an excellent job of removing any possible remaining low-frequency systematic features in the data without removing or affecting the transits or real high-frequency stellar variations. We then, for only a few systems, removed one or two points that were extremely significant outliers. For one system, KOI 433.01, we removed a single transit that was clearly from another long-period companion in the system. For both the Kepler PDC and CLM light curves, we finally subtracted a linear trend to ensure the light curves were completely flat before modeling (see §3).</p><p>We would like to note that, as a possible technique of removing systematic noise, we also attempted to directly solve for a pixel mask that would account for pixelto-pixel variation in quantum efficiency and spectral response. Every image in the time series was multiplied by this pixel mask, whose values ranged from 0 to 1, and then the pixel fluxes summed to produce a corrected light curve. We used an asexual genetic algorithm, similar to that presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Coughlin et al. (2011)</ref>, to solve for the values of each pixel in the pixel mask that produced corrected light curves with a minimum amount of systematic noise, defined via various methods. We found that the technique was very successful at removing nearly all systematic noise from the light curves. However, depending on the minimization criteria selected, we found that the algorithm was prone to over-correct the light curve, and remove features due to real astrophysical phenomena. As well, even when it did appear to remove the systematic trends and not the real astrophysical signatures, it was difficult to tell, unlike with the PCA analysis, whether or not the solution had a real physical basis. Thus, we decided not to employ this technique in our analysis. However, with more work or a better understanding of the systematic noise sources, it might become a viable means for removing systematic noise from Kepler, and possibly other, light curves.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 1</ref> we plot the Kepler PA and PDC light curves, our CLM light curves, (including those from simply summing up all the pixels in each frame, applying the PCA correction, and then applying the Bezier correction), the centroid positions, averaged pixel-level image, and the aperture used in the Kepler PA and PDC photometry, for each of the 76 candidate systems. Of the original 76 candidates, 36 were deemed unmodelable based on their PDC light curves, due to either strong systematics or intrinsic stellar variability with amplitudes on the order of, or greater than, the depth of the transits. The 36 discarded systems were KOI 1. <ref type="bibr">01, 17.01, 20.01, 127.01, 128.01, 135.01, 183.01, 194.01, 203.01, 208.01, 214.01, 217.01, 254.01, 256.01, 552.01, 554.01, 609.01, 667.01, 767.01, 823.01, 882.01, 883.01, 895.01, 981.01, 1152.01, 1176.01, 1177.01, 1227.01, 1285.01, 1382.01, 1448.01, 1452.01, 1540.01, 1541.01, 1543.01, and 1546.01.</ref> In the case of our newly generated CLM pipeline light curves, 26 candidates turned out to be unmodelable, most of them due to stellar variability, as in the case of the PDC light curves above, or due to blends in the images resulting in significant light contamination of the target light curves. The 26 systems discarded in this case <ref type="bibr">were KOI 102.01, 135.01, 194.01, 199.01, 208</ref> We now highlight a few systems to illustrate the different types of systematic and stellar noise in the Kepler data, and differences between the PDC and CLM light curves. For KOI 17.01, (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 1</ref>.6), the PA and PDC light curves both show a ∼1.7% systematic variation over the quarter, as the PA/PDC aperture does not encompass many pixels in the wing of the PSF that contain significant signal, and the star experiences a ∼0.4 pixel drift over the quarter. In contrast, the raw pixelsummed CLM light curve shows only a ∼0.54% systematic variation, and the PCA-corrected and Beziercorrected CLM light curves show virtually no remaining systematic noise. For KOI 102.01 and 199.01, (see <ref type="figure">Fig- ures</ref> 1.11 and 1.22), there is a close companion star that causes the CLM photometry to produce much worse light curves than the PDC data. In the case of KOI 102.01, significant systematics are introduced in the CLM light curve from the movement of the companion in and out of the frame, given the ∼0.3 pixel drift over the quarter, and as well the extra third light causes the transits of the primary to be damped out. In the case of KOI 199.01, the companion is an eclipsing binary, and its light curve is imposed on top of that of the transiting system. Significant systematics are still present in the PA data in these two cases, but much less so than the CLM data, and they appear to be removed in the PDC data. In the cases of KOI 256.01 and KOI 1452.01, (see Figures 1.32 and 1.71), the stars exhibit clear high-frequency variations at the same level as the transits, possibly due to stellar pulsation or rapid rotation and star spots. Note that the CLM pipeline does not remove the stellar signal because it is high-frequency and intrinsic to the system, and also that for KOI 256.01 additional long-term systematic noise is present in the Kepler PA and PDC data due to the small aperture they employ and the ∼0.35 pixel drift, but does not exist in the CLM data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LIGHT CURVE MODELING</head><p>We used the JKTEBOP eclipsing binary modeling code ( <ref type="bibr">Southworth et al. 2004a,b)</ref>, which is based on the EBOP code <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Etzel 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Popper &amp; Etzel 1981)</ref>, to model both the Kepler PDC light curves and our own CLM pipeline light curves for the 55 modelable systems. In short, JKTEBOP 6 models the projection of each star as a biaxial ellipsoid and calculates light curves by numerical integration of concentric circles over each star, and is well-suited to modeling detached eclipsing binaries or transiting extrasolar planets. We modeled each light curve first fixing the eccentricity to e = 0, and then leaving it as a free parameter. The reason for leaving e as a free parameter is that, even though systems with P &lt; 5 days are generally expected to be circularized, additional bodies in the system or other evolutionary effects can perturb their orbits. Indeed, at the time of this writing, ∼36% of currently known transiting planets with P &lt; 5 days have a measured non-zero eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schneider 2011</ref>). Therefore, since we are performing a blind search for secondary eclipses, restricting the search to only circular orbits might result in detection biases. The results between fixing e = 0 and letting it vary can 6 For more information on JKTEBOP, see http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/codes/jktebop.html sometimes vary significantly, as shown at the end of this section.</p><p>For both cases of either fixing e = 0 or letting it vary, we also simultaneously solved for the orbital period of the system, P , time of primary transit minimum, T 0 , the inclination of the orbit, i, e·cos(ω) and e·sin(ω), where ω is the longitude of periastron, the planet-to-star surface brightness ratio, J, the sum of the fractional radii, r sum , the planet-to-star radii ratio, k, and the out-of-eclipse (baseline) flux. (We note for clarity that the relation between J, k, and the planet-to-star luminosity ratio, L r , is L r = k 2 J.) To account for any potential brightness variations with phase, we also multiply the planet's luminosity, L p , by a factor of one plus a sinusoidal curve, so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L p (T ) = L p + A Lp · sin 2π(T − T 0 ) P − π 2 (1)</formula><p>where L p (T ) is the planet's luminosity at a given observed time, T , and A Lp , for which we solve, is the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve. Note that we have fixed the period of this sine wave to the orbital period of each system, and fixed the reference zero phase so that the maximum amplitude peak coincides with the center of the secondary eclipse. Although there has been at least one case of a measured planetary brightness phase curve having its maximum offset from secondary eclipse in the infrared ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knutson et al. 2007</ref>), many optical observations indicate planetary brightness phase curve maximums coincident with the secondary eclipse ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Snellen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Welsh et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bonomo et al. 2011</ref>). We note that a value of A Lp = 0.0 implies no brightness variations with phase. A value of A Lp = 0.2 implies the planet is 20% brighter at phase 0.5, when the day-side is visible, and 20% fainter at phase 1.0, when the night-side is visible, compared to phases 0.25 and 0.75. A value of A Lp = 1.0 implies a perfectly dark night-side. Negative values of A Lp would imply a brighter night-side than day-side, which is not physically expected, but allowed for in the code so as not to introduce any bias towards positive values of A Lp . Note also that J is allowed to be both positive and negative so as not to introduce any bias towards positive values of J, and thus false detections. In both cases we assumed a quadratic limb-darkening law for the stars, and fixed coefficients to the values found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sing (2010)</ref> for the Kepler bandpass, using the estimated stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. We also set the values of the gravity darkening coefficients to those derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Claret (2000)</ref>, based on the effective temperature of the stars. Even though we fix the limb and gravity darkening coefficients, they are computed from stellar models and have an associated uncertainty when compared to reality. As the choice of these coefficients can affect the determination of other system parameters, their uncertainty must be taken into account in the error analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Claret (2008)</ref> determined this uncertainty to be ∼10%, and thus we allowed the values of the limb and gravity darkening coefficients to vary over a range of ±10% during the error estimation analysis, described below.</p><p>Finally, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kipping (2010)</ref>, sparse sam-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 1</ref>.

The bottom left panel is the average image of all the frames over the quarter. The bottom right panel shows the photometric aperture used in the Kepler PA and PDC light curve reduction, where only white pixels were counted and summed. Only the first plot, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 1</ref>.1, is shown in the text for guidance. Figures 1.1-1.76 are available in the online version of the Journal. We derived error estimates using three error analysis techniques implemented in JKTEBOP: Monte Carlo, Bootstrapping, and Residual Permutation, but chose to adopt the parameter errors estimated by this last technique as it has been shown to best account for the effect of systematic noise in transit light curves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jenkins et al. 2002)</ref>. While Monte Carlo and Bootstrapping tend to underestimate errors in the presence of systematic noise, those two techniques have traditionally been chosen over Residual Permutation because in the latter one can only refit the data as many times as available data points. This poses a problem for most ground based transit light curves, which typically have only a couple hundred points, but for Kepler Q2 data, which contains almost 5000 data points over a 90-day interval for the longcadence data, and nearly 30 times more for the shortcadence data, the method is not statistically limited and therefore best suited to derive robust errors.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> we plot the resulting phased light curves, with the corresponding best-fit model light curve when allowing eccentricity to vary, along with histograms of the parameter distributions from the error analysis, for the 40 modelable systems with Kepler PDC light curves. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> we do the same, but for the 50 modelable systems with CLM light curves. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 2</ref> we list the median values for all the modeling parameters, for both sets of light curves, and for both fixing e = 0 and allowing it to vary, along with their determined asymmetric, Gaussian, 1σ errors.</p><p>As a result of our light curve modeling we find, when fixing e = 0, 9 secondary eclipse detections at the 1-2σ level, 3 detections at the 2-3σ level and 4 detections at the &gt;3σ level in the PDC light curves. In the CLM light curves, we find 11 secondary eclipse detections at the 1-2σ level, 4 detections at the 2-3σ level and 4 detections at the &gt;3σ level. In the case of allowing eccentricity to vary we find 18 detections at 1-2σ level, 3 detections at 2-3σ level, and 4 detections at &gt;3σ level in the PDC light curves. In the CLM light curves we find 10 detections at 1-2σ level, 10 detections at 2-3σ level, and 5 detections at &gt;3σ level. Each set of results has been used independently in the statistical study of candidate emission parameters described in Sections 4 and 5. Examining both sets of light curves, and both e = 0 and e allowed to vary, we find 16 systems with 1-2σ, 14 systems with 2-3σ, and 6 systems with &gt;3σ confidence level secondary eclipse detections in at least one light curve. It is more difficult to quantify the number of systems that have certain level detections among multiple light curves and eccentricity constraints, given that not all systems had both PDC and CLM light curves and that eccentric systems may not be detected in the non-eccentric model, and is best left to the discussion of individual systems in §6. Additionally, examining the 35 systems that had both modelable PDC and CLM light curves, we find that for the PDC light curves the average reduced χ 2 value is 4.86, while for the CLM light curves it is 2.48, and that on average, each system's CLM light curve has a 27% lower reduced χ 2 value compared to the PDC light curve.</p><p>We also note that there were significant detections of negative J values for some systems. When fixing eccentricity to zero, for the PDC light curves, we find 3 detections of negative J at the 1-2σ level, but none at higher significance. In the CLM light curves, we find 4 detections of negative J at the 1-2σ level, but none at higher significance. In the case of allowing eccentricity to vary, for the PDC light curves, we find 4 detections of negative J at the 1-2σ level, and 1 detection at the 2-3σ level, but none at higher significance. In the CLM light curves we find 4 detections of negative J at the 1-2σ level, 1 detection at the 2-3σ level, and 1 detection at the &gt;3σ level. Since there is no known physical mechanism to increase the flux of the system when the planet passes behind the host star, these detections are obviously spurious. Since there is no bias towards or preference for positive or negative J values in the modeling code, and assuming that the Kepler data does not suffer from systematics that preferentially result in either decrements or increments in flux that span expected secondary eclipse durations, statistically speaking we must have as many false detections of positive J values, or secondary eclipses, for as many detections of negative J values we have, per each confidence interval. Thus, when fixing eccentricity to zero, for PDC light curves, we estimate our false alarm probabilities as 33% for 1-2σ detections, and 0% for &gt;2σ detections. For CLM light curves, we estimate a 36% false alarm probability for 1-2σ detections, and 0% for &gt;2σ detections. When allowing eccentricity to vary, for PDC light curves we estimate false alarm probabilities of 22% for 1-2σ detections, 33% for 2-3σ detections, and 0% for &gt;3σ detections. For the CLM light curves, we estimate a 40% false alarm probability for 1-2σ detections, 10% for 2-3σ detections, and 20% for &gt;3σ detections. Although we are dealing with small number statistics and the uncertainties on the determined false alarm probabilities are large, we note that these roughly agree with what we would statistically expect for each confidence interval quoted, i.e., a 1σ detection has a formal 31.73% false alarm probability by definition, though allowing eccentricity to vary does appear to induce false detections at ∼1.5 times greater frequency. Combining all the results from each light curve type and eccentricity parameter, we can generalize our false alarm probabilities to 31%, 10%, and 6% for the 1-2σ, 2-3σ, and &gt;3σ confidence intervals respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Stellar Parameters</head><p>The Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) provides estimates of the effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius for all the host stars in our sample. Those parameters have been derived from a combination of broad and narrowband photometry ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. 2011</ref>), although it has been also recognized that some of the parameter values in the KIC might contain significant errors. As explained in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>, the majority of approximately Sun-like stars in the KIC have effective temperatures that only disagree by 200 K or less from the temperature values of a control sample derived by other methods. However, for stars significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, i.e., with T ⋆ 9000 K and T ⋆ 4000 K, where T ⋆ is the effective temperature of the star, the temperatures in the KIC can suffer from large systematics and are not reliable. As well, in the case of the derived stellar radii, R ⋆ , the values reported in the KIC are derived from statistical relations between the values obtained for T ⋆ , the surface gravity of the stars, log g, and the luminosity, L ⋆ (see sections 7 and 8 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>, for more details). Therefore, if any of those parameters are systematically off, (such as log g, which has an associated error of ±0.4 dex), the values derived for R ⋆ will be erroneous.</p><p>All the host stars in our sample have KIC effective temperature estimates between 4000 and 9000 K, so we have assumed that those values are accurate within the errors. From those temperatures we recomputed the radius and mass of the stars via interpolation of up-to-date stellar evolutionary models by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bertelli et al.

In the error estimations using the KIC values, we assumed an error of ±0.4 dex for log g, as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>. In the error estimations using the model isochrones we assume an error of ±200 K for T ⋆ , as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. (2011)</ref>. The values for the mass and radius of each star as computed from the KIC, labeled "KIC", and via interpolation of the stellar isochrones, labeled "ISO", along with their estimated errors, are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Planetary Parameters</head><p>Given the stellar parameters and their associated errors, we proceeded with calculating physical parameters for each planet. From the orbital period of the system and the mass of the star, we calculated the semi-major axis of the planets via Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law. The radius of each planet, R p , was calculated from the stellar radius and the value of the radius ratio derived in §3. The obtained R p values are compared with those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Borucki et al. (2011)</ref> in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> by multiplying the derived value of the ratio of the radii from each study, including results from both the PDC and CLM data for ours, by the radius of the host star derived via both the KIC and stellar isochrones. Except for a handful of outliers, most values of the planetary radii derived via different parameter estimations seem to agree with the Borucki et al. (2011) results within ∼5%. We note though that the radii of individual planet candidates can be significantly affected depending on whether their stellar radii are derived from the KIC or stellar isochrones, on average ∼20%.</p><p>We also calculated the sub-stellar equilibrium temperature, maximum effective temperature, and brightness temperature of each planet following the same equations as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cowan &amp; Agol (2011)</ref>, who themselves draw upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hansen (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. (2008)</ref>. We calculated the equilibrium temperature of each planet at its substellar point, T 0 , using T ⋆ and the semi-major axis of the system, a, via,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T 0 = T ⋆ · (R ⋆ /a) 0.5<label>(2)</label></formula><p>We note that this expression assumes non-significant eccentricity effects on the heating of the planet by the star. We calculated the maximum effective temperature of the planet, T ǫ=0 , using the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T ǫ=0 = (2/3) 1 4 · T 0<label>(3)</label></formula><p>assuming no albedo or heat recirculation. Finally, to calculate the measured brightness temperature of each planet, T b , we assume both the planet and star emit like blackbodies and compute T b by integrating their fluxes over the Kepler passband from the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">J = t λ · λ −5 · (exp( hc λkT b ) − 1) −1 · dλ t λ · λ −5 · (exp( hc λkT⋆ ) − 1) −1 · dλ (4)</formula><p>where λ is a given wavelength, t λ is the net transmission of the telescope and detector at a given wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and k is Boltzmann's constant.</p><p>In the cases where significant sinusoidal variations were detected in the light curves, i.e., cases where we found a positive value for A Lp with a detection level of at least 2σ, we treated the effect as real and accounted for it in the determination of the day-side flux of the planet by multiplying the values of J in Eq. 4 by (1+A Lp ). The only systems where significant sinusoidal variations were detected are KOI 2.01 and KOI 13.01, for both the PDC and CLM data, and both fixing eccentricity to zero and letting it vary. For KOI 1541.01 a significant sinusoidal variation was also found, but only for the CLM data and when allowing eccentricity to vary. Notice that, if real, the observed amplitude of sinusoidal variations can be either due to a significant albedo, and thus a varying amount of reflected light with phase, a significant temperature difference between the day and night sides of the planets, i.e., very little heat redistribution, and therefore varying amounts of emitted light with phase, or photometric beaming. It is possible that sinusoidal systematic signals could mask as significant phase varia- tions, but in order to be detected as such by the residualpermutation error analysis we employed, the systematic feature would have to have a stable amplitude and period over the course of the 90-day observations, and have the period and phase of maximum amplitude coincide with the orbital period and secondary eclipse phase of the planet, which we deem unlikely.</p><p>In the above temperature calculations we have assumed no albedo and therefore all the observed planetary fluxes are due to thermal emission. However, the atmosphere of the planets can contain clouds or hazes which would reflect at least part of the incident stellar light. To account for those effects, we can estimate the different contribution amounts of reflected light to the measured planet-to-star surface brightness ratio, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F a = A · R 2 ⋆ a 2 (5)</formula><p>where A is the geometric albedo of the planet in the integrated Kepler passband. Assuming different values of A between 0.0 (no albedo) and 1.0 (purely reflective atmosphere), we can subtract the resultant value of F a from J in order to remove the reflected light contribution from the measurements of the eclipse depths before computing the T b of the planet that accounts for the remaining, thermally emitted, light. Furthermore, given the measured surface brightness ratio and Equation 5, we can determine the maximum possible geometric albedo of the planet in the Kepler wavelength range, A max , by assuming that all of the detected emission is solely due to reflected light. Setting F a = J and solving for A, we obtain the expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A max = a 2 J R 2 ⋆ (6)</formula><p>Finally, we have computed robust errors for all the derived quantities, i.e., T 0 , T ǫ=0 , T b , a, R p , A max , and also T b /T 0 (see next section) by re-calculating all their values 10,000 times, each time adding random Gaussian noise with amplitudes equal to the errors of the underlying quantities J, P , k, T * , M * , and R * . The resulting median values of each parameter and their asymmetric Gaussian 1σ errors are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 3</ref> along with the detection significance of the secondary eclipse, σ sec , and the luminosity ratio of the system, L r = L p /L ⋆ , for both the PDC and CLM light curves, both letting eccentricity vary and fixing it to zero, and both using the stellar parameters derived from the KIC and via stellar isochrones. Negative values of σ sec mean that a negative value of J was found, i.e., an increase of light at secondary eclipse, instead of the expected decrease. We deem those results unphysical, but note we can still use them to establish upper limits for the depth of the eclipse, and estimate the fraction of spurious eclipse detections in our analysis, as already described at the end of §3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECLIPSE EMISSIONS</head><p>Following Cowan &amp; Agol (2011), we plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> the dimensionless Kepler passband day-side brightness temperature ratio of each planet candidate in our sample, T b /T 0 , versus their maximum expected day-side temperature, T ǫ=0 , for the case of eccentricity fixed to zero. The different panels in the figure correspond to the results from the PDC and the CLM light curves, and both using the stellar parameters derived from the KIC and via stellar isochrones. In all the panels we have assumed zero albedo, which is equivalent to assuming that all the emission from the planet is thermal. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kipping &amp; Bakos 2011b), and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kepler-4b, Kepler-6b, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kepler-8b (Kipping &amp; Bakos 2011a)</ref>. Each point is shown with its 1σ x and y-axis errorbars, except for the &lt; 1σ detection upper limits, where the x-axis errorbars are omitted for clarity. Finally, the three horizontal lines in each plot indicate the expected values of T b /T 0 for no energy redistribution, i.e., f = 2/3, a uniform day-side temperature, i.e., f = 1/2, and a uniform planetary temperature, i.e., f = 1/4 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">López-Morales &amp; Seager 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cowan &amp; Agol 2011</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> we reproduce the same plots but with eccentricity allowed to vary.</p><p>Unless there is some extra emission at optical wavelengths that is not being accounted for, all the planets should lie below the f = 2/3 lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 5 and 6</ref>. However, it is immediately apparent that the vast majority of candidates lie above that line. In addition, there appears to be a trend of increasing T b /T 0 with decreasing T ǫ=0 , with some possible detections approaching 2.5 times the maximum expected brightness temperature, i.e., nearly 40 times more flux than expected. All the planets with previously published secondaries also appear to follow the same trend, although they all have T ǫ=0 2000 K. This trend will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p>We have explored several possible explanations for such large observed emissions at visible wavelengths: 1) A bias in the determination of stellar and planetary parameters or the secondary eclipse detection efficiency, 2) high albedos, which would make reflected light a major contributor to the planetary emission, 3) very large amounts of non-LTE or other thermal emission at optical wavelengths, 4) the presence of a significant source of internal energy generation within the planet, and 5) some of the candidates are in fact very low mass stars or brown dwarf companions, or background eclipsing binary blends.</p><p>Potential Biases: The determined stellar parameters of T ⋆ , M ⋆ , and R ⋆ can have significant uncertainties, as noted in §4, and indeed can vary notably when taken from the KIC or computed from stellar isochrones based on T ⋆ . The values of those parameters are intimately tied to the derivation of the planetary parameters T ǫ=0 , T 0 , T b , a, R p , F a , and A max , and that must be kept in mind when interpreting any possible results. For example, the stellar isochrones assume the stars are mainsequence, and thus if a host star is really a sub-giant or otherwise evolved, the stellar flux at the planet's surface would be underestimated. This would in turn cause an underestimated value of both T ǫ=0 and T 0 , and thus potentially overestimated values of T b /T 0 at lower T ǫ=0 . However, it is unlikely that a large fraction of the examined systems are significantly evolved, and sub-giants would likely show telltale variations in their light curves. Given this, and that as far as we know there is no other preferential bias in the determination of the stellar parameters, we would not expect this problem to systematically influence the results presented in Figures 5 and 6.</p><p>When examining secondary detection efficiency, we note that the derived upper limits on the secondary eclipse depths are roughly at the same level as the noise of the Kepler data. That level of noise is consistent among the set of Kepler light curves we have examined. Thus, as we search the data for planets with lower values of T ǫ=0 and T 0 , the corresponding upper limit for T b /T 0 naturally increases, as the expected eclipse depth decreases while the noise level remains the same. This introduces an artificial trend of higher T b /T 0 upper limits as T ǫ=0 decreases, which can be seen in Figures 5 and 6. Similarly, when examining the ∼1σ detections, about ∼32% of the detections will be statistically spurious, as exemplified in the data and already discussed in §3. We thus expect an artificial trend of higher T b /T 0 values with decreasing values of T ǫ=0 for ∼32% of the ∼1σ detections. However, when we move to the 2σ detections, the expected rate of spurious detections drop to 5-10%. The data in Figures 5 and 6 still reveal a significant trend of increasing T b /T 0 values with decreasing T ǫ=0 in the 2σ detections, (including as well previous secondary eclipse detections from the literature), so we conclude this trend is real and due to either increasing albedos or emission features in the visible as the atmospheric temperature of the planets decrease. The hypothesis of high albedos is further discussed below. As for emission features, a literature search on this topic does not reveal any known physical processes that would produce this effect, so further theoretical work might be necessary.</p><p>High Albedos: As mentioned in the introduction, some recent studies suggest high albedos for some known hot giant planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berdyugina et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kipping &amp; Bakos 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Demory et al. 2011</ref>). To examine the possibility that the excess flux observed in our list of secondary eclipse candidates is due to albedo, we have recomputed the expected normalized brightness temperature T b /T 0 of each candidate when assuming increasing values of the albedo. The reflected light contribution is computed using equation 5 and subtracted from the total flux measured for each object. T b is then recomputed using the remaining flux, assuming it is solely due to thermal emission. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> for three different albedos, A = 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0, using the secondary eclipse depths measured from the CLM pipeline light curves for e = 0, (the eclipse depths measured from the other light curves described in §2 give similar results).</p><p>As expected, T b /T 0 decreases as the albedo increases, and many of the points in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> go below the T b /T 0 = (2/3) 1/4 , i.e., A =0 and f = 2/3, limit once high enough albedos are assumed. The emission of 53% of the planet candidates can be interpreted as a combination of reflected light and thermal emission when we assume a geometric albedo of A = 0.5, set e = 0, and derive stellar parameters from the KIC, though only 31% when deriving stellar parameters from stellar isochrones. Those levels of reflectivity might indicate the presence of clouds, haze, or Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of those planets, with a general trend of increasing albedo with decreasing planetary temperature responsible for the trend of increasingly excess emission at lower planetary temperatures. We note, however, that a significant number of points, 40% and 63% when deriving stellar parameters from the KIC and stellar isochrones respectively, with e = 0, still remain above T b /T 0 = (2/3) 1/4 , even if we assume perfectly reflecting planets, i.e. A = 1.0. Many of these remaining systems are at low values of T ǫ=0 , and some of those points are 2σ detections, so there is still excess emission and a correlation of T b /T 0 with decreasing T ǫ=0 that cannot be explained by reflected light, and needs to be explained in some other way. Non-LTE or Other Thermal Emission: We have used the brightness temperature parameter T b to represent the amount of thermal emission from each planet, assuming that the planets emit as blackbodies. In that case, if the emission of the planet yields a T b larger than that predicted by f = 2/3 and A = 0, that emission is above the so-called equilibrium temperature. However, the atmospheres of exoplanets do not necessarily emit as blackbodies, and some spectral models of hot Jupiters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. 2008</ref>) predict significantly higher emission levels in the optical region covered by the Kepler bandpass (∼ 0.4 -0.9 µm) compared to blackbody approximations. The emission spectrum of a planet will depend strongly on its atmospheric composition and Temperature-Pressure (T-P) profile. Although some models including the presence of strong absorbers, such as TiO and VO, have been proposed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hubeny et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burrows et al. 2008</ref>), uncertainties in the T-P profiles and the lack of previous observational data limit the reliability of those models. In addition, and as already mentioned above, there is currently no model that predicts the increase of T b /T 0 for decreasing T ǫ=0 observed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 5 and 6</ref>.</p><p>Another possibility is that the large amount of stellar irradiation these planets receive induces resonant and non-resonant fluorescent transitions by exciting the chemical species present in their upper atmospheres. Fluorescence has been measured in Solar System objects, i.e., Titan, Saturn and Jupiter, at IR, UV, and X-ray wavelengths (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Yelle &amp; Griffith 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">López-Valverde et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cravens et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lupu et al. 2011</ref>), and possibly in the NIR for the exoplanet HD189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Swain et al. 2010</ref>), but we could not find any observations of or theoretical work on non-LTE/fluorescence emission in the 0.4 -0.9µm wavelength range covered by Kepler. However, it is expected that non-LTE emission lines in exoplanetary atmospheres will not be significantly broadened by collisions, and will appear instead as sharp emission features <ref type="bibr">(Martin-Torres, priv. comm.)</ref>. Considering the amount of energy required to produce these fluorescent emissions, it is unlikely that, given their narrow emission range, they would be luminous enough to significantly increase the mea-  Significant Internal Energy Generation: Our own Jupiter radiates about 1.6 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. The additional heat source is generally attributed to either residual heat left over from the initial Solar System nebula collapse, or ongoing slow contraction of the planet's core. However, if the planet candidates in our list were undergoing a similar internal energy generation process, T b /T 0 would only reach up to about 1.6 1/4 = 1.12, not high enough to explain the emission of objects in our sample with T ǫ=0 1500 K.</p><p>Low Mass Stars, Brown Dwarfs, or Blends: The last possibility we consider is that some of the objects in the list are in fact brown-dwarfs or low-mass stars, but this assumption also posses some problems. Exoplanet search results over the years have revealed what appears to be a "brown dwarf desert" within orbital separations from the host star of a 5 AU, for solar type stars (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grether &amp; Lineweaver 2006</ref>). However, the discovery of CoRoT-3b, a 21.7 M Jup object orbiting at a separation of only 0.057 AU around an F3-type star, has opened some debate about whether this object is really a brown dwarf, or if planets more massive than the defined Deuterium burning limit can form around stars more massive than the Sun. To test this idea we plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> the measured T b /T 0 of each planet candidate versus the effective temperature of the star, T ⋆ . We see, however, no clear correlation between the temperature of the host star and an excess brightness of the planet candidates, and an error-weighted linear fit does not yield a statistically significant slope. We also plot in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> the values for T b /T 0 versus R p , a, and A Lp , but do not see any significant linear correlations either.</p><p>We also utilize the upper limits on possible secondary eclipses we derived to examine potential trends in A max as computed using Eq. 6. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref> we plot both the 1σ and 3σ upper limits, delineated by solid and dashed lines respectively, on the values of A max versus T ǫ=0 for both fixing eccentricity to zero and allowing it to vary, for the CLM light curves and deriving stellar parameters from isochrones.

Upon inspection of the data, it turns out that we are not able to significantly constrain the albedo, when both Kipping &amp; Bakos (2011a) and Demory et al.

Unfortunately the KIC did not hint at this star being non-main-sequence, and the stellar isochrones we employ assume the host star is on the main-sequence. Obviously changing the stellar radius by a factor of ∼2 greatly impacts the estimate of reflected light, and this should emphasize the connection between the assumed stellar properties and derived planetary properties. Although we do not detect significant phase variations, our obtained values for the PDC light curve are not in conflict with either previously published result at greater than ∼1σ significance. The value for the CLM light curve does conflict at &gt;3σ significance, and we attribute it to differences in the light curve processing from the pixel level data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have analyzed the Kepler Q2 light curves of 76 hot Jupiter transiting planet candidates using both the Kepler PDC data and the results from our own photometric pipeline for producing light curves from the pixellevel data. Of the 76 initial candidates only 55 have light curves with high enough photometric stability to search for secondary eclipses. For the remaining targets this search is hindered by either intrinsic variability of the host star or residual systematics in the light curve analyses. We have found that significant systematics in the Kepler light curves due to small photometric apertures and large centroid motions hinder analyses if not properly removed or accounted for, and that a re-reduction of the photometry is best done at the pixel-stamp level. We also stress the importance of taking into account how</p><p>Kepler light curves are produced from the pixel level data when considering any detection of low-frequency signals, as they can vary significantly depending on the technique employed.</p><p>We have also re-determined the stellar and planetary parameters of each system while deriving robust errors that take into account residual systematic noise in the light curves. We detect what appear to be the secondary eclipse signals of ∼20-30 of the targets in our list at &gt; 1σ confidence levels, and also derive robust upper limits for the secondary eclipse emission of all the remaining objects in our sample. All of our sample present excess emission compared to what is expected via blackbody thermal emission alone, as well as a trend of increasing excess emission with decreasing expected maximum effective planetary temperature, in agreement with previously reported secondary eclipse detections of hot Jupiters in the optical, which can be attributed to the 'appearance' of increasing albedos with decreasing planetary temperatures. By performing statistical analyses of those results we arrive to the following main conclusions.</p><p>1. Assuming no contribution from reflected light, i.e., A = 0.0, the majority of the detected secondary eclipses reveal thermal emission levels higher than the maximum emission levels expected for planets in local thermodynamical equilibrium.</p><p>2. While the extra emission from many of the planets can be accounted for by varying the amount of reflected light, the emission from ∼50% of the detected objects (&gt;1σ) can not be accounted for even when assuming perfectly reflective planets (i.e., A = 1.0). These planets must either have much higher thermal emission in the optical compared to a blackbody, as predicted by theoretical models, have very large non-LTE optical emission features, have underestimated host star masses, radii, or effective temperatures, or are in fact false-positives and not planets but rather brown dwarfs, very lowmass stars, or stellar blends. Follow-up observations of these systems are necessary to confirm this conclusion. 4. From the emission upper limits placed on planet candidates for which we do not detect secondary eclipse signals, we conclude that a significant number, at least 30% at the 1σ level, of those targets must have very low-albedos, (A g &lt; 0.3), which is a result that is consistent with the majority of previous observations and early theoretical hot Jupiter model predictions. All previous observational upper limits had been placed on hot Jupiters with expected atmospheric effective temperatures higher than ∼1650 K. Our results extend that temperature limit to planets with expected effective temperatures higher than 1200 K and can help further establish what chemicals place a critical role in the atmospheric properties of hot Jupiters.</p><p>5. From the inspection of individual targets we conclude that the majority of our secondary eclipse depths for candidates with previously published eclipse detections are consistent with the results from those other studies. We note that several of those other studies have access to Kepler data from quarters after Q2, while our analysis is limited to just the public Q2 data, and therefore our results have larger detection errorbars in some cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Our results are based on only one quarter of Kepler</head><p>data, but 12-24 quarters should become available in the future. Therefore, we expect that future studies of these targets will be able to improve our secondary eclipse detections and upper limits by factors of 3-5, or much greater if noise systematics in the light curves can be further reduced.</p><p>We first and foremost thank the entire Kepler team and all those who have contributed to the Kepler Mission, without which this paper would not be possible.

Similar to Figure 5, but with eccentricity allowed to vary. sured emission levels over the very wide Kepler bandpass above the expected LTE emissions observed in Figures 5 and 6. Significant Internal Energy Generation: Our own Jupiter radiates about 1.6 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. The additional heat source is generally attributed to either residual heat left over from the initial Solar System nebula collapse, or ongoing slow contraction of the planet's core. However, if the planet candidates in our list were undergoing a similar internal energy generation process, T b /T 0 would only reach up to about 1.6 1/4 = 1.12, not high enough to explain the emission of objects in our sample with T ǫ=0 1500 K. Low Mass Stars, Brown Dwarfs, or Blends: The last possibility we consider is that some of the objects in the list are in fact brown-dwarfs or low-mass stars, but this assumption also posses some problems. Exoplanet search results over the years have revealed what appears to be a "brown dwarf desert" within orbital separations from the host star of a 5 AU, for solar type stars (see e.g., Grether &amp; Lineweaver 2006). However, the discovery of CoRoT-3b, a 21.7 M Jup object orbiting at a separation of only 0.057 AU around an F3-type star, has opened some debate about whether this object is really a brown dwarf, or if planets more massive than the defined Deuterium burning limit can form around stars more massive</figDesc></figure>
