			<abstract>
				<p>As most exoplanets host stars, HD 160691 (alias µ Ara) presents a metallicity excess in its spectrum compared to stars without detected planets. This excess may be primordial, in which case the star would be completely over-metallic, or it may be due to accretion in the early phases of planetary formation, in which case it would be overmetallic only in its outer layers. As discussed in a previous paper (Bazot and Vauclair 2004), seismology can help choosing between the two scenarios. This star was observed during eight nights with the spectro-graph HARPS at La Silla Observatory. Forty three p-modes have been identified (Bouchy et al. 2005). In the present paper, we discuss the modelisation of this star. We computed stellar models iterated to present the same observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical composition) while the internal structure was different according to the two extreme assumptions : original overmetallicity or accretion. We show that in any case the seismic constraints lead to models in complete agreement with the external parameters deduced from spectroscopy and from the Hipparcos parallax (L and T eff). We discuss the tests which may lead to a choice between the two typical scenarios. We show that the &quot;small separation&quot; seem to give a better fit for the accretion case than for the overmetallic case, but in spite of the very good data the uncertainties are still too large to conclude. We discuss the observations which would be needed to go further and solve this question. 2 Bazot et al.: Asteroseismology of µ Arae</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the first discovery of a planet orbiting around Peg 51 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mayor et al. 1995</ref>), more than 130 exoplanets have been detected 1 . The central stars of these planetary systems appear to be overmetallic compared to the Sun, at least in their atmospheres. Their average metallicity is ∼ 0.2 dex larger than solar while it is about solar for stars which have no detected planets, in the solar neighborhood ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gonzalez et al. 1998</ref>). Two scenarios have been proposed to explain these high metallicities. In the first scenario, they are the result of a high initial metal content in the proto-stellar gas : in a metal-rich environment the mechanisms leading to planet formation are more efficient, which would explain the observed bias. In the second scenario, the overmetallicity is due to the accretion of hydrogen-poor matter during planetary formation. This matter could come from already formed planets which migrate to wards the central star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Trilling et al. 1998</ref>) and eventually fall on it ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Murray et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">, Murray &amp; Chaboyer 2002</ref>. This process leads to a metal excess in the stellar outer layers only (as it is diluted in the surface convective zone), while the former scenario implies that planet-hosting stars are completely overmetallic, down to their centers. <ref type="bibr">Bazot &amp; Vauclair (2004, hereafter BV04</ref>) studied the internal differences of stellar models computed with either the overmetallic or the accretion assumption, but iterated so as to present exactly the same observable parameters (T eff , L L⊙ , Z) : these models can account for the same observed star, but their interiors are different. Moreover, they have slightly different masses (up to 20%) while their observed parameters are the same.</p><p>BV04 studied the asteroseismic signatures of these internal differences. They focused on the fact that something special occurs for stars with masses around 1.1 M ⊙ , as convective cores begin to develop. This is a delicate and metallicity-dependent process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Michaud et al. 2004</ref>). Indeed, it is possible that among two models representing the same observed star, one has a convective core while the other does not.</p><p>We decided to test these preliminary investigations with the star µ Ara (HD160691, HR6585, GJ691). It is a G3IV-V star with a visual magnitude V=5.1. We obtained 8 nights in June 2004 to observe this star with the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6-m telescope in La Silla. We first reported on a discovery of a new low-mass planet around this star, of ∼14 earth masses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Santos et al. 2004b</ref> are given in dex. The references for the given values are given in column 3, they are followed by † for spectrometric measurements and ‡ for photometric measurements. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observational constraints</head><p>With a visual magnitude of V=5.1 and a Hipparcos parallax of π=65.5±0.8 mas, the star µ Ara has an absolute magnitude M V =4.20 and a luminosity of log L/L ⊙ =0.28±0.012.</p><p>The different values given in the literature for its effective temperature are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The HARPS spectrum obtained during our run (see below) was used to derive a new spectroscopic set of atmospheric parameters. From this study the values T eff =5813±40 K and [Fe/H]=0.32±0.05 dex were found (second line of <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). With such a metallicity, µ Ara happens to be one of the most metallic planet-hosting star (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Santos et al. 2003</ref>). As we can see in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> there is a discrepancy in effective temperature between the two oldest measurements (bottom lines) and the most recent ones which are in good agreement, around 5800 K. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 1 and 2</ref>, the five most recent measurements are displayed. We will see below that seismic studies of this star lead to more precise constraints on T eff , inside the error bars given by these spectroscopic values.</p><p>We also notice that they are in good agreement with the newest effective temperatures, which are believed to be more precise than the oldest ones. The two lowest values given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for T eff are ruled out by our results.</p><p>We observed µ Ara with the high-precision echelle spectrograph HARPS available on the 3.6-m ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile. As discussed in details in paper I, 43</p><p>low degree p-modes with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 2.5 were identified. The degrees of the observed modes range from l=0 to l=3. The uncertainty on each mode frequency is 0.78 µHz due to the duration of the time series. The eigenfrequencies for these p-modes are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Echelle diagrams</head><p>We computed series of "overmetallic" and "accretion" models which could account for the observed parameters of µ Ara. We used the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, with the OPAL equation of state and opacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Rogers &amp; Nayfonov 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">, Iglesias &amp; Rogers 1996</ref>) and the NACRE nuclear reaction rates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angulo et al. 1999</ref>). In all our models, microscopic diffusion was included using the Paquette prescription ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Paquette et al. 1986</ref>). The treatment of convection was done in the framework of the mixing length theory and the mixing length parameter was adjusted as in the Sun (α = 1.8, Richard 1998, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Richard et al. 2004</ref>).The accretion models were computed with the same assumptions as in BV04 (instantaneous fall of matter at the beginning of the main sequence and instantaneous mixing inside the convection zone). Neither extramixing nor overshoot were taken in account in the present computations (this will be done in future work).</p><p>Adiabatic oscillations frequencies were computed for a large number of models along the evolutionary tracks, using a recent version of the <ref type="bibr">Brassard et al. (1992)</ref> code, as in BV04. In order to compare them with the modes observed in µ Ara, the frequencies were computed for angular degrees l=0 to l=3 and radial orders ranging typically from 4 to 100. The azimuthal order is always m=0. For each evolutionary track, we focused on the models which fell inside the observed box in the HR diagram (cf <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 1 and 2</ref>), namely models with luminosities and effective temperatures as given by spectroscopy. We then searched for those models, among the previous ones, which could precisely reproduce the observed echelle diagram.   for the accretion case in the same way as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> for the overmetallic case.</p><p>We present here two models which, given our basic assumptions, fit reasonably well the observed frequencies and echelle diagram. We computed a reduced χ 2 for both cases.</p><p>The echelle diagrams are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 3 and 4</ref>, respectively for the overmetallic and the accretion cases. These models correspond to the crosses in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 1 and 2</ref>.</p><p>Their characteristics are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> From spectroscopy and photometry both stars would appear nearly identical, within the Open squares, full squares, open triangles and full triangles stand for l=0, l=1, l=2, l=3, respectively. Their size is proportionnal to the signal to noise ratio (see Paper I).</p><p>observational uncertainties, but their internal structures are quite different. The most striking fact is the presence of a convective core in the overmetallic model, with a radius of ∼ 0.07 R ⋆ (R ⋆ being the radius of the star).</p><p>The accretion scenario, with χ2 = 4.3, provides a better match for the observations than the overmetallic model, for which we obtained χ2 = 7.6. We must however keep in mind that these values are still high : it is not possible to give a clear conclusion at the present stage. We discuss below other possible seismic tests.</p><p>Among these frequencies, we note that the lowest one is particularly interesting. It has been identified as a l=2 mode (see Paper I). It is in good agreement with the accretion model. However, the overmetallic model gives a slightly better fit if we consider it as being </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Small separations</head><p>We compared the measured small separations, δν = δν n,l − ν n−1,l+2 , with the computed ones. As this quantity is very sensitive to the deep stellar interior ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Tassoul 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov 1994</ref>, it was proposed in BV04 as a good indicator of the presence of a convective core in stars around 1.1 M ⊙ .</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Roxburgh and Vorontsov (1994)</ref>, the presence of a convective core leads to an oscillatory signal in the small separations with a period scaling approximately as ∼ 1/2t cc , where t cc is the acoustic radius of the convective core (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>).  accretion cases for the l = 0, 2 small separations. In the overmetallic case they rapidly decrease at large frequencies and even become negative at some point, while in the accretion case the curve is much flatter. This behavior has to be related to the echelle diagrams : for the overmetallic case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3)</ref>, the theoretical lines for l = 0 and l = 2 cross around ν = 2.7 mHz, which does not happen for the accretion case. Such a crossing is in contradiction with the asymptotic theory which may be a good representation of seismology in a radiative interior but does not hold in the presence of a convective core.</p><p>It assumes in particular that the sound velocities at the turning points of the waves are identical to the central sound velocity, which is not true in this case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Figure 8)</ref>. A complete discussion of the signatures of convective cores will be given in a forthcoming</p><p>paper. Here we only compare the observed and predicted small separations in the star µ</p><p>Ara. We also computed a reduced χ2 for the small separations. We obtained χ2 = 1.2 for model AC and χ2 = 2.2 for model OM. These results are better than those resulting from the fits of the frequencies (echelle diagrams). This is partly due to the fact that the uncertainties on small separations are √ 2 times larger than for individual frequencies.</p><p>But there is also a physical reason for this better fit : the small separations are believed to be independent of the surface effects which affect the individual frequencies (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gabriel 1989</ref>). These effects, which are difficult to estimate, may deteriorate the quality of the fit of individual frequencies while they have no influence on small separations.</p><p>The fact that model AC better matches the observations than model OM has to be considered cautiously. We can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 6</ref> that the decrease of the theoretical small separations due to the convective core, in model OM, becomes more important at high frequencies : this effect, which is crucial for the choice between models, corresponds to the beginning of the oscillations that we have discussed above. However, the three values that we obtain for the highest observed frequencies involve modes with a signal to noise ratio between 2.5 and 3 (small dots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figs 6 and 7)</ref>. We cannot exclude misidentifications of these modes. In such a case the corresponding small separations would be different and the agreement between the observations and model OM could become comparable</p><p>to the one with model AC. represented as a solid curve for l=0-2 and a dotted curve for l=1-3.</p><p>More observations are needed to reach a clear conclusion. It would be particularly important in this framework to detect modes with large frequencies, even larger than in the present work, and with the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio, to be able to distinguish clearly between the two scenarios.  or OM except that we imposed a small mixing-length or initial helium mass fraction variation (only one at the time). We then selected, for given physics (i.e. accretion or overmetallicity and a given set of parameters (α, Y 0 )), the age for which the average large separation is 90 µHz.</p></div>

In contrast, variations in ∆ν 0 are much more significant and do not agree with the seismical constraints in case of a mass change of the order of 1%.</p><p>It thus gives an upper limit of 0.01 M ⊙ for the precision obtained with asteroseismology on the mass of the star.</p><p>In case of an age shift of ± 100 Myr, the resulting models have average large separations corresponding to the limit values we used. Consequently, we expect, for given physics, an accuracy of the order of 100 Myr on the age of the star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and conclusions.</head><p>For the first time stellar oscillations have been detected and an asteroseismic analysis has been performed for a planet-hosting star. With a magnitude V=5.1, µ Ara also represents the faintest solar-like star with detected p-modes. The observing run was a real success, as 43 modes could be identified, leading to a clear echelle diagram with large separations of 90 µHz. Note that we also discovered during this run the smallest exoplanet ever observed, with a mass of 14 earth masses.</p><p>The seismic analysis of this star leads to precise constraints on its position in the HR diagram, inside the observational box obtained from spectroscopy and the Hipparcos parallax.</p><p>The ultimate aim of this run was to try to determine whether the star is completely overmetallic or only in its outer layers. In the first case it would suggest that the star and its planets formed out of an interstellar nebula which was already metal rich, while in the second case it would mean that accretion at the beginning of planetary formation was much more active than generally thought.</p><p>We found an interesting test to decide between these two fundamental scenarios : the overmetallic models which can account for the observable parameters of the star have a convective core while the accretion models do not. We chose two of these models to go further in the analysis, by comparing the large and the small separations. We found that the presence of the convective core in the overmetallic model presented a signature in its deviations to the asymptotic theory : the lines l = 0 and l = 2 cross in the echelle diagram, which does not happen in the accretion model.</p><p>Unfortunately this signature clearly appears around frequencies of 2.5 mHz which correspond to the highest frequency we were able to detect. At first sight, the graphs which display the observed and computed small separations ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figures 6 and 7</ref>) seem in favor of the accretion scenario, but we definitely need more observations to go further.</p><p>It would be necessary to increase the signal to noise ratio for frequencies around 2.5 to 2.7 mHz, which lie in the crucial region where the small separations for the overmetallic and the accretion models clearly diverge.</p><p>In spite of a large amount of observational constraints on the bright star µ Ara, we</p><p>were not able to find a unique solution for the mass of the star and propose two possible masses which differ by more than 10%. Further additional Doppler observations, in mono or multi-sites, will not easily resolve the question. In the frequency range we are trying to reach, p-mode amplitudes are lower than 10 cm.s −1 and we can suspect that, due to their short life time, it will be very difficult to extract them from granulation noise. Future interferometric determinations of the radius of µ Ara could help choosing one of the two scenarios, in case it can reach an accuracy better than 1%. Our analysis clearly illustrates the difficulties of characterizing the internal structure of stars even with a large number of identified p-modes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>of Paper I. The average separation between modes of consecutive order is ∆ν 0 = 90 µHz (see paper I). It should be noted that in the further analysis we adopt a conservative point of view. Because of the different confidence levels we have on the observed frequencies (see paper I for a complete discussion), and thus on the individual large separations, we defined the region of seismic constraint as the area delimited by the iso-∆ν 0 89 µHz and 91 µHz (see Figs. 1 and 2) The echelle diagram for the observed frequencies is shown in both Figures 3 and 4.

The changes we imposed on the mixing-length parameter and on the initial helium mass fraction correspond respectively to 3% and 4% of the initials values used in AC and OM. In fact, variations in Y 0 with such an amplitude are ruled out because the resulting position of the star in the HR diagram would not account for the spectroscopic</figDesc></figure>

The feature in the central region for the OM case compared to the AC case is due to the convective core. The sound velocity drops dramatically at its boundary and goes up again inside. The frequencies of the modes l = 0 which progress down to the stellar center are affected by this behavior while those for which the turning point lie outside this region are not. This explains the special behavior of the corresponding lines in the echelle diagram also seen in the small separations.</figDesc></figure>
