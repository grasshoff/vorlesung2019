				<p>THE SEARCH FOR EXOMOONS AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES by Giammarco Campanella Since planets were first discovered outside our own Solar System in 1992 (around a pulsar) and in 1995 (around a main sequence star), extrasolar planet studies have become one of the most dynamic research fields in astronomy. Our knowledge of extrasolar planets has grown exponentially, from our understanding of their formation and evolution to the development of different methods to detect them. Now that more than 370 exoplanets have been discovered, focus has moved from finding planets to characterise these alien worlds. As well as detecting the atmospheres of these exoplanets, part of the characterisation process undoubtedly involves the search for extrasolar moons. The structure of the thesis is as follows. In Chapter 1 an historical background is provided and some general aspects about ongoing situation in the research field of extrasolar planets are shown. In Chapter 2, various detection techniques such as radial velocity, microlensing, astrometry, circumstellar disks, pulsar timing and magnetospheric emission are described. A special emphasis is given to the transit photometry technique and to the two already operational transit space missions, CoRoT and Kepler. A review on the current situation of exoplanet characterization is presented in Chapter 3. We focus on the characterization of transiting planets orbiting very close to their parent star since for them we can already probe their atmospheric constituents. By contrast, the second part of the Chapter is dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life, both within and beyond the Solar System. The characteristics of the Habitable Zone and the markers for the presence of life (biosignatures) are detailed. In Chapter 4 we describe the primary transit observations of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b we obtained at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 μm using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detail the procedures we adopted to correct for the systematic trends present in IRAC data. The lightcurves were fitted, taking into account limb darkening effects, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and prayer-bead Monte Carlo techniques. We obtained the following depth measurements: at 3.6 μm, 1.469±0.013 % and 1.448±0.013 %; at 4.5 μm, 1.478±0.017 %; at 5.8 μm, 1.549±0.015 % and at 8.0 μm 1.535±0.011 %. Our results indicate the presence of water in the planetary atmosphere. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the search for exomoons, we review some of the proposed detection techniques and introduce a model for the TTV and TDV signals which permits not only the identification of exomoons but also the derivation of some of their characteristics. We find that these techniques could easily detect Earth-mass exomoons with current instruments. Finally, in Chapter 6 the detectability of a habitable-zone exomoon around various configurations of exoplanetary systems with the Kepler Mission or photometry of approximately equal quality is investigated. We calculate both the predicted transit timing signal amplitudes and the estimated uncertainty on such measurements in order to calculate the confidence in detecting such bodies across a broad spectrum of orbital arrangements. The effects of photon noise, stellar variability and instrument noise are all accounted for in the analysis. We validate our methodology by simulating synthetic lightcurves and we find that habitable-zone exomoons down to 0.2M⊕ may be detected and ∼ 25,000 stars could be surveyed for habitable-zone exomoons within Kepler &apos;s field-of-view. Università degli Studi di Roma-La Sapienza‖ Riassunto THE SEARCH FOR EXOMOONS AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES di Giammarco Campanella Partendo da quando vennero scoperti per la prima volta alcuni pianeti esterni al Sistema Solare nel 1992 (attorno ad una pulsar) e nel 1995 (attorno ad una stella di Sequenza Principale), gli studi inerenti ai pianeti extrasolari sono divenuti uno dei campi di ricerca astronomica più dinamici. Negli anni, la nostra conoscenza dei pianeti extrasolari è cresciuta immensamente: si va dalla comprensione dei loro meccanismi di formazione ed evoluzione, allo sviluppo di diversi metodi per rivelarli. Ora che più di 370 esopianeti sono stati scoperti, l&apos;interesse si è spostato dal trovare i pianeti al caratterizzare questi mondi alieni. Oltre ad investigare le atmosfere di questi pianeti, parte del processo di caratterizzazione riguarda indubbiamente la ricerca delle esolune, i satelliti naturali che orbitano attorno ai pianeti extrasolari. La struttura della tesi è la seguente. Nel Capitolo 1 viene fornito un quadro storico relativo all&apos;argomento oggetto della tesi e viene presentata la situazione attuale del campo di ricerca dei pianeti extrasolari. Nel Capitolo 2 vengono descritti alcuni metodi utilizzati per l&apos;individuazione degli esopianeti: la velocità radiale, le microlenti gravitazionali, l&apos;astrometria, i dischi circumstellari, le variazioni degli intervalli di emissioni di una Pulsar e le emissioni magnetosferiche. Inoltre, si illustra con una speciale attenzione la tecnica della fotometria di transito e si presentano le due missioni spaziali già operative nell&apos;ambito: CoRoT e Kepler. Nel Capitolo 3 viene tracciata la situazione attuale della caratterizzazione degli esopianeti. Si dedica una particolare attenzione a quei pianeti che transitano davanti alla propria stella e che si trovano molto vicino ad essa perché per loro è già possibile sondare la loro costituzione atmosferica. La seconda parte del Capitolo è invece dedicata alla ricerca della vita extraterrestre, riferita sia all&apos;interno che all&apos;esterno del Sistema Solare. Tra l&apos;altro poi vengono illustrate le singolarità della zona abitabile e le caratteristiche spettrali riconducibili proprio all&apos;attività biologica. Il Capitolo 4 è incentrato sulla descrizione di un progetto di ricerca inerente all&apos;osservazione a 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 e 8.0 μm di alcuni transiti di HD 209458b rilevati utilizzando la camera ad infrarossi IRAC del Telescopio Spaziale Spitzer. Vengono presentate in dettaglio le procedure adottate per correggere le tendenze sistematiche presenti nei dati di IRAC. Le curve di luce sono state quindi fittate, tenendo conto dell&apos;oscuramento al bordo, con le tecniche Monte Carlo-Markov Chain‖ e-Prayer-Bead‖. Si sono ottenute le seguenti misure di profondità di transito: a 3.6 μm, 1.469±0.013 % e 1.448±0.013 %; a 4.5 μm, 1.478±0.017 %; a 5.8 μm, 1.549±0.015 % e a 8.0 μm 1.535±0.011 %. I nostri risultati indicano la presenza di acqua nell&apos;atmosfera del pianeta. Il Capitolo 5 è dedicato alla ricerca delle esolune, vengono esaminate prima alcune tecniche di rivelamento proposte e poi si introduce un modello che descrive le variazioni temporali e di durata del transito (TTV/TDV). Questo modello, oltre a permettere l&apos;identificazione delle esolune, dà la possibilità di derivare alcune delle sue caratteristiche. Si trova che con queste tecniche si potrebbe già rivelare con la strumentazione attualmente disponibile una esoluna di massa pari a quella terrestre. Infine, nel Capitolo 6 viene investigata la possibilità di rivelare esolune in orbita nella zona abitabile di un ampio numero di configurazioni di sistemi esoplanetari tramite Kepler o fotometria di qualità approssimativamente uguale. Abbiamo calcolato le ampiezze previste dei segnali TTV/TDV e anche le incertezze stimate su queste misure. Cosi è stato possibile calcolare la confidenza che si può raggiungere nel rilevare questi corpi, spaziando un ampio spettro di assetti orbitali. Durante questa analisi sono stati considerati tutti gli effetti derivanti dal rumore fotonico, la variabilità stellare e il rumore strumentale. Abbiamo validato la nostra metodologia simulando curve di luce sintetiche e siamo arrivati alla conclusione che possono essere rivelate esolune nella zona abitabile fino ad un minimo di 0.2M⊕ e che ∼ 25000 stelle nel campo di vista di Kepler offrono le condizioni per rilevare esolune in orbita nella zona abitabile. i CONTENTS</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C h a p t e r 2</head><p>EXTRASOLAR PLANET DETECTION METHODS Extrasolar planets are incredibly difficult to detect. This is because any planet is an extremely faint light source compared to its parent star. For this reason, only few extrasolar planets have been observed directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Instead, indirect methods have to be resorted to find extrasolar planets. Here we present seven different indirect techniques that are currently used: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Magnetospheric Emission</head><p>Many of these methods rely on the measure of the interaction between the exoplanet and its parent star. By observing changes in the parent star, the existence of the planet can be deduced. Since the changes become larger as the planet becomes more massive, it is always easier to detect Jovian planets rather than terrestrial ones. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref>.1: Basic quantities for planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sun</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Radial Velocity</head><p>Radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring a parent star's periodic line of sight velocity change due to its orbit around a common centre of mass, using the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines.</p><p>Beginning with the detection of a planet half the mass of Jupiter around 51 Pegasi, by</p><p>Meyor &amp; Queloz in 1995, the Doppler spectroscopy technique has been the most successful so far in finding extrasolar planets. In fact, this method is responsible for the initial detection of over 80% of the exoplanets known today. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.1: Schematic view of the wobble of a star due to an orbiting planet as observed from Earth. The star moves around the barycentre of the planetary system and its spectrum appears blue-shifted as it approaches the observer and red-shifted when it moves away.</p><p>The semi-amplitude of the stellar radial velocity signal K resulting from an exoplanetary system is given by <ref type="bibr">(2.1)</ref> where M p is in Jupiter masses, M * is in solar masses, P is in years, and the orbit is assumed to be circular. From this equation, we see immediately that radial velocity detection gives the largest signal for massive planets in short period orbits. For instance, 51 Peg has a 4.2-day orbital period and M p sin i of about half of a Jupiter mass. Its velocity semi-amplitude is K = 59 m s -1 , which is significantly larger than</p><p>Mayor &amp; Queloz's velocity measurement precision of 13 m s -1 . In contrast, the radial velocity signal of the Sun due to Jupiter's orbit is only about 13 m s -1 . We note also that the radial velocity technique is sensitive to M p sin i, rather than M p . Thus, RVs allow only to measure a lower limit to the mass of a planet, unless the inclination i of the system can be determined by some independent means (e. g. the transit method).  Reaching this level of measurement precision opens up new possibilities for planet detection. While the radial velocity signal of an Earth-mass planet in a 1-AU orbit around a solar-mass star is only 9 cm s -1 <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 2</ref>.1), we do have the measurement precision to detect habitable Earths around low-mass M stars, and to detect Super Earths (planets of a few Earth masses) in short-period orbits around solar-mass stars.</p><p>These Super Earths are objects in the transition region between the masses of ice-giants like Uranus and Neptune and the masses of the rocky terrestrial planets of our inner Solar System. An extremely wide variety of compositions of such planets is possible, with mixtures of various fractions of metals (iron and nickel), silicates, -ices‖ (water, methane, ammonia, etc.) and H 2 -He. The detection of these objects, and the measurement of their mass and radius (for those that undergo transits), will open up exciting new areas of planetary astrophysics.</p><p>The main factors currently limiting the precision of the RVs, in addition to photon noise, are stellar noise, the wavelength calibration, telescope guiding, stability in the illumination of the spectrograph, and detector-related effects. The only solution to photon noise is more photons. This may come from either larger telescopes equipped with high-precision spectrographs, or more telescope time on existing facilities permitting longer exposures without compromising the size of the samples of stars surveyed for planets. Indications are that the remedy to the problem of stellar noise may be similar. Longer exposures or binning over suitable timescales (again implying access to more telescope time) can reduce astrophysical jitter to some extent by averaging out those intrinsic variations (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</p><p>Planets often occur in multi-planet systems. The first of these found was the system around υ And. Intensive follow-up observations often reveal the presence of additional planets in the system. Many times, these planets will be gravitationally interacting with each other. The study of such interactions helps us to understand the dynamics of planetary system formation and evolution. Doppler studies have revealed that approximately 10% of all F, G, and K stars have at least one planet in the mass range 0.3−10 M Jup with periods between 2 and 2000 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Extrapolating to longer periods, it is estimated that 17-19% of stars have a gas giant within 20 AU. We have also learned that gas giant formation is much more efficient around stars with super-solar metallicity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Transits</head><p>The transit method met its first success in 1999 with the transit observation of the RV planet HD 209458b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>.5, left). It then became popular for two reasons: 1) the detection of a planetary transit around a bright star requires a telescope as small as 20-cm in diameter, and many transit surveys were initiated after this first success; 2) studies of a planetary system seen edge-on (i ≈ 90°) is much richer than for systems at any inclination, because the radius and the mass are directly measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>After the current success of ground-based transit searches like OGLE, major transit discoveries are expected from space, or already obtained ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>.5, right). Several NASA and ESA missions have been dedicated to exoplanet transits in large part or in total. The Kepler mission aims to determine the frequency of occurrence of Earth analogs, by monitoring ~100,000 solar-type stars (a field in Cygnus) for four years <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The CoRoT mission is similarly monitoring numerous solar-type stars to determine the frequency of occurrence of Super Earths, and to find and characterize exoplanets ranging in size from giant planets, down to Super Earths. CoRoT has already identified new giant transiting planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), and the CoRoT team is currently working to extend the detections to much smaller planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Right: the same system observed by HST/STIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Principles</head><p>The transit method consists in detecting the shallow dip in a stellar light curve when a planet crosses the line of sight towards its host star during its revolution. It thus requires an almost perfect alignment between the observer, the planet, and the star.</p><p>The transit appears periodically, with a period equal to the revolution period of the planet. The probability P tr for a planetary system to show a transit is a direct relation to the star radius R and the semi-major axis a: tr P R a  .</p><p>Applying this equation to the solar system, it follows that the Earth in front of the Sun has a 1/214 probability to produce a transit for a distant observer; for Jupiter the value is 1/1100. With the discovery of the -hot Jupiter‖ class of planets, the prospects of detecting exoplanets by looking for transits improved dramatically. For 51 Peg b, the transit probability is about 10% and transit events recur every ~ 4 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>A planetary system observed edge-on, as in the case of transiting systems, also offers the geometry for the strongest radial velocity (RV) signal to be observed; moreover, the -sin i‖ indetermination for the mass disappears, so studying the planet transit light curve we can determine its physical parameters: radius, orbital inclination i, density, surface gravity, orbital distance a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Measured parameters</head><p>The planetary transit measured in the stellar light curve is mainly described by three parameters: depth, duration, shape. Depending on the latitude of the transit on the stellar disk, the transit light curve will be U-shaped (central occultation) or V-shaped (grazing occultation). Quantitatively, the related parameter is the duration of the ingress and egress (alternatively, the duration of the flat bottom of the transit) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Let us calculate these parameters in the simplified case of a circular orbit and a stellar disc of uniform brightness. The sketch of a planetary transit is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.6.</p><p>Ingress (resp. egress) is defined as the phase from contact 1 (resp. 3) to contact 2 (resp. 4). The -flat bottom‖ corresponds to phases 2 to 3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.6: Definition of transit light-curve observables. Two schematic light curves are shown on the bottom (solid and dotted lines), and the corresponding geometry of the star and planet is shown on the top. Indicated on the solid light curve are the transit depth ΔF, the total transit duration tT, and the transit duration between ingress and egress tF (i.e., the ‗‗flat part '' of the transit light curve when the planet is fully superimposed on the parent star). The planet is shown from first to fourth contact. Also defined are R*, Rp, and impact parameter b corresponding to orbital inclination i <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Transit depth. The depth of the transit is related to the star and planet radii (R and r respectively):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2.2)</formula><p>F off is the observed stellar flux out of transit, and F on is the observed flux during transit. This formula neglects the phenomenon known as limb darkening, i.e. the fact that stars appear slightly brighter in their centre than near the edge. Taking limb darkening into account makes the transits slightly deeper than (r/R) 2 , and gives the light curve a more rounded shape (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 2.</ref>7 and par. 2.2.3). Transit duration. The total duration of the transit, for a circular orbit, is related to the orbital parameters and to the star radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(2.3)</formula><p>Parameter P is the orbital period, in the same unit as d, and a is the orbital radius in the same unit as R and r; i is the inclination of the orbit.</p><p>The expression cos a bi R  is the impact parameter and represents the projected distance of the planet's centre to the star's equator in units of star's radius. More userfriendly equations of (2.3) are (as expressed against P or a):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(2.4)</formula><p>where M is the star's mass, the mass of the planet being negligible. Contrarily to Eq.</p><p>2.3, d is here in hours, P in days, a in astronomical unit, and R and M are both in solar units.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">22 1 cos PR r a di a R R                </formula><p>Ingress duration. Another temporal parameter of the transit is the duration of the ingress or egress:</p><p>(2.5)</p><p>One may also consider the transit shape by deriving the ratio of the durations of the flat bottom (t F ) over the total transit (d):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(2.6)</formula><p>The three equations describing a planetary transit (depth, total duration and ingress duration), can be used to constrain four unknown parameters of the system: r, R, M, b.</p><p>The star's mass and radius may be independently constrained by other observations, specifically high-resolution spectroscopy, as well as with stellar evolution models. For instance, for low-mass stars, MR  is a fairly good approximation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Limb darkening</head><p>Light curves taken in a bandpass blueward of ~1 μm for solar-like stars show noticeable limb darkening. Thus, including limb-darkening is important for computing accurate eclipse lightcurves. The general effect of limb darkening is to (1) change the depth of the light curve ΔF as a function of impact parameter (making the light curve deeper for most values of impact parameter), (2) make the flat bottom rounder (and hence the ‗‗flat part '' shorter, thus reducing t F ), and (3) blur the boundary between ingress/egress and the flat bottom <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These effects are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.7.</p><p>It is possible to incorporate limb darkening into the mathematical description of a planet transit light curve by parameterizing the transit shape by the slope of the ingress/egress instead of by t F and t T . The ingress/egress slope is mainly dependent on the time it takes the planet to cross the stellar limb but is also affected by limb darkening. The transit depth ΔF is also dependent on limb darkening and orbital inclination.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 1 r t d b R </formula><p>The limb-darkening of main-sequence stars is represented by functions of μ = cosθ, where θ is the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the line of sight to the observer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>.8). Claret <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> has found that the most accurate limb-darkening functions are the quadratic law in μ and the -nonlinear" law which is a Taylor series to fourth order in μ 1/2 (see Appendix B); the latter conserves flux to better than 0.05%.</p><p>Mandel &amp; Agol <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> have computed analytic functions for transit lightcurves for the quadratic and nonlinear limb-darkening laws which are very used by the community. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.4">Elliptical orbits</head><p>Due to the higher probability of detecting transits of short-period planets, which orbits are rapidly circularized by tidal effects, it is usually sufficient to consider the transit formalism for circular orbits, as given above. However, as more and more eccentric transiting planets are discovered, the need for a more general set of equations has become increasingly exigent. Here we present the model of Tingley &amp; Sackett <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> which has been also developed by <ref type="bibr">Kipping [23]</ref>.</p><p>In this case, the transit duration (and shape) depends on the planet position on its orbits (hereafter, the phase angle φ, with respect to the periastron of the ellipse). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   2</ref>.9 shows how the transit duration evolves with phase angle and orbital eccentricity. The transit duration in an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e is <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(2.7)</formula><p>where G is the gravitational constant and ρ is the star-planet distance at the time of the transit, corresponding to a phase angle φ.</p><p>Another effect of an eccentricity greater than zero is to change the timing of the secondary eclipse. If t 1 − t 2 is the time interval between the primary and secondary eclipses, then we get <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(2.8)</formula><p>The exact timing of a secondary eclipse may thus be derived if the orbit is precisely known, or alternatively, the observation of the secondary eclipse may provide an accurate estimate of the orbital eccentricity (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>).</p><p>The most eccentric orbit discovered for a transiting planet is the one of HD 80606b</p><p>which has also the longest period (111 days). Its transit egress has also been observed from University of London Observatory, London and has allowed a better constrain of its orbital parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[149]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Measurement requirements</head><p>The principal requirement of transit measurements is high photometric and spectrophotometric precision, on relatively bright stars. This need for precision derives from the fact that transit measurements are made in the combined light of the star plus planet. Hence the planet signal is greatly diluted by the stellar photons, and the measurement precision must be as high as possible. Moreover, the time scale of the photometric noise is crucial. Since transits are typically a few hours in duration, the precision of individual measurements should improve as the inverse square-root of the measurement time, for times exceeding several hours. Since a photometric baseline is required before and after transit, a reasonable time scale for the required stability is ~20 hours. Since both visible and IR measurements are important for transits, the instrumentation should be designed to reach the fundamental limits determined by the stellar photon noise (primarily important in the visible) and the background noise caused by the thermal emission of the instrument, telescope, and zodiacal dust (primarily important in the IR).</p><p>For more extended (-around-the-orbit‖) science, the phenomena being measured have time scales of several days, so ~20 day stability is needed. Since there is also scientific motivation to study much longer-term changes on exoplanets, due for example to seasonal effects for transiting planets in longer period orbits, then eventually there may be motivation to extend the stability time to ~20 months.</p><p>Ground-based photometry has made great strides, and is achieving sub-milli-magnitude precision in favorable cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, for most exoplanet characterization science, space-borne observations will be necessary. The best location for a space-borne transit mission is heliocentric orbit, or placement at a Lagrangian point. Although significant transit science can be done from near-Earth orbit, those orbits have two principal limitations: 1) long uninterrupted observing times, such as are needed for exoplanet around-the-orbit observations, are generally not possible from a near-Earth location, and 2) proximity to the Earth results in time-variable scattered light and thermal radiation that can interfere with achieving the necessary precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Anyhow it is important to set up suitable strategies of data analysis to discard false alarm detections, that can be caused by stellar effects like flares, spots, coronal effects or intrinsic stellar variation, as well as photometric binaries with grazing eclipses or whose image is blended with another constant star. For the case of ground based observations, attention must also be paid to atmospheric effects like air mass, absorption bands, seeing and scintillation. But transits may be caused by binary stars or brown dwarfs instead of exoplanets. All these are motivations for spectroscopic follow up observations, in order to confirm the real detection of a transiting planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.6">Transit missions and surveys</head><p>New transit candidates are currently searched for in dedicated ground based photometric surveys and are the targets of space missions. Several projects have been successful in detection of exoplanets, among the others we remember:</p><p> SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) with 18 discoveries (personal communication) thanks to two robotic observatories, one in the Canaries and the other in South Africa.</p><p> HATNet (Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network) with 13 detections made by six small fully-automated telescopes in Arizona and Hawaii.</p><p> OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) has discovered 8 transiting planets using a 1.3 m telescope in Las Campanas, Chile.</p><p> The XO project with 5 planets found with a network of telescopes led by the XO observatory in the Hawaii.</p><p> TrES (Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey) with 4 discoveries made with a network of three small-aperture telescopes located in California, Arizona and Canary</p><p>Islands.</p><p>Another extension of transit searches from the ground could be carried out in Antarctica, where the duty cycle is larger and skies potentially transparent and stable for high-accuracy photometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Here we describe the two space mission already operational: the CoRoT satellite and the Kepler mission.</p></div>

At the moment, CoRoT is moving into a circular polar orbit with an altitude of 896 km, this kind of orbit allows the space telescope to observe the same field of view continuously for 150 days. Zone observed are at less than 10° from the perpendicular to the orbit meaning there are no Earth occultations. Mission flight operations were originally scheduled to end 2.5 years from launch but to date flight operations have been extended to January 2010. For the extrasolar planet study, in each field of view 12000 stars with brightness between 11 and 16 mag are observed in the R band. This is because brighter stars (mag &lt; 11) would saturate the CCDs while the fainter ones would not provide data with a sufficient resolution. At least 2-3 transits have to be detected by CoRoT in order to be sure of the discovery of a new exoplanet (only for giant planets a single transit can be enough) so almost all the detectable planets can have an orbital period shorter than 75 days.</p><p>During the northern summer the telescope observes in an area around Serpens Cauda, toward the galactic bulge, and during the winter it observes in Monoceros, towards the anticentre of the Milky Way. Fields of view have been chosen so that sunlight cannot interfere with measurements. During the remaining 30 days between the two main observation periods, CoRoT is pointed to 5 other patches of sky. Data already collected on ground shows that lightcurves with a precision of a part over 20,000 are obtainable. When many transits are observed, precision will be higher and as a consequence, small planets down to the size of Earth will be in the grasp of COROT <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[166]</ref>. To date, CoRoT team has announced the detection of 7 exoplanets. Identification rate is constrained by the fact transit candidates need to be confirmed by radial-velocity follow-up observations (see par. 2.2.5). Moreover, these surveys enable the determination of the mass of the planet (see par. 2.2.1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Kepler</head><p>Kepler is a Discovery-class mission designed to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems by surveying a large sample of stars.</p><p>The primary goal of Kepler is to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size or larger planets in or near the habitable zone of solarlike stars and get statistical data on the population and distribution of such planets. The satellite hosts a photometer which has a 0.95-meter aperture Schmidt type telescope with a 1.4-meter primary mirror. This aperture is sufficient to reduce the Poisson noise to the level required to obtain a 4σ detection for a single transit from an Earth-size planet transiting a 12 th magnitude G2 dwarf with a 6.5 hour transit <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Kepler's photometer has a very wide field of view for an astronomical telescope of about 15 degrees in diameter. The total mass at launch is 1052.4 kilograms consisting of 562.7-kilograms for the spacecraft, 478.0-kilograms for the photometer, and 11.7 kilograms of hydrazine propellant. The overall size is about 2.7 meters in diameter and 4.7 meters high. The array is cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator.</p><p>Data from the CCDs are extracted every six seconds to limit saturation and added on board to form a 15-minute sum for each pixel. Data for a subset of target stars can be measured at a cadence of once per minute. This option will be exercised for detecting changes in transit timing due to the presence of multiple planets or moons <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.    Commissioning phase lasted for 60 days after launch. Major activities during this period included initial acquisition of the spacecraft's signal and confirmation of a valid radio link with the ground, confirmation that the spacecraft is generating its own electrical power via its solar panels and has returned telemetry recorded during launch.</p><p>This phase also included jettisoning of the photometer dust cover, checkout and calibration of the photometer, and fine-tuning of the spacecraft's guidance system. On  Kepler is designed to continuously monitor the brightness of more than 10 5 F through M dwarfs (of magnitude from 9 th to 15 th and of low variability) in the Milky Way galaxy. Kepler must measure at least three transits that show that the orbital period repeats to a precision of at least 10 ppm and that shows at least a 7σ detection to classify a signal as a valid planetary candidate. A detection threshold of 7σ is required to avoid false positives due to random noise.  Moreover, since larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, the first reported results are expected to be larger Jupiter sized planets in tight orbits. These could be reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets further from their sun will take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth is expected to take three years or longer. On 6 August 2009 it was already announced the detection of the previously known exoplanet HAT-P-7b. Measurements were so precise that it was able to detect a smooth rise and fall of the light caused by the changing phases of the planet. The photometric precision reached was in accordance with the expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[99]</ref>. The photometer points to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco, which is well out of the ecliptic plane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits the Sun. Cygnus is also a good choice to observe because it will never be obscured by Kuiper belt objects or the asteroid belt. An additional benefit of that choice is that Kepler is pointing in the direction of the Solar System's motion around the centre of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which are observed by</p><p>Kepler are roughly the same distance from the galaxy centre as the Solar System, and also close to the galactic plane. This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability. Kepler has specifically developed technology that will likely be very beneficial to future transit missions. For transit measurements, mathematical techniques to perform high-precision data analysis (e.g., decorrelation techniques), and techniques to execute observations in an optimal manner, carry an importance on a par with, or exceeding, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Microlensing</head><p>Microlensing is the only known method capable of discovering planets at truly great distances from the Earth. Whereas spectroscopy searches for planets in our immediate galactic neighborhood, up to 100 light years from Earth, and photometry can potentially detect planets at a distance of hundreds of light-years, microlensing can find planets orbiting stars near the centre of the galaxy, thousands of light-years away <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[168]</ref>.</p><p>Microlensing's disproportionately large contribution stems from its ability to probe regions of parameter space that are currently inaccessible to other methods. In particular, microlensing is most sensitive to planets in the cold, outer regions of systems beyond the snow line, the point in the protoplanetary disk exterior to which the temperature is less than the condensation temperature of water (Lecar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[167]</ref>;</p><p>Kennedy &amp; Kenyon <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>). Giant planets are thought to form in the region immediately beyond this line, where the surface density of solids is highest and thus planet formation is most efficient. It is also thought that this region is likely to be the ultimate source of the water for habitable planets. In addition, microlensing is sensitive to very low-mass planets, potentially down to the mass of Mars. Finally, microlensing is the only method capable of detecting old, free-floating planets, hypothesized to be a common by-product of planet formation and evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Microlensing is a remarkable astronomical effect, predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. According to Einstein, when the light emanating from a star passes very close to another star on its way to an observer on Earth, the gravity of the intermediary star will slightly bend the light rays from the source star, causing the two stars to appear farther apart than they normally would. This effect was used by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1919 to provide the first empirical evidence for General</p><p>Relativity.</p><p>If the source star is positioned not just close to the intermediary star when seen from</p><p>Earth, but precisely behind it, this effect is doubled. Light rays from the source star pass on both sides of the intermediary, or "lensing" star. Since both light streams are bent by the lensing star's gravity, the source star should appear doubled from Earth --once on each side of the lensing star ( The resulting effect is a sudden dramatic increase in the brightness of the lensing star, by as much as 1,000 times. This typically lasts for a few weeks or months before the source star moves out of alignment with the lensing star and the brightness subsides. If a planet is positioned close enough to the lensing star so that it crosses one of the two light streams emanating from the source star, the planet's own gravity bends the light stream and temporarily produces a third image of the source star ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2.25 4)</ref>. When measured from Earth, this effect appears as a temporary spike of brightness, lasting several hours to several days, superimposed upon the regular pattern of the microlensing event. For planet hunters, such spikes are the telltale signs of the presence of a planet. Furthermore, the precise characteristics of the microlensing light-curve, its intensity and length, tell a great deal about the planet itself. Its total mass, its orbit, and its period can all be deduced with a high degree of accuracy and probability from the microlensing event <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Microlensing is capable of finding the furthest and the smallest planets of any currently available method for detecting extrasolar planets. Anyway, these planets will never be observed again. This is because microlensing is dependent on rare and random events -the passage of one star precisely in front of another, as seen from</p><p>Earth. This makes the discovery of planets by this method both difficult and unpredictable and forces to observe stellar zones with many sources, like our Galactic Bulge and the Large Magellanic Cloud, providing a high, not (strongly) biased, sample of stars. As a result, despite years of intense observations, to date only thirteen planets have been detected with microlensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[168]</ref> (out of which 9 have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">2007- BLG-192-L b 0.01 - - 0.62 - - 2008 MOA-2007- BLG-400-L b 0.9 - - 0.85 - - 2008 OGLE-06- 109L b 0.71 - 1825 2.3 - - 2008 OGLE-06- 109L c 0.27 - 5100 4.6 0.11 59 2008 MOA-2008- BLG-310-L b 0.23 - - 1.25 - - 2009</formula><p>The detection of two cool, -Super Earth‖ planets among the first four planets  Observations are usually performed using networks of robotic telescopes. The most active programs are the NASA/National Science Foundation-funded OGLE and MOA (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics).

John Observatory using a 1.8 m reflector telescope built for the project.</p><p>OGLE (see also par. 2.2.6) is a Polish astronomical project based on observations performed in Las Campanas. Every night the "Warsaw" telescope is pointed toward the same dense field of 100 million stars in the vicinity of the galactic bulge, while the telescope's complex CCD cameras note any change in brightness of any point in the star-field. Every year OGLE detects around 500 microlensing events, but planet detections are extremely rare.</p><p>Whenever OGLE detects a microlensing event, it contacts a network of telescopes that specialize in searching for signs of the presence of a planet. The networks, known as PLANET (Probing Lensing Anomalies) and Robonet, include 1 and 2 meter telescopes in La Silla (Chile), Hobart (Tasmania, Australia), Perth (Australia), Boyden (South Africa), Sutherland (Australia), La Palma (Spain), and Haleakala (Hawaii).</p><p>Together, the telescopes are able to continuously cover each microlensing event,</p><p>providing an accurate light curve and indicating whether a planet is present or not. The full potential of the microlensing technique can only be achieved from a space mission. Ground-based microlensing surveys are inherently limited in the mass and separations of the planets they can detect. Because of the high density of stars in the Galactic bulge, main-sequence source stars are not generally resolved in ground-based images. As a result, the photometry needed to detect Earth-mass planets can generally only be obtained when the source is significantly magnified. This, in turn, implies that ground-based microlensing is typically only sensitive to terrestrial planets located close to the Einstein ring (at ~1.5-5 AU). Furthermore, obtaining the accurate photometry of the smaller and fainter main-sequence stars that is required to detect planets with mass much smaller than the Earth is effectively impossible from the ground.</p><p>Ground-based microlensing surveys also suffer losses in data coverage and quality due to poor weather and seeing. As a result, a significant fraction of the planetary deviations seen in a groundbased microlensing survey will have poor light-curve coverage and therefore poorly constrained parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>For all but a small fraction of planetary microlensing events, the detection of light from the host star is necessary to allow the star and planet masses and separation in physical units to be determined. This can be accomplished with HST or ground-based adaptive optics observations for a small number of planetary microlensing events <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, but space-based survey data will be needed for the detection of host stars for hundreds or thousands of planetary microlensing events. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Astrometry</head><p>A star in a planetary system would move around the barycentre in a circular or elliptical path projected on the plane of the sky. This motion can be observed and measured with astrometry. It is the oldest method used to detect extrasolar planets and it enables the study of regular wobble in a star's position which could have been caused by a companion planet.</p><p>First, one should determine the observed ellipse ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2.29)</ref>. Next, data has to be fitted on a model of Keplerian orbital motion.

Through astrometry, it is possible to survey a bigger sample of stars (i.e., more massive, young, pre main sequence) and to overcome some of the limits in the RV surveys, e.g., those due to stars with complex (few or broad) spectral features. It would be also possible to detect exoplanets around young stars, to probe the time scale of planet formation and migration processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Because the astrometric signal increases linearly with the semimajor axis a of the planetary orbit, systems with even rather small masses would be more easily detectable at large enough values of a.

An observer located at 10 pc from the Sun would observe an angular amplitude of 500 microarcsec due to the motion of Jupiter and an amplitude of 0.3 microarcsec in the case of the Earth. Thus, measurements require accuracy below 0.1 milliarcsec to detect objects smaller than Jupiter at distances of 50-200 pc. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 2</ref>.3 shows some values of α.</p><p>Measuring displacements of the order of a few milliarcsecs are impossible using standard imaging techniques from ground based observatories, due to effects of the atmosphere like turbulence and refraction that prevents the precise centering of images.

When the pulsar is moving away from the Earth, the time between each pulse becomes slightly longer; conversely, when the pulsar is moving toward the Earth, the time between pulses becomes slightly shorter. By measuring these periodic changes in pulse timing, it is possible not only to deduce the existence of a planet orbiting around the pulsar, but also to estimate the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and place a lower limit on the mass of the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.

Since these stars are difficult to observe with astrometry or RV, magnetospheric emissions may offer a path to detecting planets in these systems.</p><p>In the case of the Earth, its magnetic field may contribute to its habitability by protecting its atmosphere from solar wind erosion and by preventing energetic particles from reaching its surface. Indirect evidence for at least some extrasolar giant planets also having magnetic fields includes the modulation of calcium emission lines of their host stars phased with the planetary orbits likely due to magnetic reconnection events between the stellar and planetary fields. If magnetic fields are a generic property of giant planets, then extrasolar giant planets should emit at radio wavelengths allowing for their direct detection. In the case of terrestrial-mass planets, if magnetized, they</p><p>should also emit at radio wavelengths. There are a number of ground-based instruments under construction that promise significant improvements in sensitivity.

So 3 H  is a crucial detection target; even if detection is unsuccessful, such measurement provides at least an improved upper limit on its abundance (Shkolnik et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[94]</ref>). Calculations of the 3 H  abundance on a hot-Jupiter (Yelle <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[95]</ref>) show that the contrast between 3 H  emission and stellar brightness places it just on the current limit of detectability with a large ground-based telescope. Even if it is a very challenging observation, it would be the best diagnostics to understand the properties of the upper atmospheres of Hot-Jupiters (Koskinen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[96]</ref>) whereas observations of the Lyman alpha line could be partially or totally contaminated by energetic neutral atoms from charge exchange between stellar wind protons and neutral hydrogen from the planetary exospheres (Holmstrom et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[97]</ref>) or inadequately analyzed and understood (Ben-Jaffel <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[93]</ref>).</p><p>Clouds and hazes. At the spectral resolution we can obtain today from space, the best we can do is to assess their presence, as they are supposed to flatten the spectral signatures or modify the spectral shape.

The overall transmission spectrum is shaped by the water absorption in the infrared.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Towards smaller mass planets</head><p>For both primary and secondary transit methods, smaller size/colder planets will increase the challenge. Transmission spectroscopy can benefit from very extended atmospheres: this scenario can occur if the main atmospheric component has a light molecular weight and a high temperature. The lighter, the hotter and the smaller the core, the easier is the observation in transmission spectroscopy (i.e. the more detectable are the spectral features). In the case of secondary transits, the parameters playing the major role are the size of the planet compared to its parent star and the planetary temperature for observations in the IR or the albedo in the visible <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>With current telescopes we can already approach the case of hot Neptunes transiting later type stars, e.g. Gliese 436b (Deming et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[64]</ref>). For rocky planets within their star's habitable zones, we need to wait for JWST. They have the highest priority as these have the potential to harbor life. Our science goal is to find and characterize all nearby exoplanets so that within the decade we could answer long-standing questions about the evolution and nature of other planetary systems, and we could search for clues as to whether life exists elsewhere in our galactic neighborhood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">The Habitable Zone</head><p>The circumstellar Habitable Zone (HZ) is defined as the region around a star within which an Earth-like planet can sustain liquid water on its surface, a condition necessary for photosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Within the HZ, starlight is sufficiently intense for a greenhouse atmosphere to maintain a surface temperature above 273 K, and low enough not to initiate runaway greenhouse conditions that can vaporize the whole water reservoir, allow photodissociation of water vapour into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen and the loss of hydrogen to space (This was the fate of Venus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The Continuously HZ is the region that remains habitable for durations longer than 1 Gyr. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">Figure 3</ref>.7 shows the limits of the Continuously HZ as a function of the stellar mass. Planets inside the HZ are not necessarily habitable. They can be too small, like Mars, to maintain active geology and to limit the gravitational escape of their atmospheres. They can be too massive, like HD69830d, and have accreted a thick H 2 -He envelope below which water cannot be liquid. However, planet formation models predict abundant Earth-like planets with the right range of masses (0.5 -8 M⊕) and water abundances (0.01-10% by mass) <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[101]</ref>. On these grounds, it would seem that high-mass starts are the best candidates for finding planets within a habitable zone. However, these stars emit most of their radiation in the far ultraviolet (FUV), which can be highly damaging to life, and also contributes to photodissociation and the loss of water. Furthermore, the lifetimes of these stars is so short (around 10 million years) that one can debate whether there is enough time for life to develop.</p><p>Then, we have the medium-mass stars like our own Sun. They make up about 15% percent of the stars in the galaxy, have reasonably-broad HZs, do not suffer from FUV irradiation, and have lifetimes of the order of 10 billion years. Therefore, they are among the best candidates for harboring planets where life might be able to begin.</p><p>After that, we should consider red dwarfs. They have the longest lifetimes of all, are the smallest and coolest type of star and by far the most common. Critical factors assumed to be impediments to habitability include relatively little energy output and thus reduced habitable zones and high stellar variation. In fact M dwarfs, especially during their early age, have strong magnetic activity, which makes them relatively bright in X-rays and UV radiation and causes them to flare frequently. As they age, red dwarfs become less magnetically active. Therefore, planets around red dwarfs in the HZ could be habitable if they can maintain a magnetic field for the 2 to 3 billion years that a red dwarf is active so that they can hold onto their atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[104]</ref>.</p><p>However, their HZs are very close in so the star's gravity would likely cause tidal lock.</p><p>The daylight side of the planet would face the star all the time, while the night-time side would always face away from it. This implies they are rotating slowly around their axis so they could have a weak magnetic field that could shut down completely. This is what happened to Mars. It had a magnetic field 3.5 billion years ago, but when its liquid iron core solidified, the field turned off. Without this protective shield, the solar wind stripped away most of the planet's atmosphere and liquid water. To avoid this fate around a red dwarf a planet might need to be more massive than Earth. The large liquid iron core inside a super Earth (see par. 3.2.1) could perhaps maintain a magnetic field in spite of the slower rotation rate.</p><p>Moreover, because of the tidal locking, potential life could be limited to a ring-like region between a hot area and a deep freeze. Joshi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[171]</ref> have shown that a planet's atmosphere needs to contain at least 100 mbars of greenhouse gas, e.g. CO 2 , or 10% of Earth's atmosphere, for the star's heat to be effectively carried from the day side to the night side. This is well within the levels required for photosynthesis, though water may still remain frozen on the dark side. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Possible Super-Earth Planets detected within the HZ</head><p>Direct planetary observations led in 2007 to the discovery of the first possibly terrestrial planet within a star's habitable zone (Udry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[117]</ref>). Gliese 581 c is believed to be a rocky planet with a radius 1.5 times that of Earth and a minimum mass of roughly five times Earth around a M3V-type star. A direct measurement of the radius cannot be taken because the planet is not a transiting object but we know that it completes a full orbit in just under 13 days. It is notable as it is the planet with lowest minimum mass yet discovered in the habitable zone of another star, making it the most "earthlike" exoplanet found to date. According to <ref type="bibr">Udry et al. [117]</ref>, the effective temperature for Gliese 581 c, assuming an albedo such as Venus', would be −3 °C, and assuming an Earth-like albedo, then it would be 40 °C, a range of temperatures which overlaps with the range that water would be liquid at a pressure of 1 atmosphere.</p><p>However, the effective temperature and actual surface temperature can be very different due to the greenhouse properties of the planetary atmosphere. For example, a speculative model by von Bloh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[121]</ref> estimates a temperature of around 500° due to a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that of Venus.</p><p>Subsequent observations revealed that also the outermost planet Gliese 581 d is within the habitable zone (M. Mayor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[122]</ref>). With a mass of roughly 7 Earths and an orbit of 66.8 Earth days <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[117]</ref>, it is a potential candidate for being able to support life <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[121]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[122]</ref>.</p><p>However, the last word about these planets could be given only when we will be able to measure their spectra. So, starting with Kepler and JWST we now expect to detect and characterize terrestrial-size planets and determine if they are within the habitable zones of their stars. Such observational refinements may allow us to better gauge how common potentially habitable worlds are, and therefore allow us a much better idea of how common life in the universe might be.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Biosignatures</head><p>To know whether a planet in the HZ is actually inhabited, we need to search for biosignatures, features that are specific to biological activities and can be detected by If we knew other examples of life forms, we could directly compare them and begin to discern general principles of the origins and evolution of life. We know the history of only one biosphere so, having few data, our task is more difficult. However, we can say that here on Earth most biological molecules are made from covalent combinations of six very common elements, whose chemical symbols are CHNOPS.</p><p>Moreover, we can say that observations have led to some interesting discoveries:</p><p>glycolaldehyde, the simplest possible sugar, was identified in a giant cloud of gas and dust near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[172]</ref> and in a star-forming region <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[173]</ref>;</p><p>copious amounts of nitrogen containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PANHs), molecules critical to all known forms of life, have been found in a galaxy 12 million light-years away with Spitzer Space Telescope <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[174]</ref>; Glycine, an amino acid used by living organisms to make proteins, has been recognized in samples of comet Wild 2 returned by Nasa's Stardust spacecraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[175]</ref>. The fact that complex, important biogenic compounds of CHNOPS elements have been found in space suggests that life around the universe can be based on these common elements and that the building blocks of life are prevalent in space. Herein we assume that all life requires complex organic compounds that interact in a liquid water solvent. These assumptions do not seem overly restrictive, given that life is an information-rich entity that depends fundamentally upon the strong polarity of its Lovelock reasoned that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of the Martian atmosphere and, thus, alter it. However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its chemical equilibrium, with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically-dynamic mixture of that of our Earth's biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[177]</ref>. Therefore, one should conclude that a biosignature is a molecule which presence alters the chemical equilibrium of a planet atmosphere in a way that this disequilibrium cannot be explained solely by nonbiological processes.</p></div>

This model assumes blackbody continuum spectra at the effective temperature of each object, plus reflectance spectra proportional to the visible albedo of each planet.</p><p>The zodiacal light component is appropriate to a 0.1 AU diameter patch centered at 1.0 AU from the central star. The molecular band absorption features for the Earth's atmosphere have been superimposed for reference. We note that the contrast ratio (planet/star) of the Earth-twin is about 10 -10 in the visible and 10 -7 in the infrared. Earth's spectrum is crudely similar to that of a blackbody with a temperature of ~255 K. Earth's surface is 33 degrees warmer than that due mostly to greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere: water, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are opaque to infrared radiation and their presence reduces the cooling of the planet by emission. Without the insulating effect provided by these greenhouse gasses all water would be frozen into ice <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.  Other remarkable spectral features include methane (CH 4 band at 7.4 μm and 0.88 μm,) and species released as a consequence of biological fixation of nitrogen, such as ammonia (NH 3 at 6 and 9-11 μm), nitrous oxide (N 2 O at 7.8, 8.5 and 17 μm) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 at 6.2 μm). Methane and ammonia commonly appear in cold hydrogen-rich atmospheres, but they are not expected as abiotic constituents of Earthsize planetary atmospheres at habitable orbital distances. Known abiotic routes do not produce nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p><p>According to some models of atmospheric evolution (Pavlov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[105]</ref>), methane was biologically maintained 2.5-3.0 billion years ago produced by methanogenic bacteria. But, CH 4 could have been produced abiotically as well from submarine outgassing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Astrobiology of the Moons of the Outer Solar System</head><p>The outer solar system provides a rich and rewarding assortment of planetary diversity of high interest to astrobiology. Spacecraft missions, particularly the Galileo mission and the Cassini-Huygens mission, indicate the potential habitability of planetary bodies in the outer solar system and in effect extended our concept of habitability (which was previously limited to Earth-like planets) to water worlds which are covered by ice, examples are Europa and Ganymede. Titan is a special case with its plethora of organic compounds closely related to prebiotic terrestrial chemistry for which habitability may be linked to an organic solvent that forms large liquid pools on the moon's surface. Enceladus is another unusual case, possibly containing subsurface reservoirs of liquid water and organic compounds that could have led to prebiotic chemistry or even life.</p><p>Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. This young surface is striated by cracks and streaks, while craters are relatively infrequent. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[181]</ref>. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[182]</ref>.</p><p>Enceladus is a relatively small satellite, with a mean diameter of 505 km. Cassini performed several close flybys of Enceladus and revealed a plume venting from the moon's south polar region containing salt-water and organic compounds such as carbonates and dust grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>. This discovery, along with the presence of escaping internal heat, extensive linear cracks <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[183]</ref> and very few impact craters in the south polar region, shows that Enceladus is geologically active today. Moreover, it gives strengthen evidence of the presence of sub-surface liquid water, which might also make it possible for Enceladus to support life (Parkinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[184]</ref>). The primary significance of any life detection in the outer solar system would be that this life would most likely constitute a separate origin from life on Earth, thus allowing an assessment of how different (or exotic) life can be and insights into whether life is common in the universe or not. The mid-infrared primary transit observations described here allow us to probe the terminator region of HD 209458b (see par. 3.1) between the bar and millibar level.</p><p>First of all we desire to introduce three important equipments that have allowed these observations and the subsequent data reduction: Spitzer Observatory, the Infrared Array Camera and SExtractor package.</p></div>

Broadband, photometric measurements have been reported for HD 209458b, TrES-1, HD 189733b and υ Andromeda b (see par.</p><p>3.1). Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths.</p><p>Previous space-based satellites (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were operational during the 1980s and 1990s</p><p>and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.</p><p>In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after successful demonstration of operation, on December 18 2003. Unlike most telescopes which are named after famous deceased astronomers by a board of scientists, the name for   Once a week, a new sequence of commands is uplinked, telling the observatory what scientific targets to observe and when. The mission's telescope has a Ritchey-Chrétien design, the primary mirror is 85 cm in diameter, f/12 and made of beryllium. The telescope is attached to the top of the vapor-cooled cryostat shell. Only the portions of the three science instruments that need to be chilled are contained in the multiple instrument chamber, which is mounted directly to the helium tank in the cryostat shell.</p><p>These three instruments have allowed performing imaging and photometry from 3 to 180 micrometers, spectroscopy from 5 to 40 micrometers, and spectrophotometry from 5 to 100 micrometers. They are:  IRS (Infrared Spectrograph): an infrared spectrometer with four sub-modules which operate at the wavelengths 5.3-14 µm (low resolution), 10-19.5 µm (high resolution), 14-40 µm (low resolution), and 19-37 µm (high resolution).</p><formula xml:id="formula_10"></formula><p>Each module uses a 128x128 pixel detector --the short wavelength pair use arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology, the long wavelength pair use antimony-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology.</p><p> MIPS (Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer): three detector arrays in the far infrared (128 × 128 pixels at 24 µm, 32 × 32 pixels at 70 µm, 2 × 20 pixels at 160 µm). The 24 µm detector is identical to one of the IRS short wavelength modules. The 70 µm detector uses gallium-doped germanium technology, and the 160 µm detector also uses gallium-doped germanium, but with mechanical stress added to each pixel to lower the bandgap and extend sensitivity to this long wavelength <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[123]</ref>.</p><p>The planned nominal mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply (360 liters at launch) was exhausted. This occurred on 15</p><p>May 2009. The two shortest wavelength modules of the IRAC camera are still operable in a "warm" (~ 30K) telescope so surveys will continue at reduced sensitivity in these wavebands only in the Spitzer Warm Mission.</p><p>Spitzer has several systematic errors that include pointing, background contamination, charge trapping, and detector fringing. One difficulty with Spitzer is that no on-board calibration exists to monitor the changes in the instrument systematic.

The short wavelength detectors are InSb devices, while the two longer wavelength detectors are Si:As devices.

Each FOV is seen simultaneously by two detectors (one InSb and one Si:As detector), fed through lenses and filters and through a beamsplitter. The arrays are read out via four readout amplifiers. Data are obtained simultaneously in all four arrays for all the frame times, regardless of whether only one or two FOVs were specified in the observing request, although the various channels may observe nearby, but separate, parts of the sky.</p><p>There are two components to IRAC: the cold assembly and the warm electronics.</p><p>The cold assembly primarily contains the detector arrays.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Dark Subtraction</head><p>The true dark current in the IRAC detectors is actually very low -the most notable dark current features are the electronic glows seen in the Si:As arrays (channels 3 &amp; 4).</p><p>There are two steps for the dark subtraction, one using a dark from the ground-based laboratory measurements (the so-called -lab dark‖), and another using a delta dark which is the difference between the lab dark and the sky dark measured at a low zodiacal background light region. The skydarks are taken in pre-determined regions which have been specifically chosen to be the darkest parts of the sky and are in regions that are relatively free of bright objects such as stars.    Bad Pixels and Optical Ghosts Hot pixels usually appear bright. These pixels have high dark currents and are usually isolated but sometimes in a clump. -Dead‖ pixels are really just very hot pixels, so hot that they saturate before the first pedestal sample. In a BCD image, hot pixels do not appear bright because they have been canceled by the labdark or skydark subtraction.</p><p>Most hot pixels appeared after launch and are the result of hits by energetic nuclei. By annealing the arrays, we restore most pixels that get activated. Some of them cannot be restored, and thus they become -permanent‖ hot pixels. Some pixels jump randomly from normal to high dark current and back, dwelling in one state for anywhere from a few minutes to weeks, so they may not be canceled by a skydark subtraction. These are IRAC's -rogue pixels‖.</p><p>There are three types of known or potential optical ghosts visible in IRAC images.</p><p>The brightest and most common ghosts are produced by internal reflections within the filters. Similar ghosts are created by internal reflections within the beamsplitters. These only affect channels 3 and 4 which are transmitted through the beamsplitters. The faintest identified ghosts appear as images of the Spitzer entrance pupil, i.e., the primary mirror shadowed by the secondary and supports. These pupil ghosts are only found in channels 2 and 4, and require an extremely bright source (e.g., a first magnitude star in a 12-second frame) to be seen due to their low surface brightnesses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Photometry and Calibration</head><p>IRAC is calibrated using both so-called primary and secondary calibrator stars. The primary stars are used to monitor long-term variations in the absolute calibration. They currently number 11 stars, are located in the continuous viewing zone (CVZ), and are thus observable year-round. They are observed once at the beginning, and once at the end of each campaign, i.e., about every 10 days whenever the instrument is switched on. The secondary calibrator stars are used to monitor short-term variations in the absolute calibration.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Point-Spread Function</head><p>Point Source Photometry using IRAC data is no different from that with any other high-quality astronomical data. Both aperture photometry and PSF-fitting can be tried.</p><p>Aperture photometry is most commonly used, so we will discuss it briefly. The radius of the on-source aperture should be chosen in such a way that it includes as much of the flux from the star (thus, greater than 2 arcseconds) as possible, but it should be small enough that a nearby background annulus can be used to accurately subtract unrelated diffuse emission, and that other point sources are not contributing to the aperture. For calibration stars, an annulus of 12 arcseconds is used; such a wide aperture will often not be possible for crowded fields. The dominant background in regions of low interstellar medium is zodiacal light, which is very smooth. In regions of significant interstellar emission, it is important to use a small aperture, especially in IRAC channels 3 and 4. The flux of a source can then be calculated in the standard way, taking the average over the background annulus, subtracting from the pixels in the on-source region, and then summing over the on-source region. Then, the measured brightness should be multiplied by the aperture corrections in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 4</ref>.1, ranging from 12% to 23% <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[125]</ref>.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">SExtractor analysis</head><p>SExtractor accepts images stored in FITS 2 format. The complete analysis of an image is done in two steps through the data. During the first step, a model of the sky background is built and a couple of global statistics are estimated. During the second step, the image is background-subtracted, filtered and thresholded -on-the-fly‖.</p><p>Detections are then deblended, photometered, classified and finally written to the output catalog (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.11).</p><p>The detection of sources is part of a process called segmentation in the imageprocessing vocabulary. Segmentation normally consists of identifying and separating image regions which have different properties (brightness, colour, texture...) or are delineated by edges. In the astronomical context, the segmentation process consists of separating objects from the sky background. This is however a somewhat imprecise definition, as astronomical sources have, on the images -and even often physicallyno clear boundaries, and may overlap. We shall therefore use the following working definition of an object in SExtractor: a group of pixels selected through some detection process and for which the flux contribution of an astronomical source is 2 Flexible Image Transport System 82 believed to be dominant over that of other objects. Note that this means that a simple x, y position vector alone cannot be handled by SExtractor as a detection.</p><p>Segmentation in SExtractor is achieved through a very simple thresholding process: a group of connected pixels that exceed some threshold above the background is identified as a detection. Each time an object extraction is completed, the connected set of pixels passes through a sort of filter that tries to split it into eventual overlapping components <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[126]</ref>. This case appears when the field is crowded, so does not occur for HD 209458. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Observations and Data Reduction</head><p>Three HD209458 primary transits were observed with the IRAC camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. Observing a transiting planet with Spitzer requires monitoring the target continuously without dithering, in order to be able to quantify the systematic effects described below:</p><p>-The amount of light detected in channels 1 and 2 will show variability that depends on the relative position of the source with respect to the pixel centre (see par. 4.2.3).</p><p>The time scale of this variation is of the order of 50 minutes. These effects have to be estimated from the data in order to evaluate the proper corrections to apply.</p><p>-In channels 3 and 4 there are only very minor pixel-scale effects, but a variation of the response of the pixels to a long period of illumination and latent build-up effect, affect the 5.8 and 8.0 μm observations, respectively.</p><p>-From previous observations with Spitzer (Beaulieu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[66]</ref>), it was noticed that the first 20 minutes were affected by a systematic effect that was different in nature to the ones affecting the subsequent hours of observation. There was an initial sharp decrease in signal, followed by a shallower one that was present in all the remaining observations. These pre and post transit data have been critical in the understanding of systematic effects. Accordingly, we obtained a slightly longer -pre-transit‖ data set, to let the satellite to settle in a -repeatable‖ jitter pattern and a shorter post-transit data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Ks is a near-infrared band centered on 2.17μm. This is the K magnitude from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS).</p><p>set. The time scale of the pixel-phase being of the order of 50 minutes, we chose a 120 min of pre-and 80 min of post-transit data baseline.</p><p>It is important to note that the ~ 184 minute transit of HD 209458b means that our data contain three full cycles of the pixel-scale phase variation in the transit itself,</p><p>giving an excellent opportunity to have a full control on the behavior of the systematic effects by evaluating them both in and outside the transit.</p><p>Our observations employed the IRAC 0.4/2 second stellar photometry mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Using the regular Astronomical Observation Templates (AOTs), a total of two transits per field of view is required to achieve the desired sensitivity at 4.5 (but we have just one epoch for it) and 5.8 μm (the arrays with the limiting sensitivity). Unfortunately, the AOTs as designed was not the most efficient way to perform this observation. Each stellar mode frame effectively incurs 8 seconds of overheads due to data transfer from the instrument to the spacecraft. As our observations only required the data in the field-of-view with the star, it was possible to save both data volume by collecting data in only two channels and with a cadence of 4 seconds. Consequently, we designed a special engineering template (Instrument Engineering Request; IER) to optimize the observations. IERs can typically double the efficiency (so that 1 epoch at 4.5 μm can be enough) and our IER enabled us to reduce the total required observing time for all four channels to only 13.4 hours (so at least 2 observations instead of 4).</p><p>We used the BCD files (see par. 4.2.2) provided by the Spitzer pipeline. Each channel has been treated separately (for a detailed discussion of the data reduction carried out by G. Campanella see <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[127]</ref>). We measured the flux of the target on each image using the SExtractor package (see par. 4.3), with a standard set of parameters for Spitzer. The centroid determination was done by PSF fitting. We performed both aperture photometry, and PSF fitting photometry. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.12, for all the six observed transits, we give the raw magnitude measurements, the variation of the centroid in X and Y axis, and the distance of the centroid from the lower left corner of the pixel (the pixel phase). A rapid inspection shows that all observations contain correlated noise of different nature, as expected when using the IRAC camera. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Estimating and Attenuation of Correlated Noise</head><p>Pixel-phase information is retrieved by using SExtractor's PSF fitting to obtain to the phases, in order to determine the best-fit dominant period, P phase (typically close to one hour, e.g. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig 4.13)</ref>. Having removed the pixel phase variation of X and Y with respect to time, as induced by spacecraft motion we obtain a robust determination of the second-order phase variations, which may then be fitted using a polynomial, of orders varying from 2 to 4 depending on the degree of curvature in the resultant phase trends. For channel 1 (epochs 1 and 2) and channel 2, we removed pixel-phase effects of r.m.s. amplitude 0.49, 1.51 and 0.57 mmag respectively. Channel 1 epoch 2, is particularly polluted by pixel phase response possibly due to a large inhomogeneity in response close to the PSF centroid position (pixel 131,128 of the detector).</p><p>In identifying the systematic trends present in the 5.8 μm data, we use 50-point median-stack smoothing of the out-of-transit data points, which provides a clearer view. The first epoch of 5.8 μm exhibits a discontinuity between the photometry at ~ 2800 seconds (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.14). The behaviour of the photometry in the regime 0 ≤ t ≤ 5500 seconds does not match either a -linear drift‖ usually associated with this channel, or a ‖ramp‖ style-effect. The origin of the observed behaviour is unclear and is present in many different trial aperture sizes, between 2.5 to 20 pixels radius, suggesting an instrumental effect located very close to the centroid position <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[127]</ref>.</p><p>The second epoch of 5.8 μm also, even if more subtly, exhibit a discontinuity between the photometry in the regime 0 ≤ t 2800 seconds, visible in the mediansmoothed lightcurve. Channel 3 seems to require a certain amount of time to settle into a stable regime. As a result, we can again treat this data by simply excluding the first ~ 30 minutes and then de-trend the remaining data. The ramp effect at 8 μm is well documented and so too is the methodology for correcting this phenomenon ( <ref type="bibr">Knutson et al.</ref> [78], Agol et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[69]</ref>). We fit a time trend</p><p>to the out-of-transit data of the form a+bt+c log(t−t 0 )+d(log(t−t 0 )) 2 where t 0 is chosen to be 32.7 seconds before the observations begin, which provides the best correction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Fitting the Transit Light Curves</head><p>Among the 6 transit light curves, we have four of high quality with well understood and corrected systematic effects: the first epoch at 3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, the second epoch at 5.8 μm and 8 μm. The second epoch at 3.6 μm and the first epoch at 5.8 μm will be treated separately.</p><p>Accurate limb darkening coefficients were calculated for each of the four IRAC bands following the procedure in Claret <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> (see Appendix B).We adopted the following stellar properties: T eff = 6100 K, log g = 4.38 and [Fe/H] = 0. The coefficients are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 4</ref>.3. We adopt the physical model of a transit light curve through the expressions of</p><p>Mandel &amp; Agol <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and orbital eccentricity using the equations of Kipping <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.We fit the data with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and prayer-bead Monte Carlo techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>As some physical parameters should be the same for all bands, we made a simultaneous fit to the best observations, namely 3.6 μm (epoch 1), 4.5 μm , 5.8 μm (epoch 2) and 8 μm, in which four parameters are shared by all channels: e, i, ω and a/R * . We decided to fit separately 3.6 μm (epoch 2), forcing the four shared parameters to be equal to the values derived from the best fit with the four other channels. We obtain extremely similar results concerning the transit depth for the different wavelengths with these techniques. The final results are listed in table 4.4. We asked for two epochs for HD 209458b at 3.6 and 5.8 μm with the prime intention of demonstrating the possibility of co-add multiple epoch observations, and/or be able to check for the variability in the system. The two epochs are separated by 7 months, and the observing setups are identical.</p><p>Firstly, at 3.6 μm the data are affected by systematic trends of the same nature due to the pixel scale effect. We notice a factor 3 in the amplitude of the systematic trends between the two epochs. The results are compatible between the two channels.</p><p>Secondly, at 5.8 μm the situation is more complex. The second epoch showed the expected behaviour, and we have been able to correct for systematics, and to fit it. In the first epoch systematic trends affect the measurements up to the mid transit. We took a conservative approach here, excluding the data up to the mid-transit. We made a fit adopting the physical parameters (i, a/R * ) reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 4</ref>.4. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.15 we compare epoch 1 data and the model fitted on the data from the mid-transit.</p><p>Inspection of the residuals after the mid-transit indicates a good fit to the data. The data from the first half of the observations show the uncorrected systematic trends at work. We measure the two transit depth to be 1.552 ± 0.032% and 1.549 ± 0.015% for epoch 1 and epoch 2 respectively. The results are compatible between the two channels. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7">Data Interpretation</head><p>Our analysis includes the effects of water, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, pressure-induced absorption of H 2 −H 2 . We do not consider the presence of particulates, because there is no indication of particles large enough (~ 3μm ) to affect the planet's middle-infrared spectrum (see Beaulieu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> for more details). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.16, we show the contribution of the different molecules combined to water.</p><p>The 3.6 μm (and to a lesser degree the one at 8 μm) IRAC channel measurement can be affected by the presence of methane. By contrast, CO 2 and CO may contribute in the passband at 4.5 μm. We find absorption by water alone can explain the spectral characteristics of the photometric measurements, which probe pressure levels from 1 to 0.001 bars (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_69">Fig. 4</ref>.17). The determined water abundance depends on the assumed temperature profile and planetary radius. We find that the data can be interpreted, e.g., with a thermochemical equilibrium water abundance of 4.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE SEARCH FOR EXOMOONS</head><p>An exomoon is a smaller, natural satellite that orbits an extrasolar planet. As the number of known exoplanets continues to grow, the question as to whether such bodies frequently host satellites has become one of increasing interest.</p><p>At the time of writing, no detection of an exomoon has ever been made but this is most probably due to a selection effect of the insensitivity of current methods. As many of the planets of own solar system host satellites and since some of the most promising candidates for extraterrestrial habitable locations within our own solar system are the moons of gas giants (see par. 3.3.2), for example Europa (Reynolds et al.</p><p>[129], Marion et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[130]</ref>) and Enceladus (Spencer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[102]</ref>), we think that the search for exomoons will offer exciting developments and almost certainly it will take a more prominent role in future astronomy.</p><p>The theory of exomoon detection begun with <ref type="bibr">Sartoretti &amp; Schneider [131]</ref> proposing the use of transit timing. This theory was developed further by <ref type="bibr">Szabo et al.</ref> [132],</p><p>Simon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[133]</ref> and most recently by <ref type="bibr">Kipping ([134]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[135]</ref>).</p><p>The detection of exomoons would have a number of implications:</p><p>1. It could help to understand how important the Moon was to life on the Earth (influence on geological activities, rotation axis and tidal effects). In fact, several authors ( <ref type="bibr">Waltham [136]</ref>, Lathe <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[137]</ref>) suggest that complex life may not form on planets without large moons. So even if we detect an Earth-like planet in the future, the search for a moon around such a body may be critical in assessing its habitability. 3. It could expand the number of rocky and icy bodies we know.</p><p>4. There may be more habitable exomoons than exoplanets. In support of this view, Scharf <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[141]</ref> suggested exomoons could support habitable environments even outside of the conventional habitable zone due to tidal heating from the host planet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_88">Figure 5</ref>.1: Enceladus and Europa, the most promising candidates for hosting extraterrestrial life within the solar system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Proposed Detection Methods</head><p>Despite the great successes of planet hunters with Doppler spectroscopy of the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, exomoons cannot be found with this technique. This is because the resultant shifted stellar spectra due to the presence of a planet plus additional satellites would behave identically to a single point-mass moving in orbit of the host star. <ref type="bibr">Cabrera &amp; Schneider [144]</ref> argue that if the emitted light of an exoplanet could be measured, then</p><p>Doppler spectroscopy of the planet itself could be achieved which would allow for satellite detection. However, achieving high spectral resolutions of light from a planet alone remains a challenging prospect.</p><p>In recognition of this, there have been several other methods proposed for detecting exomoons; we are now going to present some of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Direct imaging</head><p>Direct imaging even an exoplanet is extremely challenging due to the large difference in brightness between the objects and the small angular size of the planet. These problems are exacerbated for small exomoons. Even if a coronographic or interferometric technique can be utilised to extinguish the star light, the moon light must still compete with the planetary light. The most significant difficulty is therefore likely to be achieving an angular resolution sufficient to resolve the two objects. At a distance of 10pc, the Moon-Earth separation is 0.5 mas whereas the current best interferometric precision in exoplanet astronomy is ~ 25 mas <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[142]</ref>. Therefore, one would need at least two coronographic telescopes combined with an interferometer in order to image such systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[143]</ref> and there exists no such design in planning. Ergo, direct imaging is not a feasible detection method at present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Pulsar timing</head><p>In 2008, Lewis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[145]</ref> proposed using pulsar timing to detect the moons of pulsar planets. The authors applied their method to the case of PSR B1620-26 b and found that a stable moon orbiting this planet could be detected, if the moon had a separation of about one fiftieth of that of the orbit of the planet around the pulsar, and a mass ratio to the planet of 5% or larger. Perhaps it would not be surprising if the first exomoon was found through this method given that the first exoplanet was discovered around a pulsar star by Wolszczan &amp; Frail <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Microlensing</head><p>In 2002, Han &amp; Han <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[146]</ref> proposed that microlensing could be used to detect the moons of extrasolar planets. While a space mission concept like Euclid could detect exomoons <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[103]</ref>, microlensed planets and moons could not be followed up due to their great distances from the Earth and thus characterising these moons would be unlikely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Occultation</head><p>If a planet and a moon passed in front of a host star, both objects should produce a dip in the observed light <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[133]</ref>. Using this technique, Brown et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> were able to set an upper limit of 1.2 R⊕ for an orbiting exomoon around HD209458b.</p><p>To date, the smallest transiting planet discovered is still Neptune-sized, Gliese 436b.</p><p>An exomoon is likely to be sub-Earth sized, based upon our Solar System, and so even a specialized transit space-based telescope like COROT or Kepler will struggle to spot the signature <ref type="bibr">(Sartoretti &amp; Schneider [131]</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, the occultation method does suffer from the problem that a -lucky‖ detection is required. The exomoon could well be hiding in front of behind the planet the moment of transit. Another way of putting this is that the modal position of the moon's lightcurve perfectly coincides with the planetary lightcurve, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Cabrera &amp; Schneider [144]</ref>. This means one would likely require multiple transits in order to see just one clean moon transit. After this one moon transit had been observed, the whole process would need to repeat several times in order to show that the event was not a statistical fluke or some form of noise.</p><p>As an example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_88">figure 5</ref>.2 there is shown the transit lightcurve of a planet with r p = r Jup and T P = 50 days and a satellite with r s = 2.5 r⊕ and T S = 0.5days. The stellar flux shows a marked but moderate decrease at t = −5 hr, as the satellite first transits in front of the star. When the planet also starts to transit, at t = −3.5 hr, the stellar flux drops more abruptly. Soon after, at t = −1 hr, the relative flux maximum produced by the planet-satellite transit appears clearly. Then, the stellar flux sharply increases as the planet leaves the star, and the satellite, which now follows the planet, continues to moderately occult the star from about t = 3.5 to 4.5 hr. Also shown by crosses are the results of simulated 10 min exposure observations with a Poisson noise of 10 −4 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Transit timing effects</head><p>If a satellite does not produce a detectable signal in the stellar lightcurve, it may still be detected indirectly through the associated rotation of the planet around the barycentre of the planet-satellite system. This requires that a planetary transit be observed at least 3 times, as the effect of the rotation will be a periodical time shift of the lightcurve minima induced by the planet transits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Transit time variation (TTV)</head><p>We consider the simple case where:</p><p> the planet-moon orbital plane is co-aligned with the planet-star orbital plane at i = 90°.</p><p> both the planet and the moon are on a circular orbit.</p><p>In this case, the projected diameter of the planet orbit around the barycentre of the planet-satellite system is Unfortunately, transit timing variation can also be provoked by a multitude of phenomenon, including gravitational influence of other planets in the system or companion stars, general relativistic precession of the orbit, tidal deformations of both the star and the planet, torques due to spin-induced quadrupole moment of the star, stellar peculiar motion and parallax effects <ref type="bibr">(Kipping [143]</ref>). Due to the rich plethora of phenomenon that could cause TTV, claiming any observed signal was indeed due to a moon would be extremely challenging.</p><p>Another critical problem with TTV from an exomoon is that the period of an exomoon must always be much smaller than the period of the host exoplanet, due to stability arguments outlined by Kipping <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[134]</ref>. As a result, the observed signal will always be under-sampled and have a frequency above the Nyquist frequency. This means that it would be impossible to deduce an accurate period for the exomoon; only a list of possible harmonic frequencies could be derived. The subsidiary effect is that since the TTV amplitude is proportional to the mass and to the orbital distance of the moon, then it is also impossible to derive the mass of the exomoon through TTV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Transit duration variation (TDV)</head><p>Transit duration variation (TDV) is the periodic change in the duration of a transit (τ) over many measurements.</p><p>We have that the duration of a transit is inversely proportional to the projected velocity of the planet across the star, P v  :   The orbital inclinations of the planet (i = 90°) and exomoon do not vary from orbit to orbit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">1 P v   <label>(</label></formula><p> We do not consider additional perturbing bodies in the system.</p><p>We obtain that any transit duration variation is solely due to the variation of the velocity. Moreover, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[134]</ref> that the rms amplitude of the TDV signal, δ TDV , has the following proportionality: In the more general case of i ≤ 90° and an exomoon inclined from the planet-star plane, the TDV effect due to an exomoon has two major constituents: one due to the velocity variation effect (V) already described and one new component due to transit impact parameter variation (TIP). The TIP-component is due to the planet moving between higher and lower impact parameters as a result of the wobbling (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_88">Fig. 5</ref>.5).</p><p>Moreover, it is ∝ a S M S , which is the same as TTV's proportionality. A summary of the properties of the three known transit timing effects due to an exomoon can be seen in    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">TTV &amp; TDV as complementary methods</head><p>The introduction of TDV allows for the precise measurement of M S without any assumption on the orbital separation. In fact, using equations (5.2) and (5.4) we can directly measure the orbital separation of the exomoon a S and hence M S .</p><p>Another major advantage of TDV is that the signal should lag TTV by a π/2 phase difference, originating from the fact TTV is a spatial effect whereas TDV is a velocity effect. Unfortunately, in the case i = 90° the direction and value of the phase shift remains unchanged between prograde and retrograde satellites <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[134]</ref>.</p><p>Combining TTV and TDV should allow for a much more significant confirmation of a potential exomoon than just using TTV alone. The phase difference can be seen in the example waveforms in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_88">figure 5</ref>.6, where there are plotted the TTV and TDV waveforms due to a hypothetical exomoon of 1M⊕ around a GJ436b for e S = 0, 0.3 and 0.6 (i = 90°). The orbital radius of any satellite around a planet must lie somewhere between the Hill radius R H and the Roche limit d min to maintain stability. So, a S can be expressed by assuming that it is equal to some fraction χ of the Hill radius: s H a R   In <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 5</ref>.2, there are evaluated the TTV and TDV (both V-&amp; TIP-components)</p><p>rms amplitudes for a variety of known transiting planets in the case of a 1M⊕</p><p>exomoon with χ = 1/3 and e S = 0. We can deduce that the TDV-V signal is of a similar order of magnitude to the TTV signal while TDV-TIP effect is often an order of magnitude less than the V-component. Moreover, the timing signal of Neptunemass host planets should be between 10 and 20 seconds. With some current ground based instruments reaching 7 seconds, for example Johnson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[147]</ref>, and the Kepler mission expected to achieve second accuracy then large exomoons can be already detectable. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4">An Earth-like habitable exomoon</head><p>One interesting hypothetical example to reflect on is an Earth-like exomoon around a</p><p>Neptune-like planet. Consider a system like GJ436 but with a transiting planet which has a period of T P = 35.7 days and is on a circular orbit (i = 90°). This would put the planet into the habitable zone of GJ436 with Teq ≃ 300K. Although the Neptune-like planet itself would not be an ideal place to search for life, an Earth mass exomoon would be. Suppose there is a 1M⊕ exomoon with this planet on a circular orbit, χ=0.25 and hence P S ≃ 2.5 days and the planet-moon orbital plane is coaligned to the star-planet orbital plane, then the predicted rms TTV amplitude would be 138s and the TDV amplitude would be 60s <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[134]</ref>. For GJ436b, Alonso et al.</p><p>[148] used the 1.52m</p><p>Carlos Sanchez telescope and achieved a timing accurateness of ∼ 13 seconds and a duration error of ∼ 50 seconds. This suggests that the detection of the exomoon should be presently possible through TTV from the ground and feasible with TDV in the near future. This illustrates that even ground-based instruments could detect an</p><p>Earth-like body in the habitable zone using timing effects. but the detection of a moon outside our own solar system remains a challenge to current astronomical instrumentation. The Kepler Mission, while designed to detect</p><p>Earth-like planets, is expected to detect many more gas giants. If such bodies harboured extrasolar moons, such planets should exhibit timing deviations in each transit.</p><p>As part of my work at UCL, we have estimated the maximum detectable range of exomoons that the Kepler Mission or Kepler-class photometry (KCP) could detect through transit timing effects, with particular attention to the exciting prospect of habitable-zone moons around gas giant planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The question as to whether current telescopes can detect exomoons could have farreaching implications for the future of exoplanet science. Probably, exomoons could be common habitable environments in the galaxy and would therefore be of great interest to astrobiologists. Our work shows that exomoons are indeed already quite detectable with KCP. We emphasise the use of Kepler-class photometry due to the increasingly remarkable results being achieved from the ground which are matching space-based photometry, for example Johnson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[150]</ref>. In addition, groundbased observations are often more ideally suited for transit-timing studies due to the fewer constrictions placed on the system, such as telemetry-limited data-download speeds.</p></div>

Our hypotheses are here described:</p><p> Only one exomoon exists around the gas giant exoplanet of interest.</p><p> The moon and planet are both on circular orbits and the moon's orbit is prograde.</p><p> The moon's orbital plane is coaligned to that of the planet-star plane which is itself perpendicular to the line-of-sight of the observer, i.e. i = 90°.</p><p> If a planet is within the habitable zone, then any moon around that planet may also be considered to be habitable.</p><p> A transiting planet must be detected to 8-σ confidence to be accepted as genuine.</p><p> An exomoon must be detected through either 1) TTV to 8-σ and TDV to 3-σ confidence or 2) TTV to 3-σ and TDV to 8-σ confidence, in order to be accepted as authentic.</p><p> The Kepler Mission or KCP will be used in high cadence mode for the transit timing of a target of interest for ≃ 4 years.</p><p> n = M/P P where M is the mission duration and P P is the period of transiting planet.</p><p> At least three transits are needed to detect both a planet and a moon.</p><p>In most of the cases we will consider, many more than three transits will be detected and three can be seen to be the limiting case for G0V stars, where the habitable zone is sufficiently distant to only permit three transits in a 4-year timespan. Although statistically speaking three transits is sufficient, there is a risk of an outlier producing a false positive. We then consider detections of habitable exomoons in early G-type star systems to be described as -tentative‖, whereas once four transits are detected, for stars of spectral type G5V and later, this risk can be considered to be reduced.</p><p>The nominal mission length of Kepler is 3.5 years and it may be extended to up to 6 years, which justifies our choice of 4 years of transit timing observations. A groundbased search achieving KCP may easily be operational for 4 years or more. We choose 8-σ as the signal detection threshold since this is the same as that used by <ref type="bibr">Kepler [36]</ref>.</p><p>The second signal may be detected to lower significance since it is only used to confirm the phase difference between the two and also derive the exomoon period.</p><p>The analytic expressions we need are: 2. For the purposes of TDV measurements, the primary requirement is to use a measure of transit duration which has the lowest possible uncertainty. Carter et al.</p><p>[151] derived analytic expressions for the uncertainty on the mid-transit time (t c ) and duration (T) which consider the transit duration to be defined as the time taken for the planet to move between contact points 1.5 to 3.5 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 6.1</ref>). This is in contrast to the definition used by Seager &amp; Mallén-Ornelas <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, for example, who consider t T as being the duration between contact points 1 &amp; 4 and t F as the duration between contact points 2 &amp; 3 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2.6</ref>). By calculating the covariances of the lightcurve, it can be shown that T can be calculated more precisely than either t T or t F and so we select T as a robust duration parameter to investigate the TDV effect. So the equations that we use for the uncertainties on transit depth d, transit duration T and mid-transit time t C are <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[151]</ref>: 3. For a normal transit depth observed n times, the confidence C to which the transit is detected, in terms of the number of standard deviations, is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 d Wd    (6.1) 1 2 T WT    (6.2)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">photometric d d C n  </formula><p>(6.6) In contrast, for TTV and TDV signals, which are periodic in nature with a frequency always much higher than the sampling frequency, we search for statistically significant excess variance and the 2  -distribution to calculate the confidence in a frequentist formulation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">2 1 2 2 1 , 1 2 2 time n n C erf Q                             (6.7)</formula><p>where Instrument noise is due to a variety of effects and has been modelled in depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to quantify its effect as a function of magnitude.

We also note that (6.8) is equivalent to the formulation used in the original technical design papers for Kepler (e.g. equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(1)</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>).  Properties of host star</p><p>In our study, we just consider single main-sequence stars because they offer the best potential for hosting habitable environments. We consider spectral types from M5V to F0V and assume for each an approximate mass, radius and effective temperature as given by <ref type="bibr">Cox [21]</ref>, and a luminosity derived from data therein. We use the Kepler bandpass (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Fig. 6</ref>.3) to calculate the absolute magnitude M Kep of these stars.</p><p>For each stellar type, we assume the stars are not young and may be considered to be slow rotators. Since stellar variability is correlated to rotational period (see Dorren et al.</p><p>[154]), we therefore limit ourselves to quiet stars. This is the same assumption used for</p><p>Kepler's ability to detect Earth-like planets since very active stars will be too variable for the detection of such bodies. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 6</ref>.1 we list the different star properties. We choose to consider a moon-hosting gas-giant exoplanet around the variety of main-sequence stars shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 6</ref>.1. For each star we calculate the habitable zone orbital distance a hab , to be defined as the distance where a planet would receive the same insolation as the Earth. This straightforwardly permits a reasonable estimation of the habitable zone for each star type.</p><p>(6.9)</p><p>For each planet-moon system we consider, the period of the transiting planet is calculated using Kepler's Third Law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">3 * 2 () hab hab PS a P G M M M    (6.10)</formula><p>We choose to work in the time domain, rather than the orbital-distance formulation, since a major limiting factor in our study is the Kepler Mission duration.  If this value is greater than 2R P we use the Roche limit as the minimum distance, otherwise 2R P is adopted (i. e. 2 IP aR  in every scenario considered). We assume that in the range of allowed values, there is no reason for a moon to exist at any particular value of ξ and thus the prior distribution is flat. </p></div>

This is a reasonable assumption for high quality photometry with large amounts of out-of-transit data.</p><p>The fitting code finds the best-fit to the lightcurve by utilising a genetic algorithm, PIKAIA <ref type="bibr">(Metcalfe &amp; Charbonneau [159]</ref>), to get close to a minimum in 2  .</p><p>In fact, genetic algorithms (GA) are a class of heuristic search techniques that apply basic evolutionary operators in a computational setting, this makes them well suited to search for the region of parameter-space that contains the global minimum. The central idea is to solve an optimization problem by evolving the global solution, starting with an initial set of purely random guesses. The GA evaluates the model for each set of parameters, and the predictions are compared to observations. Each point in the -population‖ of trials is subsequently assigned a fitness based on the relative quality of the match. A new generation of sample points is then created by selecting from the current population of points according to their computed fitness, and then modifying their defining parameter values with two genetic operators in order to explore new regions of parameter-space.</p><p>The two basic genetic operators are crossover, which emulates sexual reproduction, and mutation which emulates somatic defects. The crossover procedure pairs up the strings, chooses a random position for each pair, and swaps the two strings from that position to the end. The mutation operator spontaneously replaces a digit in the string with a new randomly chosen value.</p><p>Under the -pressure‖ of fitness-based selection, crossover acting on successive generations of strings modifies the frequency of a given substring in the population at a rate proportional to the difference between the mean fitness of the subset of strings incorporating that substring, and the mean fitness of all strings making up the current population. So, the GA can be thought of as a classifier system that continuously sorts out and combines the most advantageous substrings that happen to be present across the whole population at a given time. In this context the role of mutation is to inject -novelty‖ continuously, by producing new digit values at specific string positions, which might not otherwise have been present in the population or may have been selected against during earlier evolutionary phases.</p><p>The approximate solution from PIKAIA is then used as a starting point for a 2  -minimisation performed with the AMOEBA routine (Press et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[157]</ref>).</p><p>The AMOEBA algorithm, originally published in 1965 by <ref type="bibr">Nelder and Mead [160]</ref>, is designed to solve the classical unconstrained optimization problem of minimizing a given nonlinear function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Earth-transit magnitude limit</head><p>The first question that we would like to address is about the magnitude limit in detecting an Earth-like transit with KCP. For each spectral type in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 6</ref>.1, we are able to compute the faintest visual magnitude to which a habitable Earth-like transit can be detected. Kepler was conceived with the goal of detecting an Earth-Sun transit of 6.5 hours in duration, which represents about half the duration if the Earth has an impact parameter of zero. However, the maximum magnitude to which an Earth-like transit could be detected will be for the cases of equatorial transits (b = 0, i = 90°) as these maximise the transit duration and hence integration time. We establish the following criteria for a reliable transit detection:</p><p>• Each transit must be detected to ≥ 1-σ confidence.</p><p>• The fold lightcurve must have a significance of ≥ 8-σ.</p><p>• The time between contact points 2 &amp; 3 ≥ 1 hour, in order to be detected with</p><p>Kepler's survey-mode cadence of 30 minutes.</p><p>• At least 3 transits must be detected over the mission duration.</p><p>With these criteria, we calculate the magnitudes of the faintest stars hosting a habitable, transiting Earth which can be detected with KCP, for both full transit durations (i.e. equatorial transits) and half-durations (i.e. impact parameter chosen to be such that the transit duration is half the full transit). The results are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 6</ref>.3.</p><p>As expected, smaller host stars can be fainter due to their smaller radius and hence deeper transit depths. We also collect more transits towards smaller stars since the orbital period of the habitable Earth decreases.</p><p>Even if Kepler was extended to a mission length of 6 years, an F5V star would have a habitable zone so far out that detecting three transits within this region would be impossible. Ergo, we do not consider F type stars in our analysis. Moreover, considering 6 th -magnitude stars as the bright limit, we can calculate d min , the minimum distance for each spectral type which avoid the saturation of the CCDs. </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F5V - - - - F0V - - - -</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">Jupiters vs Saturns vs Neptunes</head><p>We now use the approximate analytic expressions to get a feel on the general trends in exomoon detection. The first question we would like to ask is what is the optimum planet to search for moons around, out of the three classes of Neptunes, Saturns and Jupiters? We take each of these planets and simulate the detectability of the TTV signal as a function of planetary orbital period P P , for an 0.2M⊕ exomoon with a S = 0.4895 R H . We fix the star to be a G2V, m Kep = 12 object and work with i = 90° for simplicity.</p><p>We calculate the signal amplitude and mid-transit time uncertainty in all cases and hence find the 2  value for a range of orbital periods. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.10, we plot 2  as a function of host planet's orbital period. The plot reveals that Jupiters are the hardest to search for exomoons around whilst Saturns are the easiest. This is due to Saturn's low density meaning a large transit depth but a low enough mass such that an exomoon still affects it significantly. We find the same order of detectability consistently in many different orbital configurations and for TDV as well. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.3">ξ-m Kep parameter space</head><p>We now consider an exomoon in the optimum condition of a Saturn hosting a single satellite in the habitable zone of the host star. The detectability of the timing signals depends on the planet-moon separation SH aR   , the apparent magnitude of the host star in the Kepler bandpass m Kep , mass of the exomoon M S and finally the host star's mass and radius (i.e. spectral type).</p><p>TDV increases with lower values of and TTV increases with higher values of  (see eqs. 5.2, 5.4), but we must maintain a balance such that at least one of the effects is detected to 8-σ and the other to 3-σ confidence (dictated by our previous detection criteria). To find the limits of interest, we assume a zero-impact-parameter transit of our optimum planet-moon arrangement. The orbital period of the host planet is always given by P hab . We prefer to calculate this best-case scenario since we may then consider it unfeasible to detect habitable moons beyond this limit.</p><p>For a given star type and exomoon mass, we plot the contours of m Kep and ξ which provide TTVs of 3-and 8-σ confidence and then repeat for TDVs of the same confidences. There are two possible acceptance criteria (see par. 6.1): 1) TTV confidence is ≥ 3-σ and TDV confidence is ≥ 8-σ; 2) TTV confidence is ≥ 8-σ and TDV confidence is ≥ 3-σ. The loci of points below these lines represents the potential detection parameter space. For each star type and exomoon mass, these loci will be different. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_18">Table 6</ref>.4 we show the data of interest in the case of 13 S MM   and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.11 we plot an example for an M0V-type star.</p><p>There are certain cases which constrain the stars of interest. given by the fact we require three transits in a 4 year observation duration and thus the most distant habitable zone assumed here corresponds to a period of 1.33 years, which excludes the F0V and F5V stellar types.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.11: Detectable range of a habitable 1/3 M⊕ exomoon for an M0V star with respect to apparent magnitude and ξ parameter space.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.4">Minimum detectable habitable exomoon masses</head><p>Assuming that the probability distribution of exomoons with respect to ξ is approximately flat between ξ min and ξ max , we can easily calculate the magnitude limits to detect 25%, 50% or 75% of the exomoons in the given sample. For the case shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.11, the quartile values are m Kep = 12.0, 11.5 and 10.9 respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Fig.   6</ref>.12). This means that for a M0V star of m Kep = 12.0 there is a 25% probability of detecting a 1/3 M⊕ exomoon orbiting a Saturn-like planet in the habitable zone. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.12: Minimum detectable exomoon mass around a Saturn-like planet host in the habitable zone of an M0V star. The top line is the 75% catch-rate, the middle is 50% and the lowest is for a 25% exomoon catch-rate.</p><p>We may then calculate these quartile values for different exomoon masses and various star types. Effectively, we are able to determine the minimum detectable exomoon mass as a function of magnitude for three different detection yields: i) 25%, ii) 50%, and iii) 75%. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.13, we plot the minimum detectable exomoon mass,  If we set a lower limit of 10 pc for our target star, then the lowest-mass habitablezone exomoon which could be detected with KCP around a M2V star will be 0.18M⊕ which is below the stability limit of 0.41 M⊕. We therefore conclude that the minimum detectable habitable-zone exomoon mass with KCP is ~ 0.2 M⊕.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.5">Detectability of a 1 M⊕ habitable exomoon and of an Earth-Moon analogue</head><p>For the 25% detection yield case, we can convert the magnitude limit for detecting a 1 M⊕ habitable exomoon into a distance limit by making use of the absolute magnitudes for each star type. The distance limit for detecting a 1 M⊕ habitable exomoon may then be compared to the limit found for a transiting 1 R⊕ habitable exoplanet (see par. 6.3.1). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.14, we compare the two distance limits, which reveals that the distance limit for moons takes the same shape as the transit limit but is ~ 1.6 times lower. This translates to a volume space diminished by a factor of ~ 4.</p><p>So, assuming that there are about 10 5 useable stars in Kepler's field of view, we estimate roughly that 25,000 stars would be within range for habitable-exomoon detection. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_98">Figure 6</ref>.14: Distance limit for detecting a 1 M⊕ habitable exomoon (solid) and a 1 R⊕ exoplanet (dotdashed) as a function of stellar mass, for main sequence stars. We assume a Saturn-like planet as the host for the exomoon case. We also mark the lower stellar mass stability limit of ∼ 0.475 M⊙ and the upper mass limit of ∼ 1 M⊙ imposed by the requirement to observe ≥ 3 transits. The drop at 0.9 M⊙ is due to Phab becoming longer.</p><p>To conclude, we consider the detectability of an Earth-Moon system. Using the orbital parameters of the Sun-Earth-Moon system and assuming the most favourable configuration of i = 90°, we find the Earth would exhibit a TTV r.m.s. amplitude of 112.4 seconds and a TDV of 13.7 seconds. The TDV is particularly low due to the large value of ξ = 0.26 for the Moon.</p><p>In comparison, KCP of a V = 6 star would yield timing errors of σ tc = 389.6 seconds and σ T = 779.2 seconds. So, even for the most favourable case the TTV has a signal-to-noise of 0.3, which makes it undetectable. We therefore conclude that KCP cannot detect a Sun-Earth-Moon analogue through transit timing effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Since 1995, the search for exoplanets has imposed itself like one of the most dynamic research fields. As a matter of fact, we can count more than 80 ground-based and 20</p><p>space-based ongoing programs and future projects. More than 370 exoplanets are now known thanks mostly to indirect detection techniques. This number is due to increase exponentially in the near future thanks to the improved capabilities of the groundbased telescopes and space-missions devoted to the detection of exoplanets.</p><p>One of them, already operational, is the Kepler mission. The purpose of a mission like Kepler is to monitor ~100,000 solar-type stars for four years in order to get statistical data on the population and distribution of occurrence of Earth analogs and of larger-size planets as well.</p><p>In the first decade, the task was to find more and more of these astronomical bodies.</p><p>In recent years, attention has switched from finding planets to characterizing them.</p><p>Among the variety of exoplanets discovered, particular attention is being devoted to those planets that transit their parent star. For these objects planetary and orbital parameters such as eccentricity, inclination, radius, mass, are known, allowing first order characterization on the bulk composition and temperature. Most significantly, it is possible to use the wavelength dependence of this extinction to identify key chemical components in the planetary atmosphere, which opens up enormous possibilities in terms of exoplanet characterization.</p><p>As an example of atmospheric characterization we have presented the IRAC photometry data recording the primary transit of HD209458b in four infrared bands.</p><p>We have corrected the systematics and performed Monte Carlo fits. Our results are consistent with the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere of HD209458b. It is possible that additional molecules, such as CH 4 , CO and/or CO 2 are also present, but the lack of spectral resolution of our data have prevented these from being detected. Additional data in transmission at different wavelengths and/or higher will be required to gain information about these other molecules.</p><p>Whilst significant advances have been made in the field of understanding the atmospheres of hot Jupiters, we have to wait for results from Kepler and then from JWST in order to begin the characterization of terrestrial planets and investigate the possibility for them to harbour life. In fact, while within our own Solar System the search for extraterrestrial life and evidence about the origin of earthly life will likely be confined to Europa, Enceladus and Titan; the advantages of studies beyond the Solar System are the greater diversities of both planetary environments and their stages of development that are available for investigation.</p><p>Moreover, many other planetary attributes remain a mystery for us. One example is the question as to whether exoplanets frequently host satellites, as many of the planets of own solar system do. We have presented a model for the TTV and TDV signals, by employing transit time variation (TTV) and transit duration variation (TDV) in combination, it is possible to not only identify exomoons but also derive their mass and orbital separation from the host planet. Once the period, mass and ephemeris of an exomoon can be determined using these techniques, it should be possible to scrutinise the lightcurve and search for the dip in light due to the moon itself which would ultimately reveal the exomoon radius.</p><p>We have also shown that current ground-based telescopes could detect a 1M⊕ exomoon in the habitable zone around a Neptune-like exoplanet. So, the natural subsequent question was about the possibilities that the Kepler Mission would offer in this search.</p><p>Our analysis finds that habitable exomoons are detectable up to ∼ 100-200 pc away around early-M, K and later-G dwarf stars with the Kepler Mission or photometry of equal quality (KCP). This photometric quality should be sensitive down to 0.2M⊕ habitable exomoons in the idealised cases and could survey ∼ 10 6 stars for 1M⊕</p><p>habitable exomoons, with a full Galactic Plane survey. This number is around 25,000 stars for Kepler's field-of-view.</p><p>We find that Saturn-like planets are the ideal host candidates for detection due to their large radius to mass ratio. Additionally, we find lower-mass exomoons may be found around M-dwarfs due to the closer habitable zone permitting a larger number of transits in a 4-year window.</p><p>The exciting prospect of discovering a habitable exomoon is well within the grasp of KCP and whether such worlds exist or whether they will be classed as truly habitable worlds are questions we can hope to answer in the coming years. It is interesting to note that ∼ 0.2M⊕ is the minimum habitable mass for a planet or moon proposed by several authors. Moreover, it has been proposed that the habitable zone could be extended for exomoons due to tidal heating and so our calculations may infact be an underestimate.</p><p>We find that Kepler will be incapable of finding Ganymede-mass moons around</p><p>Saturn-like planets. If the maximum moon mass which could form from a planetary debris disk is 2 × 10 −4 of that of the primary's, as happen in the Solar System, unlikely KCP would detect any moons which formed around a planet in such a way.</p><p>Nevertheless, moons above this mass limit are still dynamically stable and could have been captured by a planet or formed through an impact, for example like the formation of Triton and the Moon respectively. Whether or not such objects are common is unknown but KCP could make the first in-depth search.</p><p>Our results suggest it is easier to detect an Earth-like exoplanet than an Earth-like exomoon around a gas giant. However, we have no statistics to draw upon to estimate which of these scenarios is more common. If a roughly equal number of both are discovered, it would indicate that the latter is more common due to the detection bias.</p><p>All these results highlight the promising opportunity of making the first exomoon detection using the Kepler telescope, or photometry of equivalent quality, especially the feasibility of detecting habitable-zone exomoons. CLARET'S COEFFICIENTS FOR LIMB-DARKENING FUNCTIONS Claret <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> has found that the most accurate functions that can describe the limbdarkening of main-sequence stars are the quadratic and the -nonlinear" law.

Given a value for: the rotation velocity of the star VT, its surface gravity g, its effective temperature T eff and metallicity M, each model returns the 2, 4 coefficients to be used in the quadratic and the -nonlinear" law respectively.

The Einstein radius is the angular radius of the Einstein ring in the event of perfect alignment. It depends on the lens mass M, the distance of the lens d L , and the distance of the source d S : (in radians) (2.9) For M equal to the mass of the Sun, d L = 4 kpc and d S = 8 kpc (typical for a Bulge microlensing event), the Einstein radius is 1 mas.</figDesc></figure>

For instance, in Figure 3.6, it is shown the additional contribution of a variety of plausible molecules as a function of wavelength: the contributions of Methane at 3.2 μm, CO at 4.5 μm and ammonia at 11 μm are quite noticeable. Although water can be detected with broad band photometry, it is clear that spectral resolution is needed in order to get the probe for the different species [4].</figDesc></figure>

Other plausible solvents cannot match the strong polar-nonpolar dichotomy that water maintains with certain organic substances, and this dichotomy is essential for maintaining stable biomolecular and cellular structures [176]. However, our own biosphere utilizes only a small fraction of the number of potentially useful organic compounds. Alien life forms probably explored alternative possibilities and so their discovery will increase the known diversity of life. Hence, what signatures one would look for in the case of an habitable planet? During the 1960s as a result of work for NASA concerned with detecting life on Mars [177], Lovelock formulated the Gaia hypothesis proposing that living and non- living parts of the earth, the biosphere, form a complex interacting system that has a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that acts to sustain life [178][179].</figDesc></figure>

It concerned the observation of the primary transit of HD 209458b at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 μm using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The extrasolar planet HD 209458b orbits a main sequence G star at 0.046 AU (period 3.52 days). It was the first exoplanet for which repeated transits across the stellar disk were observed (~ 1.5% absorption; Charbonneau et al. [14]). Using radial velocity measurements (Mazeh et al. [109]), the planet's mass and radius were able to be determined (M p ~ 0.69M Jup , R p ~ 1.4R Jup ), confirming the planet is a gas giant with one of the lowest densities so far discovered. Consequently it must have a very extended atmosphere making it one of the optimum candidates for observation using primary transit techniques, and it was indeed the first exo-atmosphere probed successfully using this method in the visible (Charbonneau et al. [60]) and more recently in the IR (Richardson et al. [110]). Following the work on HD 189733b where the first detections of water vapour (Tinetti et al. [67]; Beaulieu et al. [66]) and methane (Swain et al. [68]) have been achieved, the group has been awarded 20 hours as a Director Discretionary Time on Spitzer (PI Tinetti) to probe the atmosphere of HD 209458b in primary transit in the four IRAC bands. Water vapour was proposed to be present in the atmosphere of HD 209458b by Barman [111], to fit the data recorded by Hubble-STIS in the visible (Knutson et al. [78]). Also, water vapour in emission is a reasonable suggestion to fit the secondary transit photometric data observed in the Mid-IR (Deming et al. [70]; Knutson et al. [78]; Burrows et al. [79]). Our understanding of the thermal profile and composition has improved thanks to more recent secondary transit spectroscopic data in the Near and Mid-IR, indicating the additional presence of methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of HD 209458b (Swain et al. [107]).</figDesc></figure>

The result was it being named in honor of Lyman Spitzer, one of the 20th century's great scientists. Spitzer follows an "earth-trailing" orbit (period 372 days) drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical unit per year. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently entail large usage of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling (such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source) to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the Deep Space Network for communications.</figDesc></figure>

This effect is due to the variations in the quantum efficiency of a pixel, and combined with the undersampling of the PRF, it is most severe in channel 1. The correction can be as much as 4% peak to peak. The effect is graphically shown in Figure 4.8 where the normalized measured flux density (y-axis) is plotted against the distance of the source centroid from the centre of a pixel. The correction for channel 1 can be calculated from:), where (x,y) is the centroid of the point source and x 0 and y 0 are the integer pixel numbers containing the source centroid. The correction was derived from photometry of a sample of stars, each star observed at many positions on the array. The -ratio‖ on the vertical axis in Figure 4.8 is the ratio of the measured flux density to the mean value for the star. To correct the flux of a point source, one should calculate the correction from Equation 4.1 and divide the source flux by that correction.</figDesc></figure>

In contrast, the flux for each exposure is obtained through aperture photometry since this offers substantially larger signal-to-noise compared to the PSF flux estimates. The PSF fitted estimates of X and Y exhibit significant scatter due to photon noise and therefore only the average trends in X and Y represent the true physical motion of the spacecraft, which are ultimately responsible for this effect. It is this spacecraft motion that we wish to correlate to the flux to and not the photon-noise-induced randomisation of X and Y. For example, in channel 1, we find a sinusoidal-like variation in the X-phase with r.m.s. amplitude of 0.023 pixels whereas the uncertainty on each pixel phase determination is 0.026. We find that there is a dominant ~1 hour period sinusoidal-like variation in X and Y, characteristic of small elliptical motion in Spitzer's pointing, with a more complex time trend overlaid. For each channel, we apply a non-linear regression of a sinusoidal wave</figDesc></figure>

In order to account for red noise, we may assume that the impact on d  , T  and c t  are approximately equivalent for additional uncorrelated noise and for correlated noise, so we can simply modify W to absorb the effects of red noise. For uncorrelated noise we add the additional sources of noise in quadrature as done in the technical documents for Kepler (see for example [36]).

THE SEARCH FOR EXOMOONS AND 
THE CHARACTERIZATION OF 
EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES 

di Giammarco Campanella 

Partendo da quando vennero scoperti per la prima volta alcuni pianeti esterni al 

Sistema Solare nel 1992 (attorno ad una pulsar) e nel 1995 (attorno ad una stella di 

Sequenza Principale), gli studi inerenti ai pianeti extrasolari sono divenuti uno dei 

campi di ricerca astronomica più dinamici. Negli anni, la nostra conoscenza dei pianeti 

extrasolari è cresciuta immensamente: si va dalla comprensione dei loro meccanismi di 

formazione ed evoluzione, allo sviluppo di diversi metodi per rivelarli. 

Ora che più di 370 esopianeti sono stati scoperti, l'interesse si è spostato dal trovare i 

pianeti al caratterizzare questi mondi alieni. Oltre ad investigare le atmosfere di questi 

pianeti, parte del processo di caratterizzazione riguarda indubbiamente la ricerca delle 

esolune, i satelliti naturali che orbitano attorno ai pianeti extrasolari. 

La struttura della tesi è la seguente. Nel Capitolo 1 viene fornito un quadro storico 

relativo all'argomento oggetto della tesi e viene presentata la situazione attuale del 

campo di ricerca dei pianeti extrasolari. 

Nel Capitolo 2 vengono descritti alcuni metodi utilizzati per l'individuazione degli 

esopianeti: la velocità radiale, le microlenti gravitazionali, l'astrometria, i dischi 

circumstellari, le variazioni degli intervalli di emissioni di una Pulsar e le emissioni 

magnetosferiche. Inoltre, si illustra con una speciale attenzione la tecnica della 

fotometria di transito e si presentano le due missioni spaziali già operative nell'ambito: 

CoRoT e Kepler. 

Nel Capitolo 3 viene tracciata la situazione attuale della caratterizzazione degli 

esopianeti. Si dedica una particolare attenzione a quei pianeti che transitano davanti alla 

propria stella e che si trovano molto vicino ad essa perché per loro è già possibile 

sondare la caratteristiche spettrali riconducibili proprio all'attività biologica. 

Il Capitolo 4 è incentrato sulla descrizione di un progetto di ricerca inerente 

all'osservazione a 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 e 8.0 μm di alcuni transiti di HD 209458b rilevati 

utilizzando la camera ad infrarossi IRAC del Telescopio Spaziale Spitzer. Vengono 

presentate in dettaglio le procedure adottate per correggere le tendenze sistematiche 

presenti nei dati di IRAC. Le curve di luce sono state quindi fittate, tenendo conto 

dell'oscuramento al bordo, con le tecniche Monte Carlo -Markov Chain‖ e -Prayer-

Bead‖. Si sono ottenute le seguenti misure di profondità di transito: a 3.6 μm, 

1.469±0.013 % e 1.448±0.013 %; a 4.5 μm, 1.478±0.017 %; a 5.8 μm, 1.549±0.015 % 

e a 8.0 μm 1.535±0.011 %. I nostri risultati indicano la presenza di acqua 

nell'atmosfera del pianeta. 

Il Capitolo 5 è dedicato alla ricerca delle esolune, vengono esaminate prima alcune 

tecniche di rivelamento proposte e poi si introduce un modello che descrive le 

variazioni temporali e di durata del transito (TTV/TDV). Questo modello, oltre a 

permettere l'identificazione delle esolune, dà la possibilità di derivare alcune delle sue 

caratteristiche. Si trova che con queste tecniche si potrebbe già rivelare con la 

strumentazione attualmente disponibile una esoluna di massa pari a quella terrestre. viii 

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS/RINGRAZIAMENTI 

Wow, è stato un semestre di preparazione Tesi davvero intenso (sotto tutti i punti di 
vista) in viaggio da Roma all'Inghilterra, alla Puglia, alla Sicilia, alla Scozia e con quanti 
traslochi ed impacchettamenti vari. Il mio ringraziamento deve andare quindi a tutti 
coloro che mi hanno accompagnato durante questo denso periodo. 

La mia prima menzione và naturalmente ai miei familiari: Emilio, Wilma che non mi ha 
visto per 7 mesi, Cristiana, Nonna Maria, gli zii e i cugini... scusate per il tempo che 
non vi ho potuto dedicare e per essermi perso il matrimonio di Mary; in particolare il 
mio ricordo và a Nonna Rosa e ai suoi viaggi in Brasile che forse hanno ispirato il mio 
interesse per l'astronomia. 

Poi un ringraziamento speciale al Mazza e al Direttore Domaschio e a tutti gli amici di 
funny cooperation e i compagni d'interazioni simpatiche... we'll keep in touch in a 
funny way, sempre. 

Inoltre devo ringraziare Mara e Nino per quanto hanno fatto per me a Londra, e poi 
Graziella e Franco in particolare per il pranzo Pasquale in vero stile curdunnese che mi 
ha fatto sentire come a casa.

techniques to obtain very high precision CCD photometry. These techniques include 

differential spatial and temporal photometry, and decorrelation methods to 

compensate for the effects of image motion. Kepler implemented a photometry 

testbed and demonstrated a photometric precision of 10 -5 for CCD photometry in the 

laboratory prior to designing and building flight hardware [32]. Although Kepler somewhat different in other regions of the galaxy, and some very interesting individual 

planets could be discovered by looking toward those regions. 

We are most interested in finding planets relatively nearby to our Solar System 

because the consequent greater observed brightness of the star and planet permit more 

detailed characterization to be achieved, so an all-sky survey, albeit less deep than 

Kepler, is needed. Kepler observes stars in a field just over 100 square degrees in size 

(about 1/400 of the sky). An all-sky survey merely out to magnitude 12 should find at 

least eight times as many planets as Kepler does, and the ones found would, on 

average, be four times closer than the Kepler planets. The recent inference that Super 

Earths are common around solar-type and lower main-sequence stars [33] adds greatly 

to the motivation for an all-sky survey. An all-sky survey would find the closest 

transiting Super Earths or transiting Earth analogs. These results imply that there will 

be a large number of transiting Super Earths orbiting nearby solar-type stars, and the 

closest example is likely to be the planet that can be characterized to the highest 

signal-to-noise ratio [2].

EXPID is an exposure counter incremented within a given AOR for each data-taking command. The DCENUM is a counter of individual frames (per wavelength) from an individual command; it can be used to separate frames generated with internal repeats. DATE OBS is the time at the start of the AOR. Other times in the header include the time since IRAC was turned on (both for the beginning and end of the frame).</figDesc><table>darks or flats go through a similar but separate pipeline. 

Here we describe some of the important header keywords. An almost complete 

IRAC image header description is included in Appendix A. 

EXPTIME is the effective integration time, UTCS OBS is the start of IRAC data 

taking sequence. 

BUNIT gives the units (MJy/sr) of the images. FLUXCONV is the calibration factor 

derived from standard star observations; its units are (MJy/sr)/(DN/s). The raw files 

are in -data numbers‖ (DN). To convert from MJy/sr back to DN, one should divide 

by FLUXCONV and multiply by EXPTIME. To convert DN to electrons, one should 

multiply by GAIN. CRVAL1 and CRVAL2 give the coordinates of the image centre. 

For one of our AOR (AORKEY 24740096), we have 2860 files of each type for each 

channel. The final fits images from this AOR in channel 3 are as follows: 

SPITZER_I3_24740096_0000_0000_1_bcd.fits 
… 
SPITZER_I3_24740096_2859_0000_1_bcd.fits 

After the name of the telescope, the first partition gives the instrument (-I‖ = IRAC), 

and the number after the -I‖ gives the channel (in this case, 3). The next part gives the AORKEY, downloaded from the archive. Finally, there is a group of letters that specify what kind 

of data are in the file (in this case, BCD data) and the file type (here -fits‖).
