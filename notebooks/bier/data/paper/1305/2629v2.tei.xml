			<abstract>
				<p>GJ1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10-18% and 5-15% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H 2 O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although a 100% water composition fits the data for GJ1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and envelope.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The first step towards characterizing a planet is to infer its composition, which can only be done if at least its mass and radius are known. Within the realm of low-mass exoplanets, or super-Earths (M &lt; 10 M E ), there is now a handful of them with measured radii and masses. From internal structure models, the interpretation of the data shows two types of discovered planets: the rocky exoplanets including the high-density ones CoRoT-7b and</p><p>Kepler-10b, with a composition similar to that of Mercury ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Valencia et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wagner et al. 2012</ref>), and Kepler-36b with an Earth-like composition, and the "volatile" planets GJ 1214b, the Kepler-11 system, 55 Cnc-e, <ref type="bibr">Kepler-18b, Kepler-36c, Kepler-68b and Kepler-30b</ref> that are too big to be made of rocks, as well as Kepler-20b which sits at the boundary between necessarily volatile rich and possibly rocky. These last assessments come from comparing their size to the radius of planets made of the lightest rocky composition, one devoid of iron (ie. a planet made of magnesium silicate oxides, MgO+SiO 2 ). In addition, all these planets have effective temperatures that would preclude an icy composition (T eq &gt; 300 K). Thus, it is clear that the volatile planets have gaseous envelopes. What remains to be determined is the nature of this envelope. In particular, it is important to assess if there is hydrogen and helium as this would mean that these planets formed while the protoplanetary nebula was still around.</p><p>Several studies have looked at the problem of inferring the bulk composition of these planets, including their envelopes, through internal structure models. However, the implementation of the opacities so far has been too simple to carry out a consistent and systematic comparison between volatile compositions. These studies have taken into account the effect of composition in density (and entropy) via the equation of state (EOS), but not in the values for the opacities. The main reason for this shortcoming is that available opacity tables exist only at discrete metallicity values. Because the evolution of gaseous planets towards contraction depends on how opaque or transparent the atmosphere is, deconvolving composition and opacity values may cause an over or under estimation -4 -of the final radius of the planet, skewing the interpretation of the data. In view of this problem, we focus on obtaining an analytical fit to the discrete Rosseland opacity tables that would allow us to interpolate to any composition spanning a hydrogen/helium + water/ices composition for the envelope.</p><p>In this study we focus our attention on GJ1214b, and compare its bulk composition to the other volatile planets, because it is the first low-mass planet with a measured spectrum and hence with an estimate of the composition of the upper atmosphere. Due to its size relative to its host star and the fact that the system is close enough to be bright, this planet is amenable to transmission spectroscopy. So far, several groups have obtained data at different wavelengths leading to a rough spectrum of GJ 1214b. Bean On the other hand, internal structure models can help constrain the bulk composition of a planet and thus complement the results from transmission spectroscopy. Two previous studies have investigated the composition of GJ 1214b. <ref type="bibr">Rogers &amp; Seager (2010b)</ref> proposed three different compositions and their respective origin for the envelope of GJ 1214b: a primordial hydrogen and helium envelope acquired while the protosolar nebula was still around, a water envelope acquired in ice form with subsequent evaporation, or a hydrogen envelope which was outgassed from the rocky interior. They used the opacity values by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freedman et al. (2008)</ref>, and a static model (no contraction from the envelope) based on the parameterized grey atmospheric model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Guillot (2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nettelmann et al. (2011)</ref> considered the composition of GJ 1214b to be a mixture of H/He and water, with varying proportions of the two. They have an evolution model that considers cooling and contraction of the envelope, a non-grey atmospheric model and opacities that are 50 times solar. We add to the discussion by using an internal structure model that improves on the implementation of the opacities, and a comprehensive study of the possibilities for the composition of the planet.</p><p>In section 2 we describe the structure model used, and the implementation of the opacities. In section 3 we show the results for GJ 1214b and compare them to the other volatile transiting low-mass planets. Finally we present our summary and conclusions in section 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Structure and Equation of State</head><p>We treat planets as differentiated objects with an Earth-like nucleus below an envelope composed of hydrogen and helium (H/He) as well as water (H 2 O). We use the combined internal structure model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Valencia et al. (2006)</ref> for the Earth-like nucleus (with composition 33% by mass iron core + 67% magnesium silicate mantle with 10% iron by mol -[(Mg 0.9 , Fe 0.1 )SiO 3 +(Mg 0.9 , Fe 0.1 )O]) and CEPAM numerical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guillot &amp; Morel 1995)</ref> for the gaseous envelope. The two are tied at the solid surface by ensuring continuity in mass and pressure. At this point we have not imposed continuity in the temperature justified in part by the small effect of temperature in the density of rocks.</p><p>The EOS used is the Vinet EOS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Vinet et al. 1989</ref>) for the rocky interior by combining the EOS of the end members with the additive density rule to obtain an EOS of the mixture that is then used in the integration of the structure equations. For the envelope we use the EOS of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Saumon et al. (1995)</ref> for hydrogen and helium, considering always a fixed proportion of Y=0.27 by mass of helium to the total amount of H 2 + He. For the water, we combine the EOS of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">French et al. (2009)</ref> that is relevant for temperatures above 1000 K with the NIST EOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Saul &amp; Wagner 1989)</ref> which is well suited for low temperatures, to span the temperature range between the critical point of water and 10,000 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Opacities</head><p>Owing to the fact that we are interested in constraining the composition of the envelope by spanning all possible combinations between the end members H/He and H 2 O, we need corresponding opacities. Unfortunately, the data available for opacities is limited to a few discrete compositions. It is also limited in its maximal pressure, implying that interior models must rely (often implicitly) on extrapolations. We use the data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freedman et al. (2008)</ref> updated to include revised collisional induced absorption by H 2 molecules for a solar composition, 2 and 1/2 times solar composition, plus an additional two data sets at 30 and 50 times solar (hereafter F08). We obtain an analytical fit to the Rosseland opacities by using a non-linear least squares minimization approach useful within the temperature and pressure ranges relevant for planetary interiors. The data sets span temperatures between 75 and 4,000 K, and pressures between 10 −6 to 300 bars, and the fit extrapolates smoothly in pressure, temperature (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1)</ref> and metallicity.</p><p>The analytical fit has the form for the opacity κ gas (in g cm −2 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">κ gas = κ lowP + κ highP (1)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">log 10 κ lowP = c 1 (log 10 T − c 2 log 10 P − c 3 ) 2 + (c 4 met + c 5 )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>log 10 κ highP = c 6 + c 7 log 10 T + c 8 log 10 T 2 + log 10 P (c 9 + c 10 log 10 T )</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ met c 11 1 2 + 1 π arctan log 10 T − 2.5 0.2<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where T is temperature in kelvins, P is pressure in dyn cm −2 , and met is the metallicity with respect to solar in logarithmic scale (i.e. met = [M/H]). This fit effectively transitions smoothly between two different functions that are relevant at low (κ lowP ) and high pressures (κ highP ) respectively. The values for the coefficients are shown in table 1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows a comparison between the data from F08 for a solar composition and a metallicity 30 times higher ([M/H]=1.5) and the results from our proposed analytical fit.</p><p>The calculations by F08 consider a grain-free atmosphere with a composition that evolves depending on the condensates that form and get removed from the gaseous phase.</p><p>We are interested in assessing whether or not grains have an impact on the inference in envelope composition. We focus on the end-member case of grains not settling into clouds, but remaining mixed within the background gas. To model this type of grains we turn to the calculations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alexander &amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref> (hereafter AF94) to come up with a simple prescription that includes the opacity contribution from mixed grains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alexander &amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref> examined opacities at warm to high temperatures (between 700-12,500 K),</p><p>and low density values captured in log 10 ¯ R = −7 to +1 where ¯ R = ρ/T 3 6 , ρ is the density in g cm −3 and T 6 is the temperature expressed in millions of degrees (corresponding densities are 10 −15 to 10 −8 g cm −3 at 1,000 K and 10 −13 − 10 −5 g cm −3 at 10,000 K) most relevant to the conditions of the protoplanetary nebula. In contrast, planetary interiors have larger density/pressure so that typical values are +6 &lt; log 10 ¯ R &lt; +7 . Their results show that grains are only present below a certain temperature, which depends on the value of ¯ R.</p><p>Despite the fact that AF94's data is calculated at very low values of ¯ R, there is a clear trend on the effect of grains that we extrapolate to larger values of ¯ R (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alexander &amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref>). We fit a simple linear trend within the regions where grains are present and add this to the gas opacity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">κ =              κ gas + κ grains if T &lt; T * 1</formula><p>, and log 10 κ grains = 0.430 + 1.3143 (log 10 T − 2.85)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">κ gas if T &gt; T * 2<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where log 10 T * 1 = 0.0245 log ¯ R + 1.971 and log 10 T * 2 = 0.0245 log ¯ R + 3.221. The region  between these two critical points is just a linear interpolation between κ gas (T * 1 ) + κ grains (T * 1 ) and κ gas (T * 2 ).</p><p>We show the comparison between the two data sets (from AF94 and F08) and our fit to the data with a prescription for grains at low temperatures (dashed lines) and without grains (dotted lines) on <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. On the left, we compare the data (thin lines for AF94, thick lines for F08) and our fit (dashed) for low densities (log 10 ¯ R = −1 (black) and log 10 ¯ R = +1</p><p>(blue)) and a solar composition. According to AF94, the majority of the opacities for temperatures lower than T * 2 (or ∼1,800 K for log 10 ¯ R = +1 ) are due to grains, which we account for. The second feature of AF94 is a modest increase (a 'bump') in the opacities due to the presence of water vapor at temperatures right above T * 2 (between 1,800 K and 3,000 K for log 10 ¯ R = −1 ), which becomes less prominent with increasing value of ¯ R <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">&amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref>. We note that this feature is missing in our fit to the data by F08 yielding differences in the opacities of almost an order of magnitude around the 10 −2 cm 2 /g level within this high temperature and low pressure ( e.g. low ¯ R) range. However, this mismatch we think may be less of an issue at pressure-temperature values pertinent to planetary interiors given that the trend is for this feature to be less prominent with increasing ¯ R values, and that the opacities relevant for planetary atmospheres are in the 1-10 6 magnitude range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alexander</head><p>We compare the effect of envelope composition by showing in <ref type="figure">Fig 2 (right)</ref> the opacities for a solar ( Z ices =0.01, where Z ices is the ratio of water/ices to envelope mass, pink), a 50% H/He + 50% H 2 O/ices mixture (Z ices =0.5, purple) and a 100% H 2 O/ices envelope (Z ices =1, blue) at a constant, more relevant value of log 10 ¯ R = +6.5. It can be seen that the opacities increase smoothly and monotonically without grains (solid lines). In the presence of grains there is a considerable (almost step-like) increase in opacities for temperatures below ∼2,000K that depends on how much water there is, from more than one order of magnitude for solar composition to just a few tens of dex for envelopes rich in water/ices.</p><p>The small effect of grains on water-rich atmospheres is due to the fact that the opacities are -10 -already quite high for such compositions.</p><p>We find that very quickly the opacities become high as soon as the envelopes have non-negligible amounts of water/ices so that the difference between opacities for a 50x solar envelope (or Z ices =0.25) and a pure water/ices is only of the order of ∼50 g cm −2 over a range that covers several orders of magnitude (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>Extrapolation The pressure-temperature regime of super-Earths is between millibars to a few megabars, and between a few hundred to ∼10,000 degrees kelvin. The opacity database from which the fit is derived covers this regime partially, and extrapolation is needed beyond 300 bars and 4,000 K ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). In fact, no current database covers the planetary regime fully. Therefore internal structure studies of planets use some sort of extrapolation. We used the work by AF94 to serve as a guide for the extrapolation to high temperatures, and note that the opacities become increasingly more uncertain as the pressures and temperatures increase much beyond the database of AF08. This may not be too much of a problem as the high PT regime corresponds to the deep interior of the planet (which is fully convective), and most of the cooling is controlled by the radiative upper part of the envelope/atmosphere (P &lt; kbar, T&lt; 2,000K) where the opacities are either not too far from or within the database range. However it is important to keep in mind the limitations of the extrapolation.</p><p>In general, the construction of high temperature databases requires that transitions that originate in energy levels above the ground state be included in the calculations.</p><p>If this is not done, then there will be missing opacity that will increase in magnitude as the temperature increases. In the case of the opacity tables provided for this study, wherever possible opacity data using "hot" line lists has been used. These lists include line transitions from levels that are not populated at room temperature so that the opacity is more accurately represented at higher temperatures but these lists still may not include all the opacity at the highest temperatures. It is difficult to include in a quantum mechanical -11 - <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-Comparison Opacities. Left) For a solar composition opacities according to <ref type="bibr">Alexan- der &amp; Ferguson (1994)</ref> are shown in thin solid lines, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freedman et al. (2008)</ref> in thick solid lines, our fit with grains in dashed lines and without grains in dotted lines at log 10 ¯ R = −1 in black and log 10 ¯ R = +1 and blue. Right) Comparison for three different envelope compositions: solar, Z ices =0.01, (pink); 50% ices + 50% H/He , Z ices =0.5 (purple);</p><p>and pure ices, Z ices =1, (blue) for log 10 ¯ R = +6.5 (relevant to planetary interiors) and grainy (solid) and grain-free (dotted) cases. Our fit is an extrapolation of the data beyond 4000 K, -12 -model all the levels that may contribute opacity at the highest temperatures.</p><p>By considering the species individually and assessing how they contribute to the total opacity, it is reasonable to assume that the opacity will continue to increase with T but only up to the point where the population of the upper states reaches a limit where the effects of additional increases in T are slight (due to the exponential dependence of the Boltzmann factor). Since for most polyatomics the first excited electronic state is far above the ground state, it is only the vibrational/rotational levels in the ground electronic state that need to be considered. This is especially true in the case of a main source of opacity, water, where the first bound, excited state is ∼7.5 ev above the ground state. On the other hand, an important source of absorption at high T is the presence of free electrons and the associated free-free and bound-free opacities, which may have a more significant effect than the filling of the band gaps, counteracting the saturation effect previously discussed.</p><p>In addition, the effect of very high pressure may also have a leveling-off component.</p><p>For moderate pressures the line width will increase with pressure but eventually a limit is reached when the density approaches a value where the gas starts to behave more like a liquid and the line width no longer increases linearly with pressure. Unfortunately, the actual line width at these high pressures is not at all well-known and the simple theories for line shape are no longer valid, making extrapolation rather uncertain.</p><p>To test how sensitive the extrapolation is to high temperatures we use a synthetic opacity fit with a much lower dependence on temperature (parameter c 8 = 5). We consider two planets with a mass of 0.020 M Jup , T eq = 500 K and a core mass fraction of 50%:</p><p>one with a 100% water/ices envelope and one with a mixture of 90% H/He and 10%</p><p>water/ices. We find that the radiative-convective boundary moves shallower by 10% and 20% in pressure at 10 Gyr, respectively, and that the opacity values increase by 12% and 17% respectively. Not enough to change the PT structure or total radius significantly (by 0.2% and 5% respectively at 2.5 Gyr and by less than 1 part in 1000 for both cases at pressures and temperatures that include the radiative-convective transition, which for these warm sub-Neptunes is &lt; 5 kbar and &lt; 2000 K.</p><p>In addition, the database used (AF08) only spans a limited range of envelope compositions: solar, -1/2x solar, 1/2x solar, 30x solar and 50x solar in gaseous form (no solids). Thus, extrapolation is needed to cover the whole space from solar to water-rich envelopes. From this set we observe that the dominant dependence of the logarithm of the opacity with metallicity is a linear dependence beyond some estimated temperature (∼ 3000K). This simple fit (see Eq. 3) captures the intuitive behavior that opacity increases with the number of molecules present, while fitting the database well. It is of course, too simple of an extrapolation to capture the details. We await actual data at larger metallicity values to compare to our fit, especially as more sub-Neptune planets are found.</p><p>We hope that in the future there will be no need for extrapolation, and encourage the expansion of opacity databases to higher PT and water rich compositions important for modeling the structure of low-mass exoplanets, in the meantime our proposed fit may serve as a starting point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Metallicity and composition</head><p>To use the opacity fit, we relate the composition of the envelope to metallicity. We consider the envelope to be composed of H 2 -He and 'ices', where the ices are composed of water, ammonia and methane (H 2 O + NH 3 + CH 4 ), in the same proportions as in the solar nebula. We implicitly assume that there are no rock forming minerals that could bind to oxygen, so that the amount of water in the envelope is reflected in the amount of oxygen atoms (N O ), and that the other ices are fixed by the solar ratios of carbon and nitrogen to oxygen.</p><p>This means that Z ices , the amount of 'ices' by mass is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Z ices = N O µ H 2 O + N C µ CH 4 + N N µ NH 3 N H µ H + N He µ He + N O µ O + N C µ C + N N µ N ,</formula><p>where N i and µ i are the number of atoms and the molecular weight of species i, respectively. We take constant the proportion of He to the total amount of mass in the non-metallic portion (H 2 +He) and equal to c = 0.27 (i.e. using the conventional notation:</p><p>Y/(X+Y)=0.27 ). Therefore, the metallicity can be expressed as <ref type="bibr">Lodders (2003)</ref>.

For high values of γ, the energy is deposited in the upper layers of the atmosphere and can be lost toward space very easily. For values of γ lower than unity, the energy is deposited in deeper layers, where the atmosphere is optically thick in the infrared. There, the energy cannot escape the planet, and contributes to its global energy, slowing its contraction. Theoretically, γ could be calculated from the opacity tables. However, we note that the temperature of the isothermal zone around the 1 bar level is very sensitive to its value. Thus we use the value of γ that better reproduces the more sophisticated radiative transfer models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Miller-Ricci &amp; Fortney (2010)</ref>. We choose γ = 0.032, which gives a temperature of 1,000 K around 1bar</p><p>for GJ1214b, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">figure 3</ref>. Miller- <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ricci &amp; Fortney (2010)</ref> show that, in the case of GJ1214b, the temperature around 1 bar does not depend strongly on the composition of the planet. Thus, we use the same γ for the different compositions considered. For GJ 1214b, we find that the interior temperature is 62K at 0.1 Gyr, 40K at 1 Gyr, 35K at 2.5</p><p>Gyr and 24K at 10 Gyr for a solar atmosphere, and 80K at 0.1 Gyr, 50K at 1Gyr, 42K at 2.5 Gyr and 35K at 10 Gyr for a water-rich envelope.</p><p>Note that γ will change with orbital distance. It is expected to be higher for planets the Planck function very much. However, for hotter planets, not considered in this study, the value of gamma could change significantly.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">GJ 1214b</head><p>We obtain the structure and total radius for planets with a mass of 5. and proportion of water to total envelope mass (wf), in the form R = R(M, nf, wf), and -16 - spline interpolate in the three dimensions (mass, nf, wt). Since we are interested in inferring the composition of a planet from its transit radius, we consider the radius of the planet to be the height at which the path traveled by the starlight would be equal to an optical depth of unity. We examined three cases: (1) a grain-free envelope and (2) a grainy envelope at an equilibrium temperature of T eq = 500 K and c) a grain-free envelope at T eq = 600 K. where χ env is the envelope's composition, T 10 and P 10 are the temperature and pressure at 10 bars), the planets cool and contract according to how much energy is being transported out (bottom left panel). The solid and dashed lines correspond to equilibrium temperatures of 500 and 600 K. As it can be seen, this small difference in equilibrium temperature has little effect on the interior structure or evolution of the planets.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the envelopes that have lower molecular weight yield the largest radii, while at the same time suffer the most contraction. We find this trend to be true for most planets except for the ones that have less than 10% content of water in the envelope. That is to say, that we find that planets that have envelopes of 100% H/He are slightly smaller than those that have 90% H/He+10% water/ices envelopes. We attribute this to a competing effect between larger envelope density that would make planets smaller for a given mass, and higher opacities that slow down the cooling. At larger fractions of water content in the atmosphere, the density effect dominates. Interestingly, this effect gives rise to a new kind of degeneracy. For the same value of envelope mass, two different combinations of H/He + water/ices with two different evolutionary tracks, yield the same radius at some given age (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig 5)</ref>. This illustrates the importance of using evolutionary models, as static ones could miss these possibilities. By implementing the physics behind contraction and evolution, the internal structure model is able to resolve time-dependent possibilities. This envelope that makes up 3% of the total mass, two different envelope compositions yield the same radius of 6.55 R E at 3 Gyr. An envelope that is mostly H/He (99.9% H/He and only 0.1% water in the envelope) that starts very expanded and contracts rapidly initially, and an envelope that is made of 3/4 of H/He and 1/4 of water, that contracts initially more slowly. To resolve this kind of degeneracy one would need a radius measurement at two different ages, which is impossible to obtain. Therefore, we find that for low-mass planets with a non-negligible envelope or sub-Neptunes, there is an intrinsic and persistent degeneracy that stems from the contraction history of the planet.</p><p>Heat is normally transferred out of the planet's envelope by convection in the interior where the adiabatic gradient is lower than the radiative one, and by radiation in the upper layers where the opacity is lower and the converse is true. We find that this radiative-convective boundary happens at deeper levels, larger temperatures, and lower local entropies, as the amount of water+ices in the envelope decreases (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). The variation in opacity and pressure of this boundary is at least an order of magnitude and decreases with increasing water+ice content (from 4600 bars for a solar composition to 138 bars for a water/ice envelope). In addition, with increasing age this boundary happens at a similar local entropy which means it moves deeper (higher pressures) as the planet cools in time. Below the boundary, the envelope is fully adiabatic and the values for opacities are less important, as long as they do not preclude the envelope from being convective.</p><p>This means that the extrapolation of the opacities is most important up to several kilobars (∼5000 bars) and a few thousand kelvins (∼2000K) for these warm sub-Neptune planets.</p><p>The effect of grain opacity is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> where we present the results for the transit radius corresponding to two different envelope compositions: a) 100% H 2 O, b) 50% H 2 O+ 50% H/He, while also changing the proportion of envelope to Earth-like nucleus.</p><p>The effect of grains (dashed-dotted lines) is most noticeable for low molecular weight atmospheres, and is negligible for water-dominated envelopes. This is because for water dominated atmospheres the gas opacities are already high (∼10 g/cm 2 ) and comparable to the grain opacities (within a factor of ∼0.5 dex), while for H/He dominated atmospheres the gas opacity is 0.1-1 g/cm 2 , one order of magnitude smaller than with grains (compare solid and dotted pink lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the mass and radius data for GJ 1214b are consistent with a pure H 2 O/ices composition (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7-left)</ref>, regardless of the uncertainty in age, as contraction is negligible for water dominated atmospheres. However, this composition is unlikely to exist. The condensation temperature of water and ices is much lower than that of rocks, so that during condensation some refractory material should have condensed out of the solar nebula before the bulk of the water and ices did, entailing the existence of some amount of rocky material in this planet. This in turn, implies the presence of a material lighter than water as well, so as to offset the high-density character of the refractory material and fit the radius of the planet. The most obvious component is H/He because of Earth-like composition (green), a Mercury-like -enriched in iron with respect to Earth with an iron to silicate ratio 6 times that of Earth -(brown), and one voided of iron completely (pure magnesium-silicate oxides) (orange). The latter shows the limit above which a planet has to have volatiles and cannot be completely rocky.</p><p>its abundance in astrophysical objects, although another possibility is outgassed hydrogen <ref type="bibr">(Rogers &amp; Seager 2010b</ref>).</p><p>The effect of temperature is very small for super-Earths but modest for sub-Earths (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). It is in fact, comparable to the effect of grains, which is more important for low molecular-weight envelopes. Relevant to GJ 1214b we can quantify the effect of equilibrium temperature by noting that a 100 K increase in equilibrium temperature (that translates to an increase of ∼200 K at 10 bars) increases the radius of the planet by only ∼2%. The temperature effect is small as long as the species in the envelope do not change phase with different equilibrium temperatures.</p><p>More systematically, we ran the internal structure model to span all possible compositions for the envelope between the two extremes of solar (Z ices =0.01) to 100%</p><p>H 2 O/ices (Z ices =1), and varying amounts of rocky to envelope ratios. We show the results at a nominal age of 4.6 Gy for GJ 1214b and at 8 Gyr for Kepler-11e in the ternary diagrams that relate Earth-like nucleus, water/ices and H/He by mass (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>). Each ternary diagram corresponds to a specific planetary mass, and every point in the ternary diagram depicts one unique composition. These ternary diagrams are equivalent to the (x,y,z) plane where x+y+z=1, and x,y,z &gt; 0. The values for the transit radius are shown in color in terms of earth radii and the lines of constant radii are labeled. There are a few important aspects to note from the results contained in these ternary diagrams:</p><p>• • The radius is most sensitive to the amount of H/He and much less to the amount of H 2 O/ices and rocky nucleus. This is seen from how parallel the lines of constant radius are to increasing amounts of H/He content. This means that with a radius measurement and just some knowledge that the planetary mass ranges between 5-10 M ⊕ , it is possible to estimate the H/He content of the planet. Conversely, even with perfect data for mass and radius, it is not be possible to estimate the amount of water/ices or refractory material, as they trade-off quite efficiently.</p><p>• The effect of the presence of grains is non-linear and is most noticeable for planets with large contents of H/He.</p><p>The possible compositions for GJ 1214b that take into account the uncertainty in mass and radius are shown with a black band in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. It is clear that this planet has less than 10% by mass of H/He, but that it can have a wide range of compositions because of the trade-off between water/ices and rocky nucleus. Another way to show the results is depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, where the trade-off between bulk H/He and rocky nucleus (middle <ref type="figure">figure)</ref> or bulk H/He and H 2 O/ices (bottom <ref type="figure">figure)</ref> is shown. This can be translated to the content of H/He and H 2 O/ices in the atmosphere (top of <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). As the amount of solid core increases, the percentage of H/He in the envelope increases while that of water decreases. This translates to a bulk H/He content that increases as the solid core increases up to a point where it decreases again. The maximum amount of bulk H/He the planet may have happens in conjunction with some water in the envelope.</p><p>We show the range in compositions of the envelope admitted by the data at the two limiting ages of 3 Gyr (dash-dotted lines) and 10 Gyr (solid lines) to examine the effect of age. In general, an older planet would admit more H/He than a younger planet for a given radius. For GJ 1214b, the fact that the age is not well constrained does not constitute a problem when inferring the composition of its envelope, as the effect is small. For planets older than ∼1 Gyr with water-dominated envelopes, age has an effect of less than 1% in the inference of envelope composition. We conclude that while the total amount of H/He in GJ 1214b can be robustly constrained to be less than 7% by mass, the data admits almost all possible compositions for the envelope at any given age. In the scenario of a solar metallicity envelope (H/He + z=0.01), we find the data constraints its content to be ∼ 3%</p><p>by mass.</p><p>According to their transmission spectra, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bean et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bean et al. ( , 2011</ref>) suggest an atmosphere of more than 70% water. If we assume that the upper atmosphere has the same composition as the envelope below, this range would slightly narrow the composition of the planet to have a rocky component of less than 90% by mass (see top panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). In summary, because of the large trade-offs between refractory material and water/ices, even with spectroscopic measurements and the assumption that the atmosphere is well-mixed, it is not possible to sufficiently narrow the refractory or water/ices composition of the planet. (for obvious reasons), we find a different value for the minimum amount of water if there is no H/He. Our calculations show a minimum value of 65% (see bottom <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the opacity treatment from <ref type="bibr">Rogers &amp; Seager (2010b)</ref>, which uses the Planck means from molecular line data from F08, does not extend to very water rich atmospheres. On the other hand, Nettelmann et al. (2011) considered a similar structure to ours with a homogeneous gas envelope. A minor difference that should not influence the results is that they model a homogeneous rocky interior, while we consider a layered Earth-like one below the envelope. In their models of H/He envelope above a rocky core they claim a range of 1.3-3.4% of H/He. They suggest that the upper limit of H/He can rise up to 5-6% if the envelope contains 60-90% water in mass. In comparison,</p><p>we obtain a value of 3% of H/He envelope at 3 Gy, and also obtain a maximum amount of H/He by adding 80-90% by mass of water to the envelope (corresponding to 25% of water by total planetary mass). We suggest that this small difference may come from different opacity values as well.</p><p>In addition, we find that our results are robust to reasonable variations of thermal inertia of the planet including different radioactive heat production or heat capacity of the Earth-like nucleus. The lower boundary heat flux entering the envelope is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">˙ L sol = ˙ rad + C v dT /dt,</formula><p>where ˙ rad is the radioactive heat production, and C v is the heat capacity. We used a chondritic value for the heat generation (2 × 10 20 J/s/g) which is a factor of ∼ 2 lower than Earth's bulk silicate value, and a heat capacity of 7 × 10 7 J/K/g which is appropriate for the Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stacey 1981)</ref>. By increasing ˙ rad by a factor of 5 we find a discrepancy at 3 Gyr of ∼2%, and by increasing Cv by a factor of 10 we find a discrepancy of ∼6% for a planet with a H/He envelope that makes 3% and 20% of the planet. Being that H/He envelopes are the ones more susceptible to changes in temperature, we conclude that the radius of a sub-Neptune planet is not very sensitive to the thermal evolution of its rocky nucleus. This stands in contrast to the findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nettelmann et al. (2011)</ref> and ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Mass Loss</head><p>It is well recognized that atmospheric escape may play an important role in highly irradiated exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Valencia et al. 2010)</ref>, and GJ 1214b is no exception. Although a detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper, we can estimate the order of magnitude effect of atmospheric escape on GJ 1214b. Starting from the commonly-used energy limited escape formulation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Watson et al. 1981)</ref>, the mass lost per unit time of a planet of mass M is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˙ M = ππR 2 XUV R F XUV /GM K tide ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where R XUV is the radius at which the bulk of the X-ray and extreme UV (XUV) flux is absorbed, R is the radius below which molecules are bound to the planet, F XUV is the XUV flux at the planet's location, G is the gravitational constant, K tide is a correction factor that takes into account that the molecules only need to reach the Roche lobe before they escape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Erkaev et al. 2007)</ref>, and is the heating efficiency defined as the ratio of the net heating rate to the rate of stellar energy absorption. One conservative, simple and commonly used approach is to assume R XUV ∼ R. In reality the height at which the planet absorbs X-rays and the extreme UV are different and also larger than the planetary radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lammer et al. 2003</ref>). By adopting the assumption, we can simplify Eq. 5 to ˙ M = 3F XUV /4GρK tide where ρ is the density of the planet, which increases with time as the planet loses mass. Mass loss progresses from fast early on, to slow as time increases, due to two facts: (1) the lighter outer regions get stripped away leaving a denser planet from which molecules have a harder time escaping, and (2) the XUV flux from the star decreases with time.</p><p>The most unconstrained parameter, and where most of the physics is hidden in the mass loss equation is the heating efficiency, although common values range between 0.1-0.4.</p><p>Finally, it is important to know how the XUV flux of the star has varied overtime, and while GJ 1214 is considered to be a quiet star presently ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charbonneau et al. 2009</ref>), being a low-mass M star, it most likely had an active period early on. We implement the model of XUV flux proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ribas (2009)</ref>. The XUV luminosity starts in a saturated phase after which it drops off as a power law function of age. The saturation phase duration (t * ) depends on the type of star, as seen by its bolometric luminosity. If we focus on a conservative estimate we can further simplify the mass loss equation by assuming that the planet loses mass at the present density held constant. This is obviously an idealization and a lower bound for estimating the amount of mass lost, since at a young age planets are lighter and less capable of binding their upper atmospheres. We also set K tide = 1. The expression for the XUV flux (?) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">F XUV =        4.04 × 10 −24 L 0.79 bol a −2 (erg /s/cm −2 ) if t 9 &lt; t * 9</formula><p>, and 29.7 t −1.72</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">9 a −2 (erg /s/cm −2 ) if t 9 &gt; t * 9 (6)</formula><p>where <ref type="bibr">et al. 2009</ref>), and obtain a saturation phase duration of 2 Gyr for GJ 1214b. We calculate a mass loss between 100 Myr and 3 Gyr of 0.6 M E and 2.5 M E for a heating efficiency of 0.1 and 0.4, respectively.

This is most important when trying to assess the origin of the planet and the stability of an envelope. Charbonneau et al. it is unclear how stable or vulnerable a thin envelope may be. On the other hand, our simple calculation more robustly suggests that the compositional cases where GJ 1214b has a modest envelope, seem to be stable. Therefore, while atmospheric escape might have been significant in the past it appears to be moderate at present for GJ 1214b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Comparison to Kepler-11</head><p>A good starting point to compare low-mass planets is GJ 1214b, because it is the coolest volatile planet and lies right at the threshold of a pure water mass-radius relationship.</p><p>This means that any of the volatile planets over 1 Gyr old with a radius comparable to or larger than GJ 1214b necessarily has H/He. Even though the planets shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> have different ages, they are all older than 1 Gyr, with CoRoT-7b being the youngest (1.2-2.3</p><p>Gyr ( <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2009)</ref>), so that the MR relationships apply. In fact, most of the transiting planets with known mass are older than the solar system, so the inferred amount of H-He from a younger age (of 4.6 Gyr) would be a minimum.</p><p>From <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> we infer that Kepler-11f also has some H/He in its envelope, despite its very low mass of 2.0 +0.8 −0.9 M ⊕ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. 2013</ref>) as its radius stands above the pure-water relationship adequate for its equilibrium temperature. In fact, because of the behavior of the mass-radius relationships for volatile compositions that flare out towards low masses, both planets Kepler-11f and GJ 1214b could have the same composition. This flaring effect is due to the fact that low-mass planets have low gravities that do not bind efficiently their volatile envelopes.</p><p>Furthermore, we focus on Kepler-11e as this planet is as cool as GJ 1214b but its radius is 1.6 times larger. We obtain all possible compositions for Kepler-11e (top left <ref type="figure">Fig.   8</ref>) with the new reported data in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lissauer et al. (2013)</ref> and find that the minimum amount of bulk H/He is 10% and the maximum is 18% by mass (an improvement from the old reported radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>) that yielded 10-25% content) . Being that this planet is the largest and coolest of the transiting super-Earths, it means that all other detected volatile planets have less than 20% bulk H/He. In fact, we find that all volatile super-Earths discovered so far have less than 10% H/He by mass, comparable to Uranus and Neptune <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hubbard &amp; MacFarlane 1980)</ref>, except for Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b. We find the latter to have between 5-15% H/He. This also brings into light that the solar system trend of decreasing H/He with heliocentric distance for the gaseous planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hubbard &amp; MacFarlane 1980)</ref> does not apply to the Kepler-11 system.</p><p>A study by ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lopez et al. 2012</ref>) investigated the possible compositions for each planet of the Kepler-11 system with an evolutionary model and connected it to atmospheric escape histories. For the structure part, they considered the envelope to be made of an outer layer of H/He above an interior water layer. They use a non-grey model for their atmosphere and opacities at 50 times solar for all their models. For water-less worlds they report that present day (at 8 Gyr) inventories of H/He are 17.2% for Kepler-11e, and less than ∼8% for all others planets. This stands in excellent agreement with our results considering that the amount of H/He would increase somewhat once they take into account the one-sigma uncertainty in masses and radii.</p><p>Placing constraints on the amount of H/He helps validate formation models. According to our model, GJ 1214b must have formed rather early, when there was still enough H/He in the solar nebula. In addition, multi-planet systems pose an additional constrain, which is to explain either the trend or lack thereof of H/He content with heliocentric distance. The latter is the case of Kepler-11, with planet e having to have at least 10% of H/He and up to 18% at 42 R Sun , and neighboring planets d at 34 R Sun and low-mass planet f at 44 R Sun with at most 10% H/He. A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ikoma &amp; Hori 2012)</ref> investigates the formation of single low-mass planets with H/He envelopes by invoking in-situ accretion that they then apply to Kepler-11. While they do not consider H/He+H 2 O mixtures for envelope which would have an effect on the rate of cooling and accretion due to higher opacities, they explain the H/He content of most of the planets in the system. It remains to be shown how accretion of low-mass multiple planets can acquire envelopes that also have water/ices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>To assess the bulk composition of low-mass, low-density exoplanets and specifically GJ1214b, we ran a comprehensive suite of internal structure and evolutionary models with a proposed prescription for opacity values that span from solar to about 450 times solarcorresponding to a composition of 100% H 2 O/ices.</p><p>Given that the opacities tables that are commonly used by internal structure models are only known at discrete metallicity values that do not cover all the possible envelope compositions that the sub-Neptune planets may have, we focused our efforts in fitting these opacity tables to an analytical function that describes the global behavior of opacities in the pressure-temperature (P-T) and metallicity regime (from water/ices) in which they are derived, as well as extrapolate smoothly into higher P-T and water content space. The most important regime for opacities for warm sub-Neptune planets (with an equilibrium temperature ∼500 K) are up to ∼5 kbars and ∼2000 K, which covers the radiative-convective boundary in the envelope. Opacities at larger pressures (with corresponding larger temperatures) fall within the fully convective interior.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that the differences in opacity values of a pure water/ices envelope and a 50 x solar envelope, which is one of the most metal rich opacity tables available, and corresponds to 1/3 water/ices + 2/3 H/He are not too large, in the order of a few dex. This means that while using it for envelopes with much larger water contents is not consistent, it probably does not introduce a big source of error in the results.</p><p>We find that there is another type of degeneracy pertinent to sub-Neptune planets that arises from the evolutionary history of the planet. Two different envelope compositions of the same mass around the same rocky nucleus may yield the same radius at a given age while differing in the rest of their evolutionary tracks. This degeneracy is different in character to the one that arises from the trade-offs between the different compositional end-members.</p><p>We obtain the bulk composition of GJ 1214b and find that no more than 7% of H/He is needed to explain the radius of this planet given its mass. In addition, based on formation arguments we expect to have some H/He present in the envelope. This is due to the fact that some refractory material is expected to compose this planet (from the condensation sequence). Our result is consistent with two previous studies focused on GJ 1214b, which use different treatments for the opacities.</p><p>More generally, we find that the radius of low-density planets with a mass between 5-10 M ⊕ is most sensitive to the amount of H/He, and much less on the amount of water and rocks. On the upside, this means that it is possible to place good constraints on the amount of H/He in these planets, which can be used to further constraint formation models. On the down side, it means that little can be said about the amount of water or rocks in these planets because these two compositional end-members trade-off very efficiently.</p><p>For GJ 1214b and similar planets the implication is that the inference of a water rich upper atmosphere from transmission spectroscopy studies does not help constrain the bulk composition of the envelope and planet, whereas an H/He dominated atmosphere would restrict the bulk composition much more, only if we assume a homogeneous composition between the upper atmosphere and deeper envelope. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>et al.</head><label></label><figDesc>(2010, 2011); Désert et al.

In their four-layer model they find a range of 10 −4 − 0.068 for H/He is admitted by the data at the one-sigma level, in their three layer model with vapor they find a range of 47-100%, and with outgassed H 2 a small value of only 5x10 −4 .

According to our simple calculation, the current flux at the planet's semi-major axis is 39 W/m 2 , and the present mass loss rate is 2.4 × 10 8 kg/s or ∼ 1.25 Earth-masses per billion years. If the heating efficiency is close to 1, then a modest envelope ( 0.2 M p ) may be stable for a billion year timescale.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_10"><head>Furthermore</head><label></label><figDesc>, we find that almost all discovered low-mass planets -Kepler 11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-68b, Kepler-36c -have a maximum H/He component of less than 10% by mass. While it could be that some of them have no H/He whatsoever, it seems that, despite having much hotter equilibrium temperatures, the low-density low-mass exoplanets share a similar trait to Neptune and Uranus of having a few percent of H/He. The exceptions are Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b with a range of 10-18% and 5-15% of bulk H/He respectively. Being that there's is a bias towards detecting larger planets, the fact that the majority of the low-mass planets have less than 10% H/He indicates that larger contents are probably not common. The tightly packed Kepler-11 system seems to have a range of H/He that does not vary monotonically with -36 - heliocentric distance, with planet d and f having less H/He than planet e, which may point to more local/planet-specific conditions determining the compositional outcome. In other words, it remains to be explained why Kepler-11e acquired 10-18% by mass of H/He while simultaneously its inner and outer neighbors acquired less. Multiplanet sub-Neptune systems with known H/He contents may prove to be key in understanding planet formation. Inferring the bulk composition of low-mass planets helps us clarify the differences in nature between the solid super-Earths and the sub-Neptune planets that share the same mass range, and also provide useful constraints to formation and migration scenarios for this new class of planets.

Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-68b, Kepler-36c and Kepler-30b have a 

radius no larger than five times that of the Earth. This suggests (see isoradius lines 

in Fig. 8) that the H/He content is limited to less than ∼20% by mass for hot 

sub-Neptunes (less than 10M E ). In fact, if we remove Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b
