				<p>This paper presents a new theory of the dynamical tides of celestial bodies. It is founded on a Newtonian creep instead of the classical delaying approach of the standard viscoelastic theories and the results of the theory derive mainly from the solution of a non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Lags appear in the solution but as quantities determined from the solution of the equation and are not arbitrary external quantities plugged in an elastic model. The resulting lags of the tide components are increasing functions of their frequencies (as in Darwin&apos;s theory), but not small quantities. The amplitudes of the tide components depend on the viscosity of the body and on their frequencies; they are not constants. The resulting stationary rotations (often called pseudo-synchronous) have an excess velocity roughly proportional to 6ne 2 /(χ 2 + χ −2) (χ is the mean-motion in units of one critical frequency-the relaxation factor-inversely proportional to the viscosity) instead of the exact 6ne 2 of standard theories. The dissipation in the pseudo-synchronous solution is inversely proportional to (χ + χ −1); thus, in the inviscid limit, it is roughly proportional to the frequency (as in standard theories), but that behavior is inverted when the viscosity is high and the tide frequency larger than the critical frequency. For free rotating bodies, the dissipation is given by the same law, but now χ is the frequency of the semi-diurnal tide in units of the critical frequency. This approach fails, however, to reproduce the actual tidal lags on Earth. In this case, to reconcile theory and observations, we need to assume the existence of an elastic tide superposed to the creeping tide. The theory is applied to several Solar System and extrasolar bodies and currently available data are used to estimate the relaxation factor γ (i.e. the critical frequency) of these bodies. attain its maximum theoretical extent; that is, k 1 /k 0 &lt; 1 and the resulting excess of angular velocity is smaller than 6ne 2. However, as in the discussion above, without physical grounds to support the chosen value of k 1 , the result will depend on ad hoc fixed values.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>During the 20 th century, many versions of the Darwin theory, or of what has been called Darwin theory, were used in the study of the tidal evolution of satellites and planets (see reviews in <ref type="bibr">Lin, 2004, Efroimsky and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Williams, 2009)</ref>. Those versions were not exempt of problems, the more important appearing when they are used to study solutions near the spin-orbit resonance. All of them, consistently, show the existence of a stationary solution, which is synchronous when the two bodies move in circular orbits or super-synchronous otherwise (that is, a solution in which the time average of the rotation angular velocity is constant and slightly higher than the orbital mean motion; it is often called pseudo-synchronous). The excess of angular velocity in the stationary solution when the bodies are in elliptical orbits is physically expected. The torques acting on the bodies are inversely proportional to a great power of the distance and, therefore, much larger when the body is at the pericenter of the relative orbit than in other parts of the orbit. As a consequence, the angular velocity near the pericenter will enter in the time averages with a larger weight and will dominate the result leading to averages Instituto de Astronomia Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas Universidade de São Paulo, Brasil sylvio <ref type="bibr">[at]</ref> usp.br larger than the mean motion n. Then, in the case of a planet or satellite moving around its primary in an elliptic orbit, we should not expect the synchronization of the two motions. Pure tidal theories lead to synchronous stationary solutions only in the circular approximation. In standard Darwin theories 1 , in the usual approximation in which only the main zonal harmonic is considered, the average excess of angular velocity of the body is given by ∼ 6ne 2 (e is the orbit eccentricity) <ref type="bibr">(See Goldreich and Peale, 1966, eqn. 24)</ref>. This is a quantity independent of the nature of the body and is thus one important difficulty of these theories.</p><p>This prediction is, however, not confirmed by the observation of planetary satellites. Titan, for example, should then have a synodic rotation period of about 8.5 years (i.e. ∼ 43 • per year) while the radar observations done with the space probe Cassini over several years showed that the actual rotation differs from the synchronous spin by a shift of ∼ 0.12 • per year in apparent longitude ( <ref type="bibr">Stiles et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Stiles et al. , 2010</ref> 2 . In the case of Europa, the value predicted by the standard theory is less than 20 years. The present position of some cycloidal cracks confirms a non-synchronous rotation, but the comparison of Voyager and Galileo images indicate a synodic period less than 12,000 years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hoppa et al. 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Greenberg et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Hurford et al. 2007</ref>). The most striking case is the Moon whose average rotation and orbit are synchronous notwithstanding an orbital eccentricity 0.055.</p><p>The only way to conciliate theory and observation is to assume that in all these cases an extra torque able to counterbalance the tidal torque is acting on the body, and the most obvious assumption concerning this extra torque is the existence of a permanent equatorial asymmetry of the body ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Greenberg and Weidenschilling, 1984)</ref>. This can explain the case of the Moon and a quick calculation including the tides raised by the Earth and the C 31 component of the lunar potential result in a spin-orbit synchronous solution; the net effect of the tides is just a deviation of the symmetry axis which is not pointing to the Earth but shows a small offset (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ferraz-Mello et al (2008)</ref>, eqn 46). In the case of Titan and Europa, the situation is more complex. In both cases, we may assume a permanent equatorial asymmetry, but the resulting solution is then an exact synchronization, not a slightly non-synchronous rotation as some observations seem to show.</p><p>Several attempts were made to explain these differences either by assuming ad hoc mass distributions inside these bodies, or by modifying the Darwinian theories. Since the 6ne 2 law results from the theory when the lags are assumed to be small and proportional to the frequency of the tide components, one immediate idea is to substitute the linear dependence by a power law (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sears et al. 1993</ref>). However, without physical grounds to support the assumption, the result will depend on the ad hoc fixed powers and remain only speculative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Efroimsky and Lainey (2007)</ref> have proposed to substitute the linear law by an inverse power law. The grounds for their proposal are some laboratory measurements and also the determination of the dissipation affecting the Earth's seismic waves at different frequencies. An inverse power law brings with it an additional difficulty because any quantity inversely proportional to the frequency tends to infinity when the frequency goes to zero. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Efroimsky and Williams (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Efroimsky (2012)</ref> claim that this difficulty can be circumvented, but it is done at the price of an extremely complex modeling. The results of this paper (Sec. 10.1) may help the understanding of what happens in the immediate neighborhood of the frequency zero and why no actual singularity exists.</p><p>A different approach was presented in Ferraz-Mello et al (2008)(hereafter FRH) in which the lags remain proportional to the frequencies, but the non-instantaneous response of the body to the tidal potential is taken into account. In that approach, the resulting excess of angular velocity is given by ∼ 6ne 2 (k 1 /k 0 ) where k 0 and k 1 denote the response factors of the body to the semi-diurnal and the monthly components of the tide, respectively 3 . These response factors are not equal. In the stationary condition, the frequency of the semi-diurnal component approaches 0 and k 0 approaches its maximum, the fluid Love number k f . On its turn, the response of the monthly component of the tide will depend on the viscosity of the body. If the viscosity is small, the body will respond faster and k 1 /k 0 ∼ 1. The result is again ∼ 6ne 2 . However, if the viscosity is large, the deformation of the body does not</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">A simple rheophysical model</head><p>The usual standard model considers an elastic tide and delays the tidal bulge by an ad hoc phase lag in order to take into account the body anelasticity. In this theory, we propose instead of that, a simple rheophysical model, the basis of which is shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 1</ref>. We consider one body of mass m and assume that, at a given time t, the surface of the body is a function ζ = ζ( ϕ * , θ * , t) where ζ is the distance of the surface points to the center of gravity of the body and ϕ * , θ * their longitudes and co-latitudes with respect to a reference system rotating with the body. In the same instant t, the body is under the action of a tidal potential due to one second body of mass M situated in its neighborhood. No hypothesis is being done on the relative importance of the two bodies. Both may play the role of the <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> Elements of the model: ζ is a section of the surface of the body at the time t; ρ is a section of the surface of the equilibrium spheroid at the same time.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ρ(ϕ * ,θ * ,t) ζ(ϕ * ,θ * ,t) ζ ρ−ζ O ^ ^ ^ ^</formula><p>central body and its satellite or hot planet. In actual applications, both cases have to be considered (see FRH Sec. 18).</p><p>Would the body m be inviscid, it would immediately change its shape to the equilibrium configuration. In the simplest case, the figure of equilibrium of it under the action of the tidal potential is a prolate Jeans spheroid ρ = ρ( ϕ * , θ * , t) (see Chandrasekhar 1969) whose major axis is directed along the line joining the centers of gravity of the two bodies. If a e , b e are the principal equatorial axes of the spheroid, its prolateness is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ǫ ρ = a e b e − 1 = 15 4 M m R e r 3<label>(1)</label></formula><p>(Tisserand, 1891) where R e is the mean equatorial radius of m and r the distance from M to m. Terms of second order with respect to ǫ ρ are neglected in this and in the following calculations. The adopted model is founded on the law</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">˙ ζ = γ(ρ − ζ).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The basic idea supporting this law is that because of the forces acting on the body (self-gravitation plus tide), its surface will tend to the equilibrium spheroid, but not instantaneously, and its instantaneous response (measured by ˙ ζ) will be proportional to the radial separation between it and the equilibrium spheroid, ρ − ζ. Eq. (2) is the equation of a Newtonian creep (see <ref type="bibr">Oswald, 2009, chap. 5)</ref> where the distance to the equilibrium was considered as proportional to the stress. It does not consider inertia or azimuthal motions, which may exist and should be considered in further studies. The superposed elastic tide whose existence stems from the comparison of the observed shape of the tidal deformations and the theory, is not included in the equations of the model because the force due to the elastic tide is radial and its torque is zero; it does not affect the rotation or the averaged work and eccentricity.</p><p>The relaxation factor γ is a radial deformation rate gradient and has dimension T −1 . It is γ = 0 in the case of a solid body and γ → ∞ in the case of an inviscid fluid. Between these two extremes, we have the viscous bodies, which, under stress relax towards the equilibrium, but not instantaneously.</p><p>We shall mention here the very similar equation used by Darwin in his first paper on the precession of a viscous Earth (Darwin 1877) 4 to define its rate of adjustment to a new form of equilibrium, soon extended to the study of tides (Darwin 1879) by means of a law similar to Eq. (2). However, in the later paper, he was rather interested in the ocean tides upon a yielding nucleus and was not satisfied with the results that he classed as fallacious. For unless the viscosity [of the Earth] was much larger than <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> Equatorial section of the equilibrium spheroid corresponding to the tide generated by M on m. Angles: α is the distance from the generic surface point to the vertex of the spheroid; v is the true anomaly of M; ̟ is the angle between the origin meridian of the body and the pericenter of the orbit of M;</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m M α v ϖ Origin ρ(ϕ * ) ϕ * ^</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">ϕ * = ̟ + v + α.</formula><p>that of pitch, the viscous sphere would comport itself sensibly like a perfect fluid, and the ocean tides would be quite insignificant. This is perhaps the reason for which he never went beyond the circular approximation later used (Darwin 1880) to introduce the tide lag and the tide height in the Earth model in the study of the secular changes of the orbit of the Moon and the changing rotation of the Earth.</p><p>It is also possible to obtain Eq. (2) by integrating a spherical approximation of the Navier-Stokes equation of a radial flow across the two surfaces, for very low Reynolds number (Stokes flow), a case in which the inertia terms can be neglected and the stress due to the non-equilibrium may be absorbed into the pressure terms (see <ref type="bibr">Happel and Brenner, 1980)</ref>. The boundary conditions are ˙ ζ = 0 at ζ = ρ. The pressure due to the body gravitation is given by the weight of the mass which lies above (or is missing below 5 ) the equilibrium surface, that is, −w(ζ − ρ); the modulus of the pressure gradient is the specific weight w.</p><p>This comparison allows us to see that the relaxation factor γ is related to the viscosity coefficient η through</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">γ = wR 2η = 3gm 8πR 2 η ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where g is the gravity at the surface of the body and R is its mean radius 6 .

It expresses the quality of the oscillator in keeping free oscillations alive. It is proportional to the proper frequency of the oscillator and vanishes when no elastic force is acting. Its extension to forced oscillations is not done without ambiguities and we do not use it in this theory. Nevertheless, the quality factor Q is widely used and, in the applications, we need to know how to express it in terms of the rheophysical parameters used here. However, it is worth emphasizing that the formulas given in this section are obtained by mere comparison of some equations of this theory with their equivalents in standard Darwin theories and are not valid out of the particular conditions in which they were established. We recall that, in standard theories, the quality factor Q and the tidal Love number k 2 cannot be separated one from another; in the following equations, k 2 is the tidal Love number and k f is the fluid Love number.</p><p>In standard theories, two different definitions of Q are used, one when the body is free rotating and another when it is trapped in a stationary pseudo-synchronous state.</p></div>

In FRH, we have considered the lag of the radial tide (ε 5 ) as equal to the lag of the monthly/annual tide (ε 2 ) since both have the same period in the case of a stationary rotating body.

In the case of planetary satellites, eccentricities are low and either the system is rotating or nearly synchronous and we may consider the two cases separately. However, in the case of exoplanets, eccentricities are often high and the choice of one of the two formulas to determine Q is a problem. Indeed, in the standard approach, if the eccentricity is large, the stationary rotation may have a period much smaller than the orbital period and the dissipation due to the semi-diurnal tide will not vanish as in true synchronous companions. As a consequence, tidal components with frequencies ν and n will contribute to the energy dissipation on the same foot making impossible to privilege one of them to define one quality factor.</p></div>

The values of Q for the monthly tide (combined with the very low k 2 of the Moon, 0.0301 cf. Williams et al.) gives γ = 2.0 ± 0.3 × 10 −9 Hz. The synodic period of the Moon corresponding to the above determinations of γ is larger than 5 Myr and indistinguishable from a true synchronous spin-orbit resonance.</p><p>The problem with this determination is the value found for the uniform viscosity: η = 2.3±0.3×10 18 Pa s, 4 − 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the values reported in the literature, which refer to the solid lithosphere. This seems to be one more indication in favor of the role played by a plastic lunar asthenosphere in tidal dissipation and is in agreement with the dramatic decrease of the seismic Q below the deep moonquake source region indicating the presence of a partial melt below this depth and that, likely, most of the solid body dissipation in the Moon occurs below 1150 km (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wieczorek et al. 2006</ref>). The alternative solution, corresponding to Darwin's regime, gives viscosity values yet smaller. The adoption of a more realistic value for the viscosity leads to a much smaller γ and a much larger synodic period, even when a permanent equatorial asymmetry of the Moon is neglected. The resulting γ is small enough to compensate the fact that n and e may have been larger in the past and to give a result consistent with the rotation indicated by the distribution of the craters on the Moon: a synchronous attitude lasting since the formation of the last great basin, 3.8 Gyrs ago (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wieczorek and Le Feuvre, 2009</ref>). However, a larger viscosity would also imply a larger Q, in contradiction with the above-mentioned determinations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Let us add that the annual tide cannot be studied with the Keplerian model used in this paper.

As the Moon, Titan behaves much like a solid body.

Considering the Love number k 2 = 0.46, there follows χ = 770, γ = 1.8 × 10 −7 Hz and η = 9 × 10 17 Pa s. All these values have error factors ∼ 2. The viscosity found is several orders of magnitude smaller than the viscosity of the Earth's lower mantle (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Karato, 2008)</ref>. This uniform value does not make a distinction between the various parts of the solid Earth and is expected to be smaller than the viscosity of the mantle. The result, however, allows us to solve the two-solution indetermination in the inversion of Q(χ). For instance, in the present case, the root corresponding to a Darwin's tide regime (γ ∼ 0.1 Hz) leads to viscosity values 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the above given one and can be excluded. The low viscosity found is an indication that the given γ is too large and that we should look for a creeping law leading to more dissipation in high frequencies, as it happens when the Andrade model is plugged in the modified standard theory as proposed by Efroimsky (2012).</p></div>

Indeed, all general mechanisms responsible for important eccentricity enhancement are related to events expected to occur in the early stages of the formation of the system (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Malmberg and Davies, 2009)</ref>. Therefore, in older systems, if eccentricities were not damped to zero, the variations due to the tidal evolution may have been below some limits. We note that the existence of several planets in these conditions 10 plays against hypothesizing that exceptional sources of significant enhancement may have existed in the recent story of each one of them. However, we emphasize that the two parameters considered in this analysis, age and eccentricity, are of difficult determination.</p><p>We have studied some of the CoRoT hot Jupiters in elliptic orbit.

This constraint added to the radial velocity measurements, allows a better determination of the eccentricity and the longitude of the pericenter than in the case of non-transiting planets where these parameters are to be determined based on hard-to-measure asymmetries of the radial velocity curve.</p></div>

There is only one case among the currently known ones that may give us some information. It is 55 Cnc e for which e = 0.057 +0.064 −0.041 . It belongs to a somewhat hierarchized system of 5 planets whose past evolution may be simulated from ad hoc initial conditions able to bring the system to its present situation.</p><p>Simulations with the standard theory (Mignard's torque) starting with arbitrary excited eccentricities showed that dissipation in 55 Cnc e drives the innermost planets (55 Cnc e and 55 Cnc b) to a stationary solution with aligned pericenters (secular mode I of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Michtchenko and Ferraz-Mello, 2001</ref>) and the eccentricity of 55 Cnc e falls to ∼ 0.003 in a time much shorter than the age of the system (which is 10.2 ± 2.5 Gyr). If Q &gt; 5500 (dissipation factor of the current "annual" tide), the damping to the equilibrium center of the secular dynamics is much slower allowing 55 Cnc e to be found at a larger eccentricity now.</p><p>The only other possible guess comes from the viscosity of CoRoT-7 b estimated by <ref type="bibr">Leger et al.

This result means that for CoRoT-7 b, χ &gt; 1 and Q grows with the frequency (Efroimsky-Lainey regime), one fact that should be taken into account in the simulations of the evolution of the system. If k 2 = 0.46 as for the Earth, then Q ′ = 3Q/2k 2 = 300, which is of the same order as the value 100 adopted by <ref type="bibr">Rodriguez et al.

In addition, some authors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Efroimsky, 2012</ref>) claim that in these bodies the actual lags do not obey the weak friction approximation where lag tangents are proportional to the frequencies, but have lags proportional to a negative power of the frequency.</p><p>In order to conciliate the theory and the observed tidal bulges in the Earth, we have to assume that the actual tide is not restricted to the component due to the creeping of the body under the tidal action, but has also a pure elastic component.

We see that for χ small, ε 0 grows with χ (as in Darwin's theory). However, in this model, it only grows up to reach a maximum and then decreases. We may compare these curves to the curve Q(χ) presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">fig. 4</ref> and remind of the popular use of the relation Q = 1/ε 0 in Darwinian theories. However, the matching is very imperfect: The minimum of Q happens for χ = 1 while the maximum of ε 0 happens for values of χ larger than 1, which increases indefinitely as λ tends to zero.</p><p>It is worth recalling that one of the difficulties created by the assumption that the actual tide lag is proportional to a negative power of the frequency happens when the frequency changes of sign. If no additional assumption is done, we just have a singularity with the tide lag tending to infinity or, at least, abrupt jumps between positive and negative values. This is not the case with the solution that results from the superposition of the elastic and creep tides. In this case, the transition from one side to another is smooth. The tide angle increases when the frequency decreases up to reach a maximum; after that point it quickly decreases up to cross zero with a finite derivative. The behavior in the negative side is just symmetrical (see fig7(c) ).</p><p>In addition, the agreement of fig 7(c) with the red curve of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> of Efroimsky <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2012)</ref> is noteworthy. Efroimsky's curve corresponds to the left half of fig7(c). The only differences are the reversed direction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">fig. 7(c)</ref> is drawn assuming that the frequency is decreasing as the time increases) and the use, by Efroimsky, of logarithmic scales.

It is important to emphasize that the frequency-dependent height of the tide has not been taken into account in the majority of modern tide theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jeffreys, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">MacDonald, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kaula. 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Singer, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mignard, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hut, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Murray and Dermott, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Laskar and Correia, 2004</ref>).

So, its introduction does not affect any of the results presented in previous sections</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">Conclusions</head><p>We will be brief in these conclusions. The rheophysical theory presented in this paper is yet incipient to justify a long discussion. However, even at this early stage, some results are noteworthy.</p><p>The first result concerns the problem that served as motivation for this investigation: the socalled pseudo-synchronous stationary rotation. In this theory, it is given by a law that depends on the viscosity of the body. In the limit γ → ∞ (or η → 0), the body behaves like a perfect fluid and the pseudo-synchronous stationary rotation happens exactly as in classical Darwin's theory. However, when γ ≪ n (e.g. in rocky bodies), no matter if the eccentricity is large or small, the stationary rotation is close to the true synchronous rotation. In the case of rocky bodies, the monthly/annual tide (due to eccentricity) does not create the strong torque responsible for the super-synchronicity of fluid bodies.</p><p>In the case of natural satellites, the reophysical theory allows us to obtain the excess of the rotation period and to determine the "length-of-day" (a.k.a synodic rotation period). The results are in agreement with the observed values. They were obtained without adding any torque due to some "permanent" equatorial asymmetry, which may indeed exist, but is not necessary to counterbalance the tidal torque.</p><p>The second result concerns dissipation. Energy dissipation appears proportional to (</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">ν γ + γ ν ) −1 .</formula><p>The maximum dissipation of a tide component is reached when its frequency equals γ and decreases symmetrically when ν is different of γ no matter if larger or smaller. When ν ≪ γ the energy dissipation is proportional to ν. This is what happens in giant planets and stars. When ν ≫ γ, the energy dissipation is inversely proportional to ν. This is the behavior of dissipation in rocky bodies as extensively discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Efroimsky and Lainey (2007)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Efroimsky and Williams (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Castillo-Rogez et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Efroimsky (2012)</ref>. We have taken some care writing these sentences to avoid privileging γ or ν. In fact, the relaxation factor γ plays a role of critical frequency and one body may behave in different ways under the action of two tidal components of different frequencies if one is larger and the other is smaller than the critical frequency γ. In table 1 we have included in one column the inverse of γ, to give a clearer idea of the location of this bifurcation, which, in some cases, is not very far from the periods of the actual stresses acting on the body. At this point, I would like to stress that we have not used the quality factor Q in the present theory. In standard theories, the quality factor Q is an ambiguously defined parameter. It is defined using the semi-diurnal tide in the case of a freely rotating body, but using the monthly/annual tide in the case of a pseudo-synchronous companion. In classical applications, these two cases are very distinct and we can handle the two different definitions. However, in the case of high-eccentricity exoplanets, this separation no longer occurs. The dissipation is shared in comparable parts by the semi-diurnal and the monthly/annual tide and we get different values of Q following we consider one tide component or another. The low-eccentricity equivalence formulas relating Q to γ and the values listed in table 1 only appear in this paper because it is important to have a bridge between standard theories and this new one. However, it is necessary to stress the fact that these formulas are just numerical bridges valid for low eccentricities and for the rotational states assumed to establish them. Strictly speaking, a universal relation between Q and γ does not exist. We also note that the tidal Love number k 2 has not been used in the equations of the creeping tide. Section 9 presents a short inventory of bodies in the Solar System and extrasolar. For each of them, the values of the relaxation factor γ and the uniform equivalent viscosity are derived on the grounds of the results obtained for them with standard theories. We stress the fact that the results shown allow the studied bodies to be divided into two groups. One group, including the planetary satellites and the terrestrial planets, in which the dissipation decreases when the frequency increases (Efroimsky-Lainey regime), and the other, including giant planets, hot Jupiters and stars, following Darwin's regime in which dissipation increases with the frequency.</p><p>At last, the Appendix discusses some accuracy problems involved in tidal evolution theories. The warning included in FRH stating that long series expansions by themselves are not improvements of a physical theory has been several times misunderstood and criticized (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Leconte et al. 2011</ref>). However, we repeat it. Very-high-order expansions did create, in the past, the feeling that the results of standard Darwin theory were exact notwithstanding the fact that we cannot yet say that we understand the Physics ruling bodily tides. Indeed, we guess that the results of the standard Darwin theory for the pseudo-synchronous stationary rotation of close-in companions, independent of the viscosity of the body, cannot be correct, even when written using endless series.</p><p>On the negative side, the main question is that the rheophysical theory failed to give the actual shape of the bodily tide observed in the Earth. This failure forced us to admit the existence of a superposed elastic tide, which affects the shape of the observed tide but which is torque free and thus does not change the results of the rheophysical theory in what concerns the rotation of the bodies and the average energy dissipation. This superposition of the creeping tide and an elastic tide is a question that certainly needs to be stated in terms of Physics.</p><p>In addition, we can devise many other points in which the theory needs to be improved. We list a few of them: We have considered only homogeneous bodies; we have considered a non-rotating model for the equilibrium tide (a Jeans spheroid); we have considered only the planar (two-dimensional) problem; we have disregarded inertia and the non-linearity of actual creep laws; we have assumed tidal deformations small enough so as to allow a superposition principle to be used in the calculation of the potential spanned by the tidally deformed body, etc. In that sense, the presented theory is yet a proposed model. Each of the cited points deserves now to be taken into consideration, and shall be taken into consideration if we want to apply the theory to bodies as intricate as some planetary satellites. One positive point to be mentioned is that the theory opens the way for the construction of very complex models and to adopt laws more complete than the Newtonian creep law. Once the basic equations are given, they can be solved numerically. This means that we may adopt physical models as complex as necessary, no matter if their equations can be solved analytically or not.</p><p>At last, we have to emphasize that the approach developed in this paper is a new and complete theory of the bodily tide problem, whose results derive from only one physical law: the Newtonian creep. There are no ad hoc lags plugged by hand as in the standard theories. The constants σ i appearing in the arguments of the trigonometric functions, which can be physically interpreted as delays, are well determined parameters of the exact solution of simple ordinary differential equations. The results show some discrepancies with respect to the classical theories, but also some coincidences. The way in which creep and elastic tides combine to give rise to geodetic lags increasing when the frequency decreases, for hard bodies is appealing and may serve as a justification to the modern theories of Efroimsky and collaborators. In what concerns the discrepancies, it is important to know if they refer to observable phenomena or not. When observational data do not exist, it is impossible to know whether a proposed theory is or not correct. The approximations adopted in Sec. 3 may be enough for most purposes. They are certainly enough for low eccentricities. For high eccentricities, however, a different approach is necessary. Cayley expansions include in their derivation the Taylor expansion of the solution of Kepler's equation, whose convergence radius is e * = 0. <ref type="bibr">6627434... (see Wintner, 1941)</ref>. Some simple comparisons allow us to see that for eccentricities of the order of 0.5, or even less, the results are not accurate. Since the equations appearing in this paper are written in terms of one of the families of Cayley expansions, the power series may be substituted by eq. 16 in the form </p><p>We may note that the function under the integral involves both the mean (ℓ) and the true (v) anomalies, but can be easily handled numerically. The only difference with eq. (16) is the preference in having the integration done over the true anomaly instead of being done over the mean anomaly (via the classical expression r 2 dv = a 2 √ 1 − e 2 dℓ) to avoid having to solve the Kepler equation, which is operationally expensive. The integral solves the problem of the accuracy in the determination of the Cayley coefficients, but not that of the Fourier series giving the variation of the elements. To obtain approximations valid in high eccentricities, it is necessary to use expansions not affected by the singularities of the Keplerian motion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ferraz-Mello and Sato, 1989)</ref>. However, one preliminary guess can be done comparing different approximations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> shows the value of | ˙ e| for close-in companions in pseudo-synchronous stationary rotation, in arbitrary units, considering the sum of the eccentricity-dependent terms of Eqn. 49 truncated at N = 7, 20, 50 and 100, respectively. The abrupt changes of the curves with respect to the next one show a limiting eccentricity in each case. For instance the series truncated at N = 7 (the usual cutoff of Cayley series) give wrong results for eccentricities above 0.4. It is important to stress that the calculations showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">fig. 5</ref>, concerning the tidal evolution predicted by the standard Darwin theory are not affected by truncation effects since for that sake we have used Mignard's formulation whose basic equations are given in closed form <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mignard, 1979</ref>) without resorting to any expansions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3 Main component of ζ(</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> I will have to refer often in this paper to theories derived from Darwin&apos;s theory. To use a simple label, I will use the word &quot;standard Darwin theories&quot;, or, for short, &quot;standard theories&quot;, to denote all Darwin-like theories in which an elastic tide is delayed by lags assumed small and proportional to frequencies. 2 A re-analysis of the data by Meriggiola and Iess (Meriggiola, 2012) has not showed discrepancy from a synchronous motion larger than 0.02 • per year 3 We use in this paper the same tide component names used for fast rotating bodies (Type I of FRH) regardless of its actual rotation speed. In next sections we use the names monthly and/or annual for tidal components with the same period as the orbital motion.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> We may paraphrase one of Darwin&apos;s statements by just changing the symbols used in it by those shown inside brackets: But because of the Earth&apos;s viscosity, [ζ] always tends to approach [ρ]. The stresses introduced in the Earth by the want of coincidence of [ζ] with [ρ] vary as [ρ − ζ] . Also the amount of flow of a viscous fluid, in a small interval of time, varies jointly as that interval and the stress. Hence the linear velocity (on the map), with which [ζ] approaches [ρ], varies as [ρ − ζ]. Let this velocity be [γ(ρ − ζ)], where [γ] depends on the viscosity of the Earth, decreasing as the viscosity increases.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> This does not mean that a negative mass is being assigned to void spaces; it means just that the forces included in the calculation of the equilibrium figure need to be subtracted when the masses creating them are no longer there. 6 Darwin (1879) used a very complete construction of the Navier-Stokes equations and, in his results, the numerical factor is 3/38 instead of 3/8. His numerical factor is determined by the spheroidal form of the tidal potential, but the intensity of the potential does not appear in the result. So, his result would hold even for an infinitesimal tide!</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> The subscripts used for the σ k are not the same subscripts used in FRH for their homologous lags ε k .</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> In standard theories using Love numbers, often k f is substituted by some smaller value to take into account the rigidity of the body. Here, a substitution of this kind is not allowed since k f is just being used as a convenient substitute for A.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="9"> In the Efroimsky-Layney regime, Q increases with the relative frequency χ of the tide component and then increases when the critical frequency γ decreases.</note>
