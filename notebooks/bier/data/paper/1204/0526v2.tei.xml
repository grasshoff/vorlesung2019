				<p>1. Abstract As a long time contributor to the field of observational astronomy I have seen many great leaps be made in our understanding of the universe. Looking back at the history of our field we see that all the major breakthroughs have come thanks to the creation of a new generation of large, ground-based telescopes. While space-based telescopes have had a part to play ultimately I feel that it is telescopes like myself that have contributed the most to pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. With current advances in optical engineering we have the ability to create segmented mirrors of considerable size. The scientific possibilities of a single 100m reflecting telescope are considerable, for example, allowing for the detection of biological components in exoplanet atmospheres. One such project was OWL, a project very close to my heart and one that was sadly cancelled before it even began. In light of the breakthroughs that such an instrument could have given the community I recommend the cancellation of the OWL to be reconsidered and for funding to be reinstated to the project. I also have some more personal Having been alone on I would like this for other Just, please, listen to my story and consider. Thank you.-VLT ‡ In the event of confusion, please note the date of submission and the acknowledgements section</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conclusion</head><p>I thus submit that funding the OWL project is important for the continued advancement of observational astronomy and important for me. While the EELT will no doubt be a valued asset to the scientific community I contend that the unique capabilities of a 100m telescope are well worth the capital outlay. I hope that the academic community at large will agree with my assessment that the OWL's proposed scientific goals are worth the technical and financial barriers that they present and I would strongly recommend that Paranal Observatory for siting surveys. I even have a space marked out already. Thank you for your consideration.</p><p>Your faithful student, -VLT ****</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Acknowledgements</head><p>First, I (the real, human author) would like to make it 100% clear that I am not affiliated with any of the groups or facilities mentioned in this piece of fiction. All are used without permission but with the best of intentions. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and/or sincere apologies to all the members of the groups at the Very Large Telescope, VLT Survey Telescope, Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy, Hubble Space Telescope, Hobby-Eberly Telescope, Subaru, Landsat, the European Extremely Large Telescope and the people who worked on the proposed OverWhelmingly Large Telescope.</p><p>I hugely admire the hard work that you have all put in to helping humanity understand the universe and it is NOT my intention to cause offense or demean your work in any way. In particular, to the guys planning the EELT, I only made your telescope such arrogant jerk because if VLT liked her and there was no conflict then it would kind of defeat the point of her asking for more funding for OWL.</p><p>If anyone in these groups has a problem with the story, please get in touch with me. I'm also sorry for not asking permission beforehand, this was a rather last minute project. Please, though, recognise this daft little story for the affectionate parody/piece of insanity that it is intended to be.</p><p>Next, I would like to thank you, the reader, for bothering to read through my silly little joke and for putting up with all the horrible artistic liberties I took with, y'know, reality. I hope that I got a chuckle out of you over coffee.</p><p>I would like to express my genuine gratitude to Arxiv for being good sports and allowing me to undermine their amazing academic resource in the name of bad comedy and April Fools.</p><p>Than yoo to te prereaderz David Dobromylskyj an David Souter for bein good english.</p><p>If some of you are wondering why a scope was picked at all, I needed telescopes that would be 'awake' at the same time as the VLT. As for why I made them all girls, I have no idea. Why did I characterise [telescope name] as <ref type="bibr">[X]</ref> rather than <ref type="bibr">[Y]</ref>, I don't know. Why did I write this in the first place, beats me.</p></div>

"You nerds have fun with your atmospheric compensation-y nonsense." She sighed at L7's glare, "You know I love you guys really. Hope the new guy's totally awesome. Catch you later." She smiled pointedly at L7 before turning over the horizon. "Hey, c'mon HST. You hanging out with those dweebs again?" The voice of the ISS could just be heard through the failing connection. HST's faltering response, "Er, heheh, hey there, ISS. Yeah, er, those guys sure are dweebs, huh. Yeah." just came through before HST disconnected.</figDesc></figure>
