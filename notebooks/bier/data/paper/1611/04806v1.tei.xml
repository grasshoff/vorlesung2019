				<p>Context. Atmospheric tides can strongly affect the rotational dynamics of planets. In the family of Earth-like planets, such as Venus, this physical mechanism coupled with solid tides makes the angular velocity evolve over long timescales and determines the equilibrium configurations of their spin. Aims. Contrary to the solid core, the atmosphere of a planet is submitted to both tidal gravitational potential and insolation flux coming from the star. The complex response of the gas is intrinsically linked to its physical properties. This dependence has to be characterized and quantified for an application to the large variety of extrasolar planetary systems. Methods. We develop a theoretical global model where radiative losses, which are predominant in slowly rotating atmospheres, are taken into account. We analytically compute the perturbation of pressure, density, temperature and velocity field caused by a thermo-gravitational tidal perturbation. From these quantities, we deduce the expressions of atmospheric Love numbers and tidal torque exerted on the fluid shell by the star. The equations are written for the general case of a thick envelope and the simplified one of a thin isothermal atmosphere. Results. The dynamics of atmospheric tides depends on the frequency regime of the tidal perturbation: the thermal regime near synchronization and the dynamical regime characterizing fast-rotating planets. Gravitational and thermal perturbations imply different responses of the fluid, i.e. gravitational tides and thermal tides, which are clearly identified. The dependence of the torque on the tidal frequency is quantified using the analytic expressions of the model for Earth-like and Venus-like exoplanets and is in good agreement with the results given by Global Climate Models (GCM) simulations. Introducing dissipative processes such as radiation regularizes the tidal response of the atmosphere, otherwise it is singular at synchronization. Conclusions. We demonstrate the important role played by the physical and dynamical properties of a super-Earth atmosphere (e.g. Coriolis, stratification, basic pressure, density, temperature, radiative emission) in the response of this latter to a tidal perturbation. We point out the key parameters defining tidal regimes (e.g. inertia, Brunt-Väisälä, radiative frequencies, tidal frequency) and characterize the behaviour of the fluid shell in the dissipative regime, which could not be studied without considering the radiative losses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the pioneering work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kelvin (1863)</ref> about the gravitationally forced elongation of a solid spherical shell, tides have been recognized as a phenomenon of major importance in celestial mechanics. They are actually one of the key mechanisms involved in the evolution of planetary systems over long timescales. Because they affect both stars and planets, tides introduce a complex dynamical coupling between all the bodies that compose a system. This coupling results from the mutual interactions of bodies and is tightly bound to their internal physics. Solid tides have been studied for long (see the reference works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Love 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goldreich &amp; Soter 1966)</ref>. The corresponding tidal dissipation, which is caused by viscous friction, can have a strong impact on the orbital elements of a planet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mignard 1979</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mignard , 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hut 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hut , 1981</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Neron <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">de Surgy &amp; Laskar 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Henning et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Remus et al. 2012</ref>). This evolution depends smoothly on the tidal frequency (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Efroimsky &amp; Lainey 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Greenberg 2009</ref>). Fluid tides cause internal dissipation as well as solid tides, and the energy dissipated is even more dependent on the tidal frequency than the latter because of a highly resonant behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ogilvie 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Auclair Desrotour et al. 2015</ref>). As a consequence, in both cases, the phase shifted elongation of the shell induces a tidal torque which modifies the rotational dynamics of the body. This torque drives the evolution of the spin of planets and determines its possible states of equilibrium <ref type="bibr">(Gold &amp; Soter 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dobrovolskis &amp; Ingersoll 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia &amp; Laskar 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cor- reia &amp; Laskar 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Arras &amp; Socrates 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Correia et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>The advent of exoplanets over the past two decades and the rapidly increasing number of discovered planetary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Perryman 2011</ref>) have brought to light a huge diversity of existing orbital structures that can strongly differ from the one of the Solar system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fabrycky et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, tidal effects now need to be studied in a general context to characterize these new systems, understand their orbital and rotational dynamics, and constrain the physics of exoplanets with the informations provided by observational In this work, we focus on Earth-like exoplanets, which are interesting for their complex internal structure and possible habitability. Indeed, a planet such as the Earth or Venus, is composed of several solid and fluid layers with different physical properties, which implies that the tidal response of a layer cannot be simply correlated to its size. For instance, the Earth's ocean, in spite of its very small depth compared to the Earth's radius, is responsible for most of the tidal dissipation of the planet <ref type="bibr">(Webb 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Egbert &amp; Ray 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ray et al. 2001</ref>). The atmospheric envelope of a terrestrial exoplanet sometimes represents a non-negligible fraction of its mass (about 20 % in the case of small Neptune-like bodies). It is also a layer of great complexity because it is submitted to both tidal gravitational potentials due to other bodies and thermal forcing of the host star. Therefore, it is necessary to develop theoretical models of atmospheric tides with a reduced number of physical parameters if possible. These models will be useful tools to explore the domain of parameters, and to quantify the tidal torque exerted on the spin axis of a planet and quantities used in the orbital evolution of planetary systems. One of these quantities is the second-order Love number (k 2 ) introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Love (1911)</ref>, which measures the quadrupolar hydrostatic elongation. The adiabatic Love number k 2 has been estimated in the Solar System (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Konopliv &amp; Yoder 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lainey et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Williams et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wilkes (1949)</ref>, the first theoretical global models of atmospheric tides have been developed at the end of the eighteenth century by Laplace, who published them in Mécanique céleste (Laplace 1798). Laplace was interested in the case of an homogeneous atmosphere characterized by a constant pressure scale height and affected by tidal gravitational perturbations. He thus founded the classical theory of atmospheric tides. At the end of the nineteenth century, Lord Kelvin pointed out the unexpected importance of the Earth semidiurnal pressure oscillations in spite of the predominating diurnal perturbation (Kelvin 1882; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hagan et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Covey et al. 2009</ref>, see also the measures of the daily variation of temperature and pressure, on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13)</ref>. This question motivated many further studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lamb 1911</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lamb , 1932</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Taylor 1929</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Taylor , 1936</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pekeris 1937)</ref>, which contributed to enrich the classical theory of tides. In the sixties, theoretical models have been generalized to study other modes, like diurnal oscillations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Haurwitz 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kato 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lindzen 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lindzen , 1967a</ref><ref type="bibr">Lindzen ,b, 1968</ref>, but still remained focused on the case of the Earth. They revealed the impact of thermal tides due to Solar insolation by showing that these laters drive the Earth diurnal and semi-diurnal waves. Indeed, in the Earth atmosphere, the contribution of the tidal gravitational potential, which causes the elongation of solid layers, is negligible compared to the effect of the thermal forcing. A very detailed review of the general theory for thermal tides and of its history is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chapman &amp; Lindzen (1970)</ref>, denoted CL70 in the following (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Wilkes 1949;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Siebert 1961</ref>).</p><p>Leaning on this early work, we generalize here the existing theory to Earth-like planets and exoplanets. We introduce the mechanisms of radiative losses and thermal diffusion, which are usually not taken into account in geophysical models of atmospheric tides owing to their negligible effects on the Earth tidal response (note that radiation was however introduced with a Newtonian cooling by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lindzen &amp; McKenzie 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dickinson &amp; Geller 1968</ref>, from which the present work is inspired). These mechanisms cannot be ignored because they play a crucial role in the case of planets like Venus, that are very close to spin-orbit synchronization. Models based on perfect fluids hydrodynamics, such as the one detailed by CL70, fail to describe the atmospheric tidal response of such planets because they are singular at synchronization. In these models, the amplitude of perturbed quantities like pressure, density and temperature diverges at this point. The case of Venus was studied before by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia &amp; Laskar (2001)</ref>, who proposed for the tidal torque an empirical bi-parameter model describing two possible regimes: the regime of an atmosphere where dissipative processes can be ignored, far from synchronization, and its supposed regime at the vicinity of synchronization, where the perturbation is expected to annihilate. This behaviour was recently retrieved with GCM simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leconte et al. (2015)</ref>, who took into account dissipative mechanisms, thus showing that these mechanisms drive the response of planetary atmospheres in the neighborhood of synchronization.</p><p>Hence, our objective in this work is to propose a new theoretical global model controlled by a small number of physical parameters, which could be used to characterize the response of any exoplanet atmosphere to a general tidal perturbation. We aim at answering the key following questions:</p><p>‚ How does the amplitude of pressure, density, temperature, and velocity oscillations depend on the parameters of the system (i.e. rotation, stratification, radiative losses) ?</p><p>‚ What are the possible regimes for atmospheric tides ?</p><p>‚ How do Love numbers and tidal torques vary with tidal frequency ?</p><p>First, in Sect. 2, we derive the general theory for thick atmospheres, which are characterized by a depth comparable to the radius of the planet. In this framework, we expand the perturbed quantities in Fourier series in time and longitude and in series of Hough functions (Hough 1898) in latitude. This allows us to compute the equations giving the vertical structure of the atmospheric response to the tidal perturbation. Then, we derive from the hydrodynamics the analytic expressions of the variations of pressure, density, temperature, velocity field and displacement, for any mode. At the end of the section, the density oscillations obtained are used to compute the atmospheric tidal gravitational potential, the Love numbers and the tidal torque exerted on the spin axis of the planet. In Section 3, we apply the equations of Section 2 to the case of a thin isothermal stably-stratified atmosphere. In this simplified case, the terms associated with the curvature of the planet disappear and most of the parameters depending on the altitude, such as the pressure scale height of the atmosphere, become constant. In Section 4, we treat the case of slowly rotating convective atmospheres, such as near the ground in Venus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marov et al. 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seiff et al. 1980</ref>). In the next section, we derive the terms of thermal forcing from the Beer-Lambert law (Bouguer 1729; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Klett et al. 1760</ref>; Beer 1852) and the theory of temperature oscillations at the planetary surface. In Section 6, the model is applied to the Earth and Venus.</p><p>The corresponding torque and atmospheric Love numbers are computed from analytical equations. We end the study with a discussion and by giving our conclusions and prospects. To facilitate the reading, several technical issues have been deferred to the appendix where an index of notations is also provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dynamics of a thick atmosphere forced thermally and gravitationally</head><p>The reference book CL70 has set the bases of analytical approaches for atmospheric tides. This pioneering work focused on fast rotating telluric planets covered by a thin atmosphere, such as the Earth.</p><p>The goal of the present section is to generalize this work. Hence, we establish the equations that govern the dynamics of tides in a thick fluid shell in the whole range of tidal frequencies, from synchronization to fast rotation. We consider a spherical telluric planet of radius R covered by a stratified atmospheric layer of typical thickness H atm . The atmosphere rotates uniformly with the rocky part at the angular velocity Ω (the spin vector of the planet being denoted Ω). Therefore, the dynamics will be written in the natural equatorial reference frame rotating with the planet, R E;T : tO, X E , Y E , Z E u, where O is the center of the planet, X E and Y E define the equatorial plane and Z E " Ω{ |Ω|. We use the spherical basis pe r , e θ , e ϕ q and coordinates pr, θ, ϕq, where r is the radial coordinate, θ the colatitude and ϕ the longitude. As usual, t stands for the time. The atmosphere is assumed to be a perfect gas homogeneous in composition, of molar mass M, and stratified radially. Its pressure, density and temperature are denoted p, ρ and T respectively. For the sake of simplicity, all dissipative mechanisms, such as viscous friction and heat diffusion, are ignored except the radiative losses of the gas, which play an important role in the vicinity of synchronization. Tides are considered as a small perturbation around a global static equilibrium state. The basic pressure p 0 , density ρ 0 , and temperature T 0 , are supposed to vary with the radial coordinate only. The tidal response will be characterized by a combination of inertial waves, of typical frequency 2Ω, due to Coriolis acceleration, and gravity waves which are restored by the stable stratification. The typical frequency of these waves, the Brunt-Väisälä frequency (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lighthill 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gerkema &amp; Zimmerman 2008)</ref>, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N 2 " g " 1 Γ 1 p 0 d p 0 dr´1 dr´ dr´1 ρ 0 dρ 0 dr  ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Γ 1 " pB ln p 0 {B ln ρ 0 q S is the adiabatic exponent (the index S being the specific macroscopic entropy) and g the gravity.</p><p>We assume that the fluid follows the perfect gas law,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p " R s ρT,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R s " R GP {M is the so-called specific gas constant of the atmosphere, R GP " 8.3144621 J.moí1 .K ´1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mohr et al. 2012</ref>) being the molar gas constant. In the following, the notations , and˚willand˚and˚will be used to designate the real part, imaginary part and conjugate of a complex number. The subscript symbols C and B stand for the Earth and Venus respectively, which are taken as examples to illustrate the theory.

To simplify them, we assume the traditional approximation, that is to neglect the terms 2Ω sin θV r and 2Ω sin θV ϕ in Eqs. <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(8)</ref> respectively. This hypothesis, commonly used in literature dealing with planetary atmospheres and stars hydrodynamics (e.g. Eckart 1960; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mathis et al. 2008)</ref>, can be applied to stratified fluids where the tidal flow satisfies two conditions: (i) the buoyancy (given by gδρ{ρ 0 e r in Eq. 5) is strong compared to the Coriolis term (2Ω ^ V) and (ii) the tidal frequency (introduced below) is greater than the inertia frequency (2Ω) and smaller than the Brunt-Väisälä frequency. These conditions are satisfied by the Earth's atmosphere and fast rotating planets. The quantitative precision that can be expected with the traditional approximation may be decreased in the vicinity of synchronization, where the tidal frequency tends to zero ; moreover, we shall note that it leads to issues with momentum and energy conservation in the case of deep atmospheres (for a discussion about the limitations of the traditional approximation, see <ref type="bibr">Gerkema &amp; Shrira 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">White et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mathis 2009</ref>).</p><p>Hence, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">BV θ Bt´2Ω Bt´Bt´2Ω cos θV ϕ " ´ 1 r B Bθˆδp BθˆBθˆδp ρ 0 ` U ˙ ,<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">BV ϕ Bt`2Ω Bt`Bt`2Ω cos θV θ " ´ 1 r sin θ B Bϕˆδp BϕˆBϕˆδp ρ 0 ` U ˙ ,<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">ρ 0 BV r Bt " ´ Bδp Br´gδρ´ρ Br´Br´gδρBr´gδρ´Br´gδρ´ρ 0 BU Br .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>In strongly stratified fluids, the left-hand side of Eq.

We consider that J rad 9 δT . This hypothesis is known as "Newtonian cooling" and was used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lindzen &amp; McKenzie (1967)</ref> to introduce radiation analytically in the classical theory of atmospheric tides (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dickinson &amp; Geller 1968)</ref>. Physically, it corresponds to the case of an optically thin atmosphere in which the flux emitted by a layer propagates upward or downward without being absorbed by the other layers. In optically thick atmospheres, such as Venus' one <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lacis 1975)</ref>, this physical condition is not verified. Indeed, because of a stronger absorption, the power emitted by a layer is almost totally transmitted to the neighborhood. Therefore, this significant thermal coupling within the atmospheric shell should be ideally taken into account in a rigorous way, which would leads to great mathematical difficulties (e.g. complex radiative transfers, Laplacian operators) in our analytical approach. However, recent numerical simulations of thermal tides in optically thick atmospheres by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leconte et al. (2015)</ref> showed behaviour of the flow in good agreement with a modeling with a radiative cooling. Therefore, we assume in this work the Newtonian cooling as a first modeling of the action of radiation on atmospheric tides.

The first contribution, which is called "horizontal part" in this work, is a linear combination of the forcings U m,σ n and J m,σ n . It corresponds to the component of the response that does not depend on the tidal vertical displacement. The length scale of this horizontal component is the typical thickness of the atmosphere (H atm ). The other part, expressed as a function of Ψ m,σ n and called "vertical part", thus results from the tidal fluid motion along the vertical direction. In the following, we use the subscripts H ant V to designate the horizontal and vertical components.</p><p>As may be noted, polarization relations point out the necessity of taking into account dissipative processes to study tidal regimes close to synchronization. Indeed, without dissipation (σ 0 " 0), synchronization (σ " 0) is characterized by a singularity. The terms associated with the horizontal component, which are directly proportional to U m,σ n and J m,σ n , tend to infinity at σ Ñ 0. Terms in Ψ m,σ n and dΨ m,σ n {dr behave similarly, as demonstrated in the next section. These terms are highly oscillating along the vertical direction over the whole depth of the atmosphere in this frequency range becausěˇˆkbecausě becausěˇˆbecausěˇˆk n ˇ ˇ Ñ `8 when σ Ñ 0. Hence, radiation regularizes the behaviour around σ " 0 and damps the vertical oscillations of waves associated with the vertical component. Diffusion acts in the same way by flattening the oscillations of smallest length scales (L V;n ) (Press 1981; <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zahn et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mathis et al. 2008</ref>). We return to this point when we solve analytically the case of the isothermal atmosphere with constant profiles for the forcings (Sect. 3).</p><p>The whole spectrum of possible tidal regimes is represented on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>. The radiative regime (blue) characterizes a flow where thermal losses due to the linear Newtonian cooling (see the heat transport equation, Eq. 18) predominate. In the dynamic regime (orange), dissipation can be neglected because the system is governed by the Coriolis acceleration. Finally, the mixed-acoustic regime (red) corresponds to high tidal frequencies comparable to the Lamb frequency, given by Eq. (49). This regime marks the limit of the traditional approximation.</p></div>

According to <ref type="bibr">Arras &amp; Socrates (2010)</ref>, at the vicinity of synchronization, the vertical displacement of fluid due to the restoring effect of the Archimedean force (N 2 V r term in the heat transport equation, Eq. 14) compensates exactly the local density variations generated by the thermal forcing, which annihilates the quadrupolar tidal torque. We will observe this effect in Section 6 when considering the Earth's and a Venus-like planet atmospheres isothermal and stably-stratified (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14)</ref>. For a stably-stratified structure, the tidal torque exerted on the atmosphere is weak and cannot balance the solid torque, which leads the planet's spin to the synchronization configuration. We can note here that the importance of stable stratification has been pointed out for the case of Jupiter-like planets by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ioannou &amp; Lindzen (1993b)</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ioannou &amp; Lindzen 1993a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">, 1994</ref>, who showed that the atmospheric tidal response was very sensitive to variations of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency (N).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Comparison with CL70</head><p>The vertical wavenumber is a key-parameter of the tidal perturbation. Hence, to highlight the interest of taking into account dissipative mechanisms such as radiation, we consider the relative difference between thê k n given by Eq.

Relative difference between the complex wavenumber obtained in this work (Eq. 103) on the one hand, and the real one given by CL70 for Earth atmospheric tides ( ˆ k CL;n ) on the other hand. The difference η, given by Eq. (158), is plotted in logarithmic scale as a function of the normalized tidal frequency σ{σ 0 and of the ratio h c {h n . The color of the map, denoted c, is defined by the expression c " log pηq.

The positions of the planets are determined by the gravity mode of degree 0 in the case of the semidiurnal tide. Dark (luminous) regions correspond to the dynamic (dissipative) regime.

The supplementary term of Newtonian cooling in the heat transport equation induces an additional regime with respect to CL70. At low frequencies, around the radiation frequency, the vertical profiles are damped while they are highly oscillating in the case where σ 0 " 0. This thermal regime corresponds to the middle white-yellow region of the map. The two wavenumbers become similar for |σ| " σ 0 . This is the regime of fast rotating planets studied by CL70. Beyond the threshold materialized by the left and right edges of the map, which correspond to |σ| " N, the traditional approximation assumed in Section 2 is not valid any more and the coupling between the three components of the Navier-Stokes equation shall be considered. At the end, the area located at h c {h n « 1 represents the discontinuous transition between propagative and evanescent waves in CL70, this transition being regular in our model.</p></div>

This situation typically corresponds to Venus-like planets. Indeed, the rotation period of Venus, 243 days, is of the same order of magnitude as its orbital period. As a consequence |ν| ă 1 for the Venus' semi-diurnal tide and the restoring force of inertial waves, the Coriolis acceleration, can be neglected as a first step. The atmospheric layer located below 60 km is characterized by a strongly negative temperature gradient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seiff et al. 1980)</ref>. In this layer, the temperature decreases from 750 K to 250 K, which make it subject to convective instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baker et al. 2000)</ref>. Therefore, the Brunt-Väisälä frequency of Venus is far lower than the one given by the isothermal approximation. As this frequency represents the "stiffness" of the Archimedean force, which restores gravity waves, these laters cannot propagate in the unstable region above the surface.</p></div>

Nevertheless, it is necessary to establish physical expressions of the heat power per unit mass to compute a solution. The different contributions must be clearly identified.

The non-absorbed part of this flux reaches the ground and causes temperature oscillations at x " 0. This implies two contributions from the ground: a radiative emission in infrared and diffusive heating due to turbulences within the surface boundary layer.</p></div>

It results from the fact that vertical displacement of fluid induced by the stable stratification compensates the local density variations in this frequency regime and strongly flattens the total tidal torque. As demonstrated in Sect. 4, this is not the case in general and it depends on the strength of the stratification. In the case of a slowly rotating convective atmosphere (N 2 « 0) forced by a heating located at the ground, only the horizontal component remains.

However, there are some important differences compared to the case of the Earth. The Venusian atmosphere does not have the same properties as the Earth's atmosphere. First, the fluid layer is a hundred times more massive (denoting M the mass of the atmosphere, one has M B " 4.8 ˆ 10 20 kg while M C " 5.1 ˆ 10 18 kg). Thus, the surface pressure is around 93 bar.

While the spin frequency of the Earth is far much higher than its mean motion and the radiation frequency of its atmosphere, these three frequencies are of the same order of magnitude for Venus. Therefore, the Venusian semidiurnal thermal tide is characterized by a tidal frequency |σ| " σ 0 , which is typical of the thermal regime. The term describing radiative losses in the heat transport equation (Eq. 18) plays an important role in this regime by damping the profiles in altitude of the tidal response; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">figure 5</ref> illustrates that point. This figure shows that the imaginary part ofˆkofˆ ofˆk n , which is responsible for the damping, is always comparable to the real part in this frequency range.</p><p>Contrary to the case of the Earth, the semidiurnal thermal tide VenusX belongs to the family of super-inertial waves, with ν « 0.48. So the horizontal component of the tidal response is composed of gravity modes only. We can note that the surface variations of perturbed quantities, plotted on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>, are very well represented by the first mode. The patterns of the Hough functions Θ 2,ν 0 , L 2,ν θ Θ 2,ν 0 and L 2,ν ϕ Θ 2,ν 0 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>, red curves) clearly appear on the maps. Moreover, the lags of δp and δρ are different from the one observed in the Earth's semidiurnal tide. In particular, it is interesting to note that the pressure and density peaks are not superposed in this case. The effect of the damping caused by radiative losses can be observed in vertical cross-sections of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 18</ref>, where the variations of pressure and density are located close to the ground.

This approximation is relevant in strongly stably-stratified fluids where 2Ω ă |σ| ! N, but less appropriate if |σ| " 2Ω, as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mathis (2009)</ref>. Its validity domain, not well defined, remains essentially limited to the regime of super-inertial waves <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Prat et al. 2016</ref>). It is represented on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref>, which shows the cases that can be treated analytically (regions a and b). Concerning the importance of the neglected Coriolis terms, we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr">Gerkema &amp; Shrira (2005)</ref>, who explored the physics of gravito-inertial waves without the traditional approximation (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Tort &amp; Dubos 2014</ref>). The traditional approximation appears to be a relatively strong hypothesis because it prevents to treat the case of rotating convective atmospheres (N 2 « 0, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ogilvie &amp; Lin 2004</ref>). Convection is an important feature of the Earth's nearly adiabatic layer (altitudes below 2 km) as well as the Venus' atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Linkin et al. 1986</ref>). It has strong implications on the propagations of waves: gravity waves cannot exist in convective layers, which may significantly modify the tidal response, particularly if the convective turnover time is close to the period of the tidal forcing. In the general case, the effect of convection on the structure of waves can be studied either numerically with GCM ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21, d</ref>) or analytically with simplified models (e.g. based on a Cartesian geometry). The only exception for a global analytical study of a convective atmosphere is the case treated in Section 4, where stable stratification and rotation are rather weak to be neglected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 21, b)</ref>.  .

In Sect. 2 and 3, the equations have been linearized around the equilibrium. This method is only relevant in cases where the tidal response of the atmosphere can be considered as a small perturbation with respect to the equilibrium state. This condition is verified for the Earth and Venus.</p><p>‚ The solid rotation approximation. We supposed that the atmosphere rotates with the solid core uniformly. Thus, the atmospheric circulation (both meridional and zonal) is ignored. This approximation is justified by the fact that the most important pressure and density variations are concentrated in the densest layers, near the ground. Given that these layers are bound to the solid core by viscous friction, they rotate at the same spin frequency. However, tidal waves might interact with to the mean flow in cases where σ « 0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Goldreich &amp; Nicholson 1989</ref>) and it will be interesting to take into account the global atmospheric circulation in further works, as done in GCM simulations.</p><p>‚ The use of simplified atmospheric vertical structures. In order to lighten calculations, we considered the cases of uniform background temperature (isothermal stablystratified atmosphere) and temperature gradient (convective atmosphere), and supposed that some parameters, such as σ 0 , do not vary with altitude. These simplified structures are a first step towards more sophisticated ones. Owing to the importance of the stratification in the tidal response, it will be necessary to treat the cases of observed structures in future works; for instance, those of the Earth, Venus, and Mars atmospheres.</p><p>a Newtonian cooling. The linear dependence of the corresponding radiative term on the temperature perturbation can be interpreted as an optically thin layer approximation. Indeed, this term corresponds to the thermal behaviour of an atmosphere that would emit a grey body radiation towards space and the planet surface. Actually, the flux emitted is partly absorbed by the atmosphere itself, which induces a complex thermal coupling between the different layers of the atmosphere. This is true particularly for optically thick atmosphere. In these cases, the Newtonian cooling shall be seen as a convenient approximation of thermal radiation for an analytical approach, where the dissipative processes cannot be treated without approximations. This approach seems to be well validated by numerical simulations using GCM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leconte et al. 2015</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We have set the bases of a new theoretical framework to study the atmospheric tides of Earth-like exoplanets analytically. This work is complementary with numerical simulations. The main objective is to explain the qualitative behavior of an atmosphere submitted to both thermal and gravitational tidal perturbations and to explore the domain of key physical parameters. The laters, highlighted by the model, are</p><p>-the characteristic frequencies of the system (e.g. inertia, Brunt-Väisälä, radiative, boundary layer, tidal frequencies),</p><p>-the involved characteristic length scales (e.g. planetary radius, pressure height scale of the atmosphere, length scales of the vertical variations of tidal waves),</p><p>-the physical parameters of the planet (e.g. the molar mass of the atmosphere, the adiabatic exponent, the surface gravity, the surface pressure).</p><p>Using the equations of hydrodynamics, we have adapted the theoretical approach detailed in CL70 to thick dissipative atmospheric shells. We computed the analytic expressions of the horizontal and vertical structure equations, of the perturbed quantities (pressure, density, temperature, velocity, displacement), of Love numbers and tidal torques exerted on the atmosphere. These expressions have been used to identify the possible regimes of atmospheric tides: a non-dissipative Earth-like dynamical regime, characterizing fast rotating bodies and a dissipative Venus-like thermal regime, for planets near synchronization. The behaviours involved in both cases are very different. The dynamical regime corresponds to the case studied by CL70. In this regime, tidal waves are either oscillating or evanescent, depending of the equivalent depth (h n ) associated with the mode. In the radiative regime, they are both oscillating and evanescent and the perturbation can be strongly damped.</p><p>The tidal response of the atmosphere will also be affected by the nature of the tidal excitation. A predominating thermal forcing generates thermal tides. On the contrary, if the thermal energy brought to the fluid layer is negligible compared to the effect of the tidal gravitational potential, the perturbation belongs to the family of gravitational tides. This case has not been studied in this work but the vertical structure equation and polarization relations of the model clearly attest of a behaviour qualitatively different from the one observed for thermal tides. Finally, the tidal response of the atmospheric shell is obviously impacted by lower and upper boundary conditions. We showed for instance that a stress-free condition and a no-material-escape condition would not give the same vertical profiles of the perturbation. Similarly, the ground may affect temperature oscillations by introducing a delayed thermal forcing locally.</p><p>Finally, the results obtained for the tidal torque are in agreement with the GCM simulations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leconte et al. (2015)</ref>. This torque appears to be strongly dependent both on the tidal frequency and on the atmospheric structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 22)</ref>. In the case of stablystratified atmosphere, the tidal bulge vanishes at the vicinity of synchronization. As a consequence, the tidal torque exerted on the atmosphere is very weak and cannot balance the solid tidal torque, which should lead the planet to synchronization. On the contrary, if the stable stratification is sufficiently weak (weakly stratified or convective atmosphere), the atmospheric tidal torque can be strong. We recover in this case the Maxwell behaviour obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Leconte et al. (2015)</ref> numerically and described by the early model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Correia &amp; Laskar (2001)</ref>. This would lead planets to non-synchronized states.

This explains why these modes are not well represented by associated Legendre polynomials for high values of |ν|. waves in reference to the early studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rossby et al.

In the previous subsection, Eq. (A.1) highlights a symmetry between the two parameters defining these functions, m and ν. Hence, for m ą 0 and ν P R, where s " |m|. A first possible way to compute the coefficients C s,ν n,k and eigenvalues Λ s,ν n , described by CL70, consists in finding the roots of a high-degree polynomial (typically, the degree N of this polynomial corresponds to the number of coefficients of the series given by Eq. A.7). With the current computing resources, N " 500 can be reached easily. However, this method rapidly becomes tricky to apply beyond N " 500 because of very large polynomial coefficients. Since the size of the Λ s,ν n range depends on N, this particularity can limit the number of gravity modes or Rossby modes found. For instance, in the case of the Earth's semidiurnal tide, where ν is very close to 1, the first Rossby modes are characterized by strongly negative eigenvalues. Therefore, only few functions of this type can be computed. To address this issue, the previous problem may be written as an explicit eigenvalue problem. Hence, following Hough (1898) and CL70, we expand the non-normalized Hough functions˜Θtions˜ tions˜Θ s,ν n in non-normalized associated Legendre Polynomials, denoted˜Pdenoted˜ denoted˜P s k : To lighten expressions, the A s,ν n,k are simply denoted A s k in the following analytic development.

In this regime Hough functions are very similar to the associated Legendre polynomials. In the case ν " 0 (top left), the bases are exactly the same and the projection matrix is diagonal.</p><p>The sub-inertial regime is characterized by modes of both types, the transition being identified by Hough functions of the lowest degrees: Rossby modes on the left of the map (lowest eigenvalues) ; gravity modes on the right (highest eigenvalues). The maps reveal the side effect inherent to the spectral method. Hough functions of highest degrees are obviously not well represented by the family of associated Legendre Polynomials; more polynomials are necessary. This is explained by the asymptotial behaviour of Hough functions.

These quantities are the coefficients c 2,n,2 " xP 2 2 , Θ 2,ν n y 2 introduced in Eq. (81), which weight the contribution of Hough modes to the tidal torque, the eigenvalues of the Laplace's tidal equation (Λ m,ν n ), the length scale of vertical variations associated to Hough modes (L V;n ), the spin parameter (ν) and the real and imaginary parts of the complex vertical wavenumber ( ˆ k n denoted k n in plots), which determines the nature (propagative or evanescent) of tidal waves.

Indeed, one notes that the projection of the associated Legendre polynomial P 2 2 on Hough functions is not the same before and after the synchronization: the weigh of the gravity mode of degree 0, which is the most representative one, varies and Rossby modes are predominating in a very short interval of positive tidal frequencies. One retrieves this dissymmetry in the variations of the horizontal eigenvalues, where Rossby modes only appear for σ ą 0.</p><p>As predicted by its analytic expression (Eq. 102), the real and imaginary part of the vertical wavenumber diverge at the synchronization. Therefore, Hough modes become both highly oscillating and strongly damped in this region. Their spatial variation scale along the vertical direction decays, which corresponds to what is observed in the variations of L V;n . Actually, below a given typical length scale, these modes are damped by dissipative processes such as thermal diffusion. Finally, the graph of ν show that this parameter strongly varies around the synchronization. The transition at σ " 0 is discontinuous, ν switching from´8 from´8 tò8. We arbitrarily set k V " 100 p1ìqp1ìq in order to satisfy the condition L V ! 1 (let us recall that x sup " 10). This corresponds to a strongly damped tidal mode similar to those predicted by the model in a frequency range close to synchronization. The critical number of points necessary to compute the response with our scheme is then N crit " 400. We solve Eq. (G.1) for various resolutions. The corresponding results are plotted on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. G.1</ref>, where they are also compared to the analytical solution, given by Eq. (129). The flattening observed for N ă N crit gives an idea of the kind of numerical difficulties that shall be addressed to compute tidal low-frequency waves with a GCM. Particularly, this shows that if we compute the tidal torque numerically by using the scheme of Appendix B with an insufficient resolution, we will only be able to get the large scale contribution associated with the horizontal component (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. 14)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

The time is converted in solar time and the data averaged over an exact count of 365 days. The average value of temperature (10.8973 ˝ C) and pressure (1015.83 mbar) has been removed to display only the variable part. In both figures, the raw data (in green) has been decomposed in a Fourier series over the 24 h period, limited to 2 harmonics (blue), or 5 harmonics (red). Temperature is dominated by the diurnal component, with a maximum value around 14h26mn. The largest harmonics of the pressure variations is the semidiurnal term, followed by the diurnal term. Two pressure maxima can be observed, at 9h38mn and 22h07mn.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Application to the Earth and Venus</head><p>To illustrate the regimes identified and the dependence of the atmospheric response on the forcing frequency, we apply the model to the cases of the Earth's and Venus semidiurnal thermal tides assuming first for both planets isothermal stably-stratified atmospheres, as described by the equations of Sect. 3. Let us remind here that the atmosphere of Venus is not stably stratified but convective in regions close to the surface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seiff et al. 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al. 2000)</ref>, where the tidal mass redistribution is the most important <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dobrovolskis &amp; Ingersoll 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Shen &amp; Zhang 1990)</ref>. Nevertheless, examining the case of a stably-stratified isothermal atmosphere for a Venus-like planet will allow us to better understand in an academic framework the role of stratification and radiative losses in the tidal response. To make a clear difference between Venus and the studied stably-stratified Venus-like planet, we call the later "VenusX". For the sake of simplicity, we assume that planets orbit in their equatorial plane circularly. Hence, the tidal frequency 8 is given by σ " 2 pΩ´npΩ´pΩ´n orb q. One of the most crucial parameters of the model is the Newtonian cooling frequency (σ 0 ). This parameter varies over several orders of magnitude with the altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pollack &amp; Young 1975)</ref>. However,</p></div>

Several ways are possible to compute these functions. Here, we present two possible approaches: the finite differences method proposed in the Numerical recipes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Press et al. 1986</ref>) and detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lee &amp; Saio (1997)</ref> and a spectral method developed from the works of Hough (1898), <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Longuet-Higgins (1968)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chapman &amp; Lindzen (1970)</ref>.</p></div>

Even solutions satisfy Θ m,ν n p´µq " Θ m,ν n pµq, odd solutions Θ m,ν n p´µq " ´Θ m,ν n pµq. For the sake of simplicity, the parity of the subscript used in the notations corresponds to the parity of the associated function. The solutions belonging to one of these two families are all defined by the boundary condition applied at µ " 0: dΘ m,ν n {dµ " 0 for even solutions and Θ m,ν n " 0 for odd solutions. The operator L m,ν has two regular singular points, a permanent one at µ " 1 and an other one at µ " 1{ |ν| in the sub-inertial regime, characterized by |ν| ą 1 and, therefore, depending on the spin parameter.
