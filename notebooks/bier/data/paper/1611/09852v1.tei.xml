			<abstract>
				<p>NASA&apos;s K2 mission is observing tens of thousands of stars along the ecliptic, providing data suitable for large scale asteroseismic analyses to inform galactic archaeology studies. Its first campaign covered a field near the north galactic cap, a region never covered before by large asteroseismic-ensemble investigations, and was therefore of particular interest for exploring this part of our Galaxy. Here we report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission&apos;s &quot;North Galactic Cap&quot; campaign 1. Our consolidated analysis uses six independent methods to measure the global seismic properties, in particular the large frequency separation, and the frequency of maximum power. From the full target sample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red giants, a number comparable with estimates from galactic synthesis modeling. Thus, as a valuable by-product we find roughly 7500 stars to be dwarfs, which provide a sample well suited for galactic exoplanet occurrence studies because they originate from our simple and easily reproducible selection function. In addition, to facilitate the full potential of the data set for galactic archaeology we assess the detection completeness of our sample of oscillating red giants. We find the sample is at least near complete for stars with 40 ν max /µHz 270, and ν max,detect &lt; 2.6 × 10 6 · 2 −Kp µHz. There is a detection bias against helium core burning stars with ν max ∼ 30 µHz, affecting the number of measurements of ∆ν and possibly also ν max. Although we can detect oscillations down to Kp = 15, our campaign 1 sample lacks enough faint giants to assess the detection completeness for stars fainter than Kp ∼ 14.5.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>From the birth of Kepler's second-life mission, K2 <ref type="bibr">(How- ell et al. 2014</ref>), grew the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (GAP) ( <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. 2015</ref>). With this program we aim to measure convectively-driven, or solar-like, oscillations in tens of thousands of red giants using the high-precision photometry from K2. The asteroseismic imprint in the data combined with ground-based measurements of effective temperature and metallicity will allow us to infer stellar properties such as radius and mass, and hence distance and age, even for stars out to a few tens of kilo parsec ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mathur et al. 2016</ref>). This in turn will enable us to probe the structure and evolution of vast regions of the Galaxy not probed before by asteroseismic means (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Miglio et al. 2012</ref>). It has become clear that the power of such seismic-inferred galactic studies, depends strongly on how well we understand the target selection and the detection biases involved ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sharma et al. 2016</ref>). The K2 GAP target selection has been particularly designed to gain full control of the selection bias, and hence to mitigate some of the problems encountered using stars from CoRoT or the original Kepler mission. However, for the program to reach its full potential we also need to be able to predict any detection bias in the asteroseismology in order to make robust inferences based on galactic model comparisons.</p><p>In this paper, we present the seismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2 GAP in campaign 1 (C1), and release, to the community, the full seismic data set of the large frequency separation, ∆ν, and the frequency of maximum power, ν max . After an initial description of the target selection (Sect. 2), we give a brief overview of the methods used to measure the seismic properties (Sect.3), before presenting the results in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we assess the detection bias and its effect on the sample completeness before concluding in Sect. 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CAMPAIGN-1 TARGET SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS</head><p>Our prime targets are red giants. The advantage of red giants is that they are intrinsically bright and show larger amplitude oscillations compared to dwarfs. Oscillations can therefore be detected even for distant stars. Most giants also oscillate with frequencies that are well sampled by K2's main, long cadence, observation mode. This enables large numbers of stars to be observed as required to perform robust stellar population studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Target selection strategy</head><p>We deliberately follow a simple color-magnitude target selection to ensure reproducibility and to strengthen the synergy with the selection criteria of large-scale high-resolution spectroscopic surveys from ground such as APOGEE <ref type="bibr">(Ma- jewski et al. 2010)</ref>, and Galah <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(De Silva et al. 2015</ref>). Specifically, for C1 (proposal GO1059) <ref type="bibr">11</ref> we selected all stars with J − K &gt; 0.5 and 7 &lt; H &lt; 13 using 2MASS, and sorted our target list by H-band magnitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>) <ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Stars with J − K &gt; 0.5 already observed by <ref type="bibr">APOGEE (258)</ref> and RAVE (another 147) at the time of target selection were bumped up as top priority targets, and for those we allowed the eight stars fainter than H = 13 to enter our list. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1a</ref> shows log g versus T eff for a synthesized population of stars representative of the K2 C1 field, which we generated using the Galaxia Milky Way synthesis tool ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sharma et al. 2011</ref>). We have highlighted the stars that follow the K2 GAP selection function. It illustrates how our color-cut is the sweet spot to ensure we do not loose many helium-core burning red giants while not including too many main sequence and subgiant stars for which we can not detect oscillations with K2's long cadence mode. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b</ref> shows the expected giant fraction based on the Galaxia simulation, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref> shows the color-magnitude diagram of the K2-GAP-selected stars that were observed by K2.</p><p>Of the total 21,648 C1 targets observed by K2, 8,630 are on the K2 GAP target list. This number is further broken down into 8,385 stars explicitly sourced from our target list, hence following our selection approach, and 245 serendipitous stars sourced from other K2 observing programs, which are therefore following a different, and rather complex, selection function. We further note that there were 155 stars, randomly distributed in priority, among our top 8,540 ranked targets, which were not observed, hence resulting in the 8,385 observed K2 GAP-selected stars in total. The missing 155 stars represent an unbiased set, which were deselected by the mission be- cause they, or a saturated neighbor, were deemed too close to an edge of active silicon on the detector. Hence, they do not cause concern in terms of biasing the selection function. In summary, our color-magnitude selection can be regarded complete down to H = 12.9, corresponding to 14.5-16.5 in the Kepler band-pass, Kp, depending on color.</p><p>All K2 GAP targets were observed in the spacecraft's 29.4 minute long cadence mode for about 80 days from 2014 May 30 to 2014 Aug 21. We adopted the light curves from <ref type="bibr">Vander- burg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Vanderburg et al. (2015)</ref>, which we high-pass filtered and gap-filled following the approach by <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. (2015)</ref>. This approach should minimise the artifacts in the data caused by the near-regular firing of the on-board thrusters used to stabilise the spacecraft role angle every 6-hrs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Synergy with exoplanet research</head><p>Our color-magnitude selection is expected to include a significant fraction of dwarfs and subgiants, particularly for high Galactic latitude fields like C1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b)</ref>. Due to the simplicity of the selection function, these dwarfs and subgiants will form a unique subset to study exoplanet occurrence rates as a function of different stellar populations in our galaxy. The giant-dwarf classifications provided by our program will also be valuable to prevent biases when calculating planet occurrence rates, which sensitively depend on stellar classifications ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Burke et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our subsequent seismic analysis will show oscillations only in stars with roughly 1.9 &lt; log g &lt; 3.2 ( <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. 2015</ref>), but for stars with log g &lt; 1.9 we can expect to see the signature of granulation, which will reveal that they are intrinsically bright giants (Sect. 3). Hence, the stars with no detected oscillations or granulation will most likely be the dwarfs and subgiants that could be used for exoplanet occurrence rate studies. From a population synthesis model of our C1 selection using Galaxia ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sharma et al. 2011</ref>) we expect our sample to include about 7500 stars with log g &gt; 3.2, almost all dwarfs (log g &gt; 4.2) and only about 100 subgiant and low luminosity red giant branch stars (3.2 &lt; log g &lt; 4.2) (see Sect. 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">APPROACH AND METHODS</head><p>The range of oscillation frequencies detectable from a single campaign of K2 data is set by the length and the sampling rate of the time series, which defines the lower and upper frequency limits, respectively. These correspond to a range in ν max of ∼ 10-270 µHz ( <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. 2015</ref>), or roughly 1.9 &lt; log g &lt; 3.2. Because our selection approach includes stars outside this range, and because it is critical to understand the seismic detection bias for galactic archaeology purposes, it becomes particularly important that we assess robustly if a star is a giant, with 10 &lt; ν max /µHz &lt; 270, or not.</p><p>We receive 4,000-10,000 new K2 GAP targets for each campaign. With this rate of new stars to be analysed, and the need to robustly determine which of them are giants, calls for a new approach to analyse and consolidate the seismic results compared to previous analyses based on the Kepler field. Those analyses were focusing on providing measurements of stars that where clearly showing oscillations, assessed by the level of agreement between results from independent methods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hekker et al. 2011a</ref><ref type="bibr">Hekker et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pinsonneault et al. 2014</ref>). This approach is prone to favour/select stars with the clearest detections rather than selecting all stars, introducing a bias that is difficult to mimic in subsequent comparisons with galactic synthesis models.</p><p>Here we use six independent analysis pipelines (called CAN, COR, BHM, A2Z, SYD, and BAM) <ref type="bibr">13</ref> to analyse the light curves in order to extract the large frequency separation, ∆ν, and the frequency of maximum power, ν max (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chaplin &amp; Miglio 2013</ref>, for more discussion on those two observables). Except for BHM, we also measure the amplitude of the oscillations, or some equivalent measure of oscillation strength for validation purposes. Pipeline leads were asked to only return results that they trusted, because comparisons between pipelines would not be used to remove outliers. Instead, we rely on the combined set of results from all pipelines to generate a list of stars for which at least one pipeline was able to detect oscillations (meaning at least measure ν max ), and for that set to make careful visual inspections to verify if the stars indeed show signs of oscillations or granulation in the power spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Pipelines</head><p>In the following we describe briefly each pipeline and how some of them used post processing criteria to select the final sample of stars believed to show oscillations. It should be stressed that only three pipelines (CAN, BHM, and BAM) determine the likelihood of a star showing oscillations based purely on the power and time scale of the seismic (and granulation) signal. The others require a clear presence of a regular frequency pattern, from which ∆ν can be measured. The latter is a more strict criterion and hence leads to fewer detections of oscillating stars.</p><p>CAN uses the following Bayesian nested-sampling-based scheme for the fitting and estimation of the measurement uncertainties. First, the 'typical' time scale in the time series is found by fitting a sinc function to the auto-correlation function (ACF) of the time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kallinger et al. 2016)</ref>, and a χ 2 goodness of fit test is carried out. Then, it is evaluated if the rms of the time series is within a factor of five from the <ref type="bibr">13</ref> We refer to the pipelines with their commonly used nicknames. expected value given the ACF timescale, which makes use of an empirical rms-time scale relation (analogous to using an amplitude-ν max relation). If a star passes both the goodness of fit test and fall within the rms-time scale relation, it is accepted as a 'red giant candidate', for which the following, and most restrictive, step is performed. By fitting the power spectrum with and without a Gaussian (to account for an oscillation power excess) on top of the background, the Bayesian model evidence determines if the power excess is statistically significant or not. Here, the range in ν max for the location of the Gaussian is guided by the ACF time scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kallinger et al. 2016)</ref>. If a star is deemed to not show any significant power excess implies that the ν max from the fit cannot be trusted and the star is deemed a non-detection. To tension the number of accepted false positive against the number of reject true positives, the applied significance threshold was informed by visual inspection of the power spectra that felt close to the acceptance/rejection cut-off. This approach returned 1106 oscillating stars. The central three radial orders of the power excess is then fitted by a sequence of Lorentzian profiles representing oscillation modes and parameterised by the frequency of the central radial mode and a large and small frequency separation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kallinger et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kallinger et al. , 2014</ref>). However, the fit to extract ∆ν returned robust results only for a subset of the stars (583 stars).</p><p>COR: The method is the same as used for CoRoT or Kepler stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mosser &amp; Appourchaux 2009)</ref>. The large separation is detected first, from the autocorrelation of the time series computed as the Fourier spectrum of the filtered Fourier spectrum of the signal (EACF). A simple statistical test based on the H0 hypothesis is used to assess the significance of the ∆ν detection from the value of the EACF. In case of positive detection, the other global seismic parameters are determined. A star is regarded to show solar-like oscillations if its ∆ν, FWHM of the smoothed power excess, mean height of the power excess at ν max , and height of the background at ν max all closely follow the empirically calibrated mean relations as a function of ν max <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mosser et al. 2012</ref>). For K2, a special treatment is applied to cope with the spacecraft thruster firing frequency. It consists in using the empirical scaling relations with stronger constraints when ν max is found to be near the firing frequency or its harmonics. Uncertainties are calibrated functions of the EACF parameter (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mosser &amp; Appourchaux 2009</ref>, for details). COR returned results for all stars thought to provide robust ∆ν and ν max values (778 stars).</p><p>BHM uses a three-stage approach, described in detail in Elsworth (in prep.). To summarise: First, the white-noisesubtracted power spectrum is divided by a heavily smoothed version of the raw power spectrum, representing the noise profile, to create the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as function of frequency. The likelihood of each frequency bin representing just noise is then calculated according the H0 hypothesis. Next, we apply the H1 hypothesis to a series of overlapping frequency segments of gradually increasing central frequency along the SNR-spectrum. The width of each segment changes as function of its central frequency following the empirical oscillation power width-ν max relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mosser et al. (2012)</ref>. The combination of H0 and H1 is used to form an odds ratio of there being oscillation signal in a given segment. If a segment shows detection of oscillation power, the next two stages provide estimates of ν max and ∆ν. This part of the method follows largely the OCT method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hekker et al. (2010)</ref>, but with some extra selection criteria needed because of the short duration of the time series. For ∆ν, stringent tests are applied to mitigate against the measured ∆ν being corrupted by the frequency spacing between the radial and octupole modes. These tests meant that for many of the stars only the ν max values is considered reliable. In total 1031 stars have a robust measurement of ν max , while only 198 have also a ∆ν value.</p><p>A2Z+ is an improved version of the A2Z pipeline described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mathur et al. (2010)</ref>, but we refer to it in this paper simply as A2Z. It uses the same method as COR to determine a first estimate of ∆ν, and the frequency range where that signal is present, from which a collapsed echelle diagram is formed to determine the location of the radial modes. ν max is determined by fitting a Gaussian in top of the background to the power spectrum. The guess for granulation timescale used in the fit is based on the results from <ref type="bibr">Mathur et al. (2011)</ref>. For stars where the highest radial mode was statistically significant at the 99% level, ∆ν is recomputed from the power spectrum of the power spectrum (PS2) where the dipole modes are masked out. Here, we use only the central orders of the spectrum centered on the highest radial mode. The number of radial orders used is typically four but depends slightly on the signal-to-noise ratio and ν max . The power spectrum and echelle diagram are used to visually verify the ∆ν measurements, and only stars with convincing detections are kept. Finally, as a post-processing criteria, stars are kept only if the slope of a linear fit to the power spectrum in log-log space is steeper than -0.5. In order words, if the granulation signal is not clear the star is not expected to show clear oscillations either (and is most likely a dwarf or too faint giant with a white noise dominated spectrum). Uncertainties were computed with a weighted centroids method that depends on the frequency resolution in the PS2. Because we used the same number of orders around ν max for most stars, the relative uncertainties are generally very similar for the stars. A2Z returned ν max and ∆ν results for 673 stars.</p><p>SYD: This pipeline is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Huber et al. (2009)</ref>, and uses Monte-Carlo simulations to generate statistically perturbed spectra from which measurement uncertainties are estimated as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huber et al. (2011)</ref>. The pipeline does not include a statistical assessment of whether oscillations are present in the data. Hence, to automate the selection of robust detections we impose a number of post processing criteria. First, stars are kept only if the power spectrum is steep enough to show the presence of granulation, using the same criteria as A2Z. Secondly, the correlation between an empirical average model spectrum and the slightly smoothed collapsed power spectrum of the central four orders need to be above a certain cut-off value (to ensure a clear mode pattern revealing ∆ν). The correlation process follow that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Stello et al. (2016a)</ref>, and like CAN, the cut-off is informed by visual inspection of stars that are accepted versus rejected. Thirdly, the stars need to have a ∆ν within 30% of the average expected ∆ν from the ∆ν-ν max relation of ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stello et al. 2009</ref>). This cut was chosen based on the natural spread seen among the high signal-to-noise Kepler red giant sample ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stello et al. 2013</ref>). Finally, stars need to have an oscillation amplitude within a factor of two of the average fiducial amplitude-ν max trend seen for spectroscopically confirmed red giants from <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. (2015)</ref>. SYD returned results for all stars thought to provide robust values for both ∆ν and ν max (559 stars).</p><p>BAM: Like CAN, BAM uses a Bayesian MCMC scheme for fitting the background and the oscillation excess power hump in the frequency spectrum, and for estimation of the The 'Total' numbers are split into the three visual classification categories shown both as absolute numbers and in percent for each pipeline. Due to rounding, the percentages do not necessarily add to exactly 100%. 'Comb.' refers to stars with at least one pipeline detection. width, and center (ν max ) as free parameters. One set of priors are calculated from empirical correlations between the background parameters and ν max ; another prior is placed on the timescale ratio between the two background components; and a final set of priors link ν max to the Gaussian amplitude and width. These priors are then used to derive the (total prior) probability of finding the measured value of each fitted parameter. After fitting the model (of noise plus excess) to the power spectrum, BAM selects a star as an oscillator if: 1) the signal-to-background ratio at ν max is greater than 3.0, and 2) the total prior probability is within the 4-sigma confidence interval. Subsequently, ∆ν is determined by a least-squares fit to the folded spectrum using the 4∆ν-wide ν max -centered section of the spectrum with ∆ν as the folding frequency. The folded radial, dipole, and quadrupole mode regions are each modeled with a Lorentzian function. The uncertainty in ∆ν is estimated as the quadrature sum of the uncertainties on the mode widths and locations. ∆ν is returned for stars only if the probability of ∆ν and the mode visibilities are within 4σ of their expected values based on priors. BAM returned ν max for 951 stars and ∆ν for 759 stars. Some of the pipelines used here have previously been compared on the basis of Kepler data. Although they have improved since, and changes has been made to accommodate K2-specific issues, we refer the reader to such comparison papers for additional reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hekker et al. 2011b</ref><ref type="bibr">(Hekker et al. , 2012</ref>).</p></div>

The figures highlight statistical properties of the results including the natural biases between pipelines arising from the fact that each pipeline measures and hence defines the seismic observables in slightly different ways. Users for which the magnitude of these biases are important for their science are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the specific methods adopted by the pipelines and their comparisons (see references in Sect. 3.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Visual verification</head><p>We visually inspected power spectra for all 1262 pipelinedetected giants, and assigned them to one of three categories 'Yes', 'Maybe', or 'No', according to whether they showed oscillations and/or granulation. This is obviously a subjective approach, which in a sense takes a continuum of probabilities of a star showing oscillations and puts that into three bins. However, we did it such that 'Yes' meant we felt confident the star oscillated, while 'No' meant we were confident it did not oscillate below the Nyquist frequency. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows a sample representative of low (left panels), medium (centre panels), and high (right panels) ν max detections (by the pipelines). For each ν max case we show the resulting three different visual detection categories; except for the low ν max case, where there were no stars categorised as 'No' detections, for which we instead show a 'Maybe' case that straddle the No category.</p><p>To test the subjectivity of our visual inspection, we had two people look through the power spectra independently. Cross checking their results showed not a single case where one person said 'No' and the other said 'Yes', and there were only five borderline cases between neighboring categories, where one said 'Yes' or 'No' and the other said 'Maybe'. We therefore regard the result of the visual inspection as highly robust. A similar exercise had been implemented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stello et al. (2013)</ref>, also showing consistency between three independent people. We include the result of the visual detection verification in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and summarise how each pipeline performs relative to our visual inspection in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (in pure counts and percent). It is worth noting that despite the larger number of stars returned by CAN, BHM, and BAM, those samples seem to be of similar quality as the rest (high 'Yes' and low 'No' fractions).</p><p>Of the 1262 giants detected by at least one pipeline, we found 1100 in the 'Yes' category, 110 were assigned as 'Maybe', and 52 'No' detections. If we assume the 'Maybe' cases are all genuinely oscillating giants, just with low S/N ratios or with ν max outside the 10-270µHz range, this would suggest we have up to ∼ 1210 detections.</p><p>To further double check that the confirmed detections were in line in terms of their ν max values, we compared pipeline values with visual values. The latter was found by manually placing (and mouse-clicking) a cursor on interactive plots of power spectra at the location of ν max . The intrinsic uncertainty in performing this manual ν max localisation, of up to 30%, meant we could safely use them to identify clear out-   liers. It was encouraging to see only a handful of pipeline results were indicated as outliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Ensemble verification</head><p>One way to check that the ∆ν and ν max measurements originate from oscillations and not from spurious humps of excess power is to verify that the amplitude, or some sort of similar measure of mode oscillation strength, show a correlation with ν max as expected from scaling relations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Stello et al. 2007)</ref>, and empirically demonstrated for large samples of giants (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mosser et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huber et al. 2010</ref>). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 3</ref> we show mode strength versus ν max for the pipelines that return both quantities. All panels show correlations indicative of detections due to oscillations. We also indicate the visual verification results by different colored symbols. It is reassuring to see that the 'No' detections (red open symbols) fall predominantly in the narrow frequency ranges around the spacecraft's thruster firing frequency and its harmonics or very close to the Nyquist frequency. Due to an improvement in the spacecraft altitude control since campaign 3, we expect the thruster firing will have negligible impact on the data for later campaigns as evidenced by the clean C5-based data in <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. (2016b)</ref>. The 'Maybe' category is spread out more (magenta filled symbols), but often at extreme frequencies pushing the limit of what can be measured with the length and sampling of the K2 data. Or they are near the artifacts from thruster firings; although a significant fraction are between 20 and 30µHz which are probably helium-core burning stars or possibly artifacts at half the thruster firing frequency. These results show that the visual inspection provides valuable complementary information, which suggests that the pipelines only struggle in a limited range and mostly extreme ends of the parameter space.</p><p>To further investigate whether the seismic measurements agree with expectations, we show the ∆ν-ν max relation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, which is expected to be relatively tight both from scaling relations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Stello et al. 2009</ref>) and as demonstrated for large samples of giants (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hekker et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huber et al. 2010</ref>). From Kepler data we generally do not see stars outside the ±20 % range around the mean ∆ν-ν max relation (solid lines), which roughly encompasses a mass spread of 0.5-2.5M ⊙ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">COMPLETENESS OF SEISMIC SAMPLE</head><p>In the following we investigate to what extent our resulting sample of oscillating giants is affected by detection bias. Unlike <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. (2015)</ref> we do not have prior spectroscopic knowledge of the evolutionary state of our stars to guide this analysis. For a given non-detection we can therefore not be certain if it is outside the detectable frequency range or if it is just a very low S/N case. However, we have a much larger set of stars than in <ref type="bibr">Stello et al. (2015)</ref>, which should enable us to make inference on the presence of likely detection biases by comparing our samples of ∆ν and ν max detections, and in turn compare the latter sample with a synthesized population. The obvious caveat with the synthesized population will be its model dependency. But as long as the model is not grossly inaccurate we can reasonably assume only small detection biases could remain unnoticed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Completeness of ∆ν sample</head><p>Comparing the number of stars between <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> and 4 plotted in each panel, illustrates that more stars show evidence of oscillation excess power (a ν max measurement) than a clear frequency pattern from which ∆ν can be determined (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">also Tables 1 and 2</ref>). This is an inevitable consequence of the length of the time series, which is not long enough to fully resolve the mode patterns in some of the stars. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig- ure 5</ref> we show the histogram of stars with a visually verified ν max measurement (green), compared to those where we also have a ∆ν measurement (blue). It is evident that the problem of identifying ∆ν, affects the helium-core burning stars the most, particularly stars with ν max around 30µHz. This arises because they show more complex frequency spectra, and mode power is spread into more frequency bins, which are therefore each of lower amplitude, resulting in less clear mode patterns. Based on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> we conclude the sample of stars with both ∆ν and ν max measurements is biased at least for helium-core burning stars. It is not clear if that applies only to the helium-core burning stars that have ν max ∼ 30 µHz. The ∆ν detection bias is more severe for some pipelines where we see a clear lack of stars in the blue curve compared to the green curve (e.g. CAN), potentially affecting all stars with ν max 50 µHz. Looking at Hekker et al. (2011a) (their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) it seems that for 50-100 day Kepler time series, which brackets the 80-day K2 C1 series, there is a deficit of stars with ∆ν in the range 3-5µHz (equivalent to ν max ∼ 30 µHz) relative to the expected smooth decrease in detections for decreasing ∆ν (or ν max ). This is in qualitative agreement with what we see here for K2. We therefore recommend that the ∆ν detection bias for the potentially affected stars (ν max 50 µHz) be quantified specifically for K2 using the same pipelines as presented here before the ∆ν re-  sults of these stars are used for population studies. However, the reported ∆ν could of course still be used safely for other purposes (or indeed for population studies restricted to stars in the unaffected ν max range ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Completeness of ν max sample</head><p>5.2.1. Individual pipeline results Here, we will compare our number of detected giants with what one would expect from synthesizing our target sample. We note that while the total number of detected giants is up to 1210, they were found among all 8,630 observed stars in the K2 GAP list, rather than only the 8,385 that follow the K2 GAP selection (Section 2). Hence, about 30 of the detected giants are serendipitous from other K2 proposals, which should be subtracted before comparing with a synthesized sample <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . We use the Galaxy synthesis tool, Galaxia to synthesize our target sample of 8,385 stars by imposing the selection described in Section 2, and the ν max detection range of 10-270µHz. This results in an initial ∼ 1650 expected giants (within Poisson error) in the detectable ν max range, which is significantly larger than the number of giants actually detected. Hence, we want to investigate whether there might be any significant biases with respect to signal and/or noise. The signal is the oscillation amplitude for which ν max is a good proxy <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3)</ref>, while the noise can be approximated by brightness, Kp. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> we therefore show ν max and Kp for all visually inspected detections (green, magenta, and red symbols). The grey dots in the background show the synthesis population of 1650 expected giants. It is clear from this comparison that we can not detect oscillations in stars in the upper right corner, which are the faintest (more noisy), and the least evolved stars (highest ν max and hence lowest intrinsic oscillation amplitudes).</p><p>To assess if this apparent 'lack' of faint low luminosity red giants is expected, we need to take the oscillation detectability into account. We derive the detectability following the formulation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chaplin et al. (2011)</ref>. The stellar properties are given as part of the output from Galaxia, from which the oscillation and granulation signal is predicted. Different to  <ref type="formula">(2010)</ref> (dotted red curve), which matches the K2 noise floor quite well (grey dotted curve) when shifted up be a factor of two. However, this noise floor is clearly a lower limit even for photon noise dominated stars <ref type="bibr">(Kp 14)</ref>, which for the vast majority show a scatter that ranges a factor of four. We therefore adopt a larger and more representative noise level for K2 of three times the Kepler level (solid red curve). Now, taking our derived detectability into account, we expect to detect oscillations in only ∼ 1420 of the synthesis sample ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6, black dots)</ref>. This synthesis sub sample shows the same lack of stars as our observations in the top right corner in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> main panels. For added clarity <ref type="bibr">14</ref> In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> we have marked the stars that do not following the K2 GAP selection we also show histograms of the observed and synthesis distributions as function of ν max and Kp. The Kp distributions demonstrate a drop in stars occurs beyond Kp = 12.5-12.7 (green curve), which is similar to what is expected from the Galaxia distribution peaking at Kp = 12.7 − 13.0 (black curve). There seem to be a tendency for all pipelines to claim detections where no detection was verified by the visual inspection for stars fainter than <ref type="bibr">Kp ∼ 15 (red open sym- bols)</ref>. We therefore caution using these seismic results of stars fainter than Kp ≃ 14.5 for population studies due to potential completeness issues in the current sample of results. However, we note that the lack of luminous faint (Kp &gt; 15) giants in our C1 sample prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions about detection bias towards the faint end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2.">Combined pipeline results</head><p>Now we turn to the combined set of results, and show the sample distribution in ν max -Kp space in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Here we acknowledge that different pipelines have different strengths and by compiling all the stars for which at least one pipeline detected oscillations, we are more likely to obtain as many stars as possible in our sample. Hence, our sample will be more likely to contain, as closely as possible to, all detectable oscillating stars. For this part of our investigation we adopted ν max values first sourced from CAN, then we added those from A2Z not already in the CAN sample, then BHM, SYD, COR, and finally BAM, following the order of the pipeline with the most to least unique detections. By construction, not all stars in the compiled list have a ν max value from the same pipeline. However, for the purpose of investigating the completeness of the population as a whole, the relatively small ν max biases between different pipelines plays no important role (Appendix, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 17, 18)</ref>.</p><p>To use the sample for population studies one needs to take into account that we can not detect stars above the fiducial dotted curve, expressed by ν max,detect &lt; 2.6 × 10 6 · 2 −Kp µHz. We note that the curve seems to have a slightly steeper dependence on Kp than predicted (see black dots). The predicted dependence is close to ∝ 2 −0.4Kp as expected from the photon noise limit, and we attribute the steeper observed dependence to the fact that our adopted noise estimate becomes increasingly underestimated towards fainter stars; as opposed to bright stars where the photon noise plays no significant role in the detectability. In order words, our simple noise prescription does not take full account of the gradual transition between the two noise regimes and the intrinsic spread in the noise from star to star. It is therefore also difficult to make an accurate model prediction of the absolute number of expected detections. Changing the adopted noise level by about 30%, changes the number of expected detections by about 100 (with larger noise resulting in fewer expected detections).</p><p>From the distributions shown as histograms of different parts of the ν max -Kp parameter space we see that the discrepancy between observed and predicted number of stars seems to be more pronounced for ν max 40 µHz, which affects many helium-core burning stars. Here it shows about a 30% difference <ref type="figure">(Figure 8, right panels)</ref>. This difference could be due to both observation bias and errors in the Galactic model prediction including predictions of oscillation amplitude and noise. While observational detection bias of ν max would not be unexpected for the faintest stars, it is surprising to see the quite pronounced discrepancy for the bright stars. There were no strong indications of such pronounced discrepancies for the Kepler red giant sample based on two years of data The dashed line shows a fiducial detection limit (the same line is used in all panels for comparison), such that oscillations in stars above the line can not be detected (νmax ,detect &lt; 2.6 × 10 6 · 2 −Kp µHz). The distributions of the green symbols and black dots are shown as histograms in νmax and Kp.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sharma et al. 2016</ref>). However, due to the unknown selection function of the Kepler giants direct comparisons can not be made with what we see here for the K2 C1 sample. In the bottom histogram we also do not see any strong dependence on Kp for the difference between observed and predicted star counts, except perhaps a small tendency of relatively fewer observed stars fainter than Kp ∼ 13.5 − 14.0, mostly arising from the before-mentioned slight difference in observed and predicted bias around the sloping dashed line (faint low luminosity stars). Also in this histogram, we see that the star counts agree quite well for ν max &gt; 40 µHz (dotted curves) in agreement with the above discussion.</p><p>In summary, we see an expected (and largely predicted) detection bias for faint low luminosity red giant branch stars and an apparent, but still not fully understood, difference between observed and predicted star counts for red clump stars across all magnitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Comparison to EPIC classifications</head><p>Another source to investigate completeness are the stellar classifications provided in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog ( . While the EPIC uses Galaxia models for stellar parameter inference, the classifications are based on observational data such as reduced proper motions, colors, and spectroscopy, hence providing a more empirical test of the completeness of the seismic sample. Based on simulations and comparisons to the Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog ( <ref type="bibr">Huber et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mathur et al. 2016)</ref>, the dwarf/giant misclassification fraction in the EPIC is expected to be ∼ 5%.</p><p>Of the 1262 stars with a ν max value reported by at least one pipeline, all but one are classified in the EPIC. Of these, ∼ 9% are classified as dwarfs in the EPIC (log g &gt; 4) and ∼ 2% are classified as cool dwarfs (log g &gt; 4, T eff &lt; 4000 K). We expect that the hotter dwarfs (T eff &gt; 4000 K) are significantly affected by classification errors in the EPIC, and hence account for most of the 5% misclassification fraction mentioned above. Inspection of a 2MASS color-color diagram showed that at least half of the dwarfs with T eff &lt; 4000 K indeed have colors consistent with cool dwarfs. We therefore conclude that the fraction of seismic stars in our sample which are in fact dwarfs (with the seismic signal introduced e.g. by blended giants) is ∼ 2%.</p><p>Using the EPIC to estimate the number of missing seismic detections is more difficult, since the typical EPIC log g uncertainties on the RGB can be as high as 0.3 dex. Nevertheless, the fraction of C1 GAP targets which are classified with 3.2 &lt; log g &lt; 1.9 and ν max &lt; 2.6 × 10 6 · 2 −Kp in the EPIC is ∼ 14% (corresponding to ∼ 1200 stars), which is close to the observed fraction. This supports the conclusions based on the Galaxia models that the seismic sample is near complete.</p></div>
