			<abstract>
				<p>The Kepler mission has made an important observation, the first detection of photons from a terrestrial planet by observing its phase curve (Kepler-10b). This opens a new field in exoplanet science: the possibility to get information about the atmosphere and surface of rocky planets, objects of prime interest. In this letter, we apply the Lava-ocean model to interpret the observed phase curve. The model, a planet with no atmosphere and a surface partially made of molten rocks, has been proposed for planets of the class of CoRoT-7b, i.e. rocky planets very close to their star (at few stellar radii). Kepler-10b is a typical member of this family. It predicts that the light from the planet has an important emission component in addition to the reflected one, even in the Kepler spectral band. Assuming an isotropical reflection of light by the planetary surface (Lambertian-like approximation), we find that a Bond albedo of !50% can account for the observed amplitude of the phase curve, as opposed to a first attempt where an unusually high value was found. We propose a physical process to explain this still large value of the albedo. The overall interpretation can be tested in the future with instruments as JWST or EChO. Our model predicts a spectral dependence that is clearly distinguishable from that of purely reflected light, and from that of a planet at a uniform temperature.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Koch et al. 2010</ref>) has recently discovered a new super-Earth, Kepler10b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Batalha et al. 2011</ref>. It is a member of what looks as a new family, the CoRoT-7b-like planets or Lava-ocean planets (Léger, Rouan, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Schneider et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Léger et al. 2011</ref>, thereafter L+2011). Presently, this family contains two members,</p><p>CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b.</p><p>These planets share several key properties: (i) a radius less than 2 Earth radii, a mass less than 10 Earth masses; (ii) measured mass and radius pointing to a rocky composition;</p><p>(iii) a very short orbital period, and consequently a proximity to their parent star (P=0.85, and 0.84 day; a=0.0171, and 0.0168 AU; for CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, respectively).</p><p>Their central stars are solar-like.</p><p>The planet proximity to the central star likely induces a phase locking of spin and orbital rotations (locking time &lt;1 Myr). Consequently, the dayside continuously faces the star, and the nightside is in the dark, which produces a major asymmetry between them.</p><p>L+2011 proposed a physical model for such planets predicting several specific features, including a temperature map resulting only from a local equilibrium between the emitted radiation, and the received radiation (dayside) or geothermal flux (nightside). They derived high surface temperatures, 2500 and 3040 K at the respective sub-stellar points, which results in the fusion and vapor fractionation of rocks. This produces a lava-ocean made of refractory components extending over a significant fraction of the dayside (zenith angles "51° and "74°, respectively). The night side is very cold (50-75 K), setting the dichotomy between the bright and dark faces into numbers.</p><p>The extreme accuracy of the Kepler photometry has permitted the first direct detection of photons from a terrestrial planet, by observing changes in the system flux as a function of the planetary phase, and possibly detecting the secondary (back) transit (B+2011). It is remarkable that Kepler has succeeded in detecting this phase curve of a terrestrial exoplanet right at the beginning of the mission. The only phase curves detected so far were those of giant exoplanets <ref type="bibr">(Cowan &amp; Agol 2011</ref>) that produce a much larger signal 4 due to their size. This detection opens a new field because it is the only tool we will have in the near future to investigate atmospheres and surfaces of terrestrial planets.</p><p>B+2011 fitted the folded light curve of Kepler-10b with two parameters: the phase curve amplitude and the secondary transit amplitude. They found (!F/F)phase=7.6±2.0 ppm (1ppm!10 -6 ), and (!F/F)sec-trans=5.8±2.5 ppm. These values, with their uncertainties, are compatible with the expectation that the phase curve amplitude is smaller than, or equal to, the secondary transit amplitude when complete occultation occurs. In a first attempt, B+2011 proposed an interpretation in terms of purely reflected light but found an unusually high geometric albedo, p=0.68, corresponding to a Bond albedo A B =1.02±0.27 in the case of isotropical (Lambertian-like) reflection properties (p=(2/3)A B , Seager et al. 2000). They concluded that the emission of the planet had to be taken into account but did not estimate it.</p><p>Here, we reanalyze the same data but with a single parameter, and propose a physical and self-consistent interpretation, within the Lava-ocean model (L+2011). We propose a test of this interpretation, measurements in the near-IR where the emission dominates, using space instruments as JWST and/or EChO 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light components from Keper-10b</head><p>Immediately before and after a primary transit the radiation from a planet comes essentially from its nightside, and before and after the secondary transit from its dayside.</p><p>They have two components: (i) the planetary thermal emission, a function of the temperature and emissivity across the planet; (ii) the reflected starlight. In the following, we estimate the total amplitude of the planetary phase curve from extrapolations of the measured curve as if there were no transits.</p></div>

B+2011 were aware of the problem and considered their unusual high value as an indication that reflection alone failed explaining satisfactorily the observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible origin of the high albedo value</head><p>A !0.50 Bond albedo is still pretty high for an atmosphere-less planet, even if estimated with a large uncertainty. In particular, it is much larger than expected from pure Fresnel reflection (7.7% for Al 2 O 3 at normal incidence). This lava is almost as white as snow, and very different from that of terrestrial volcanoes. Is this realistic?</p><p>On Earth, white materials are usually made of inclusions of a non-absorbing material, with size similar to the light wavelength, within a non-absorbing matrix, e.g. water clouds, snow, white waters, white quartz, milks, white paints, paper... In this spirit, we propose two possible and complementary phenomena. Second, inhomogeneities within the lava can backscatter efficiently incident light. This situation is found in Earth's oceans (A B =6%, r sp =2%) with backscattering from colloidal suspensions, microbic algae, plankton" that also gives the different colors of seawater.</p><p>In the case of Lava-ocean planets, what could be the floating solid particles of nonabsorbing compound(s)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure_3</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>The candidate must melt above 3040 K, be insoluble in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO liquid, form small particles to efficiently scatter visible light, and be abundant enough. The most refractory oxides are: MgO (T fus =3105 K), CaO (3200 K), UO 2 (3140 K), and ThO 2 (3660 K) <ref type="bibr">(JANAF 1985</ref>). The first two are soluble in the melt, but the last two could be insoluble and precipitate ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mao et al. 2004</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Haggerty 1984)</ref>, an unit optical depth would be achieved for !10 cm of lava leading to a very efficient backscattering without major absorption, and then a high albedo.</p><p>We have no further indications that precipitate radii are in that range, but the above estimates indicate that ThO 2 particles, dispersed 2 in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO lava, can produce a 50% Bond albedo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible tests of the model</head><p>Discriminating tests of our interpretation of observations can be foreseen in the mid-future when suitable space instruments will be available. According to the mean value of the inferred Bond albedo, ~50%, the bolometric power emitted by the planet is similar to the reflected one. Within the Kepler spectral band, reflected light is larger than emitted light <ref type="figure">(Fig.3_left)</ref> because the planet is a cooler source ("3040 K) than the star (5600 K). This suggests a test using an instrument with a spectral response further in the IR, as JWST, or</p><p>EChO. <ref type="figure">Fig.3_middle</ref> shows the photon density of emitted and reflected light in near-IR, and the corresponding signals in different JWST spectral bands. The component that dominates the planetary light is predicted to change near 1 #m, when going from the visible to longer wavelengths. <ref type="figure">Fig.3_right</ref> shows the expected amplitude of the secondary transit signal in these bands.</p><p>The Lava-ocean model predicts a spectral variation significantly different from that of purely reflected light (constant amplitude, for a grey albedo), or from a planet whose temperature would be rendered uniform by a very thick atmosphere (T unif =2150 K, for A B =0.5), which could be tested. The JWST integration times needed to obtain the proposed accuracy (6' at 4.4 µm) are long (200 h per filter), but other strategies can be considered.</p><p>Analogous observations could be performed on 55Cnc-e (Winn et al 2011) in much shorter integration times, typically by two orders of magnitude given the intensity ratio of Kepler-10 and 55Cnc stars (V=6 and V=11, respectively). The use of the JWST spectrometers would avoid detector saturation. This planet is not studied in this letter because, according to the information available today, the Lava-ocean planet model does not apply to it.</p><p>However, such measurements would provide valuable clues on the physical processes occurring at the surface of that planet, whatever they are. They should be rather easy to obtain thanks to the high brightness of the stellar system, a real jewel that nature offers.</p><p>As Kepler keeps on observing, the S/N ratio of its measurements will improve (by a factor 5 1/2 ! 2.2 at the end of the five year mission, assuming no major improvement in the data reduction), and should better constrain the physical interpretations. In particular, it should be possible to reduce the uncertainty on the inferred albedo. Now, will it be possible to measure the phase curve amplitude and the secondary transit separately so that it can be decided whether they are equal, or not, and whether there is energy redistribution at the planetary surface?</p><p>In the Lava-ocean interpretation, secondary transit depth and phase curve amplitudes are equal. The emission part of the phase curve amplitude is 1.4 ppm, reflection part is 4.2 ppm <ref type="figure">(Fig.3-left)</ref>.</p><p>If the redistribution of energy was total, and the surface temperature uniform, the emission part of the phase curve would be null and the difference between the secondary transit and the phase curve amplitude would be the dayside emission. The bolometric value of the latter would be a quarter of the total for A B =0.5, occurring in the near-IR <ref type="figure">(Fig.3-right)</ref>.</p><p>In the Kepler band, this dayside emission can be overestimated by its value in the Lavaocean interpretation, 1.4 ppm, which should be compared to its expected uncertainty. The present value of the error on the secondary transit is 3.3 ppm (open circles in <ref type="figure">Fig.2)</ref>, and should reduce to 1.5 ppm at the end of the mission. The error on its difference with the phase curve will be the quadratic sum of that on the secondary transit, and that on the phase curve (2.0/2.2=0.9 ppm), or 1.8 ppm (1'). As this is larger than the quantity to be measured ("1.4 ppm), we conclude that Kepler will not be able to determine whether there is energy redistribution at the surface of the planet, unless a major improvement in the data reduction is achieved.</p><p>As stated, the situation would be different if instruments having spectroscopic capabilities and (very) high stability in the near-IR are built. For instance, observations with JWST should be able to discriminate between the different hypotheses, Lava-ocean model/pure reflection/total surface thermalisation, at the level of !6' for integration times of the order of 200 h per filter <ref type="figure">(Fig.3-right)</ref>, and may be even more efficient in pure spectroscopic modes.</p><p>In any case, the planetary phase observations by Kepler are steps towards the spectral study of terrestrial planets in the Habitable Zone of their star, objects of major interest. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure_2 9</head><label>9</label><figDesc>Figure_2</figDesc></figure>
