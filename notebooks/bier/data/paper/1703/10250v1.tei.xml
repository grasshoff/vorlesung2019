			<abstract>
				<p>We report the discovery of a repeating photometric signal from a low-mass member of the Praesepe open cluster that we interpret as a Neptune-sized transiting planet. The star is JS 183 (HSHJ 163, EPIC 211916756) with T eff = 3325±100 K, M * = 0.44±0.04 M , R * = 0.44±0.03 R , and log g * = 4.82 ± 0.06. The planet has an orbital period of 10.134588 days and a radius of R P = 0.32 ± 0.02 R J. Since the star is faint at V = 16.5 and J = 13.3, we are unable to obtain a measured radial-velocity orbit, but we can constrain the companion mass to below about 1.7 M J , and thus well below the planetary boundary. JS 183b (since designated as K2-95b) is the second transiting planet found with K2 that resides in a several hundred Myr open cluster; both planets orbit mid-M dwarf stars and are approximately Neptune-sized. With a well-determined stellar density from the planetary transit, and with an independently known metallicity from its cluster membership, JS 183 provides a particularly valuable test of stellar models at the fully convective boundary. We find that JS 183 is the lowest-density transit host known at the fully convective boundary, and that its very low density is consistent with current models of stars just above the fully convective boundary but in tension with the models just below the fully convective boundary.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction and Context</head><p>Open clusters have been one of the preferred locations for exoplanet searches since the early days of exoplanet discovery. Representing relatively compact, coeval populations of stars with similar composition, they serve as desirable testbeds for comparing planet frequencies and properties across various stellar parameters. They have been especially selected for transit searches, since many open clusters are compact on the sky, requiring few separate telescope pointings.</p><p>Early transit searches for planets in clusters failed to detect planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mochejska et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">von Braun et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burke et al. 2006</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mochejska et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mochejska et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pepper et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hartman et al. 2009</ref>). It appears that the primary reason for this is that such searches were sensitive only to hot Jupiters, which are intrinsically rare ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gould et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wright et al. 2012)</ref>, and that most open clusters do not have enough members for high probability detection of even one hot Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pepper &amp; Gaudi 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beatty &amp; Gaudi 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aigrain &amp; Pont 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">van Saders &amp; Gaudi 2011)</ref>. Radialvelocity (RV) searches suffer less from the low probability of fortuitous orbital inclination angles required for transit searches. Via an RV survey, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Quinn et al. (2012)</ref> discovered two Jupiter-mass planets in the open cluster Praesepe, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Malavolta et al. (2016)</ref> finding an additional much higher mass planet in one of these two systems, and <ref type="bibr">Quinn et al. (2014)</ref> reported a Jupiter-mass planet in the Hyades cluster. Three additional Jupiter-mass RV planets were reported in M67 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brucalassi et al. (2014)</ref>. Planets have also been found orbiting evolved members of open clusters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sato et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lovis &amp; Mayor 2007</ref>).</p><p>The higher frequency of smaller planets compared to hot Jupiters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Petigura et al. 2013</ref>) presents an opportunity to revisit open clusters as transit search targets. Missions like <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010</ref>) have the photometric precision to detect small planets, and the repurposed Kepler mission K2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Howell et al. 2014</ref>) covers a much larger fraction of the sky, allowing for multiple open clusters to be observed. The first transiting planets orbiting stars in clusters were claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Meibom et al. (2013)</ref>, who reported that two members of the ∼1-Gyr open cluster NGC 6811 in the Kepler field host sub-Neptune sized planet candidates associated with G-type main sequence stars. From K2 mission data, both  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">David et al. (2016b)</ref> reported the independent discovery of the Neptune-sized planet known as K2-25b orbiting the ∼600-800 Myr old Hyades cluster member Han87, with a late-M spectral type.</p><p>There are benefits to detecting planets in young (sub-Gyr) clusters. At early ages, the dynamical environments of the planetary systems might not be settled down. Planet-planet interactions might still be occurring at that stage. Once a statistically significant sample of extrasolar planets is found in clusters with various ages, we can explore the evolution of planetary systems at early times, with implications for planetary migration and dynamical stability. That process might also provide insight into the actual locations in the disk where the planets originally formed.</p><p>M dwarfs are of specific interest as transiting planet hosts, given the larger transit signal afforded by smaller stars. Also, it appears that M dwarfs are more likely than earlier-type stars to host planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2013)</ref>, with implications for the frequency of planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs <ref type="bibr">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>. According to the NASA Exoplanet Archive 1 , there are only 25 known M dwarfs (T eff ≤ 3850 K) with confirmed transiting planets. Since M dwarf properties are notoriously difficult to pin down (e.g., activity can inflate them, empirical relations for M dwarf radii suggest metallicity dependence, etc.; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Stassun et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mann et al. 2016b</ref>), this limits the precision on the transiting planet radii. Indeed, of the 25 previously known M dwarfs with transiting planets, only two <ref type="bibr">(GJ 1132</ref><ref type="bibr">, GJ 1214</ref> have measured parallaxes permitting a direct determination of the stellar radius and a spectroscopically determined metallicity to permit the most reliable stellar mass estimates from empirical relations, and because they are field stars, it is not possible to determine robust stellar ages. The expected arrival of parallaxes from the upcoming Gaia second data release promises to provide precise stellar and planetary parameters for many more transiting systems (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stassun et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>In this paper we report the discovery of a Neptune-sized planet transiting an M dwarf member of the Praesepe open cluster, observed by the K2 mission. The star is alternately referred to as JS 183 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Jones &amp; Stauffer 1991)</ref>, HSHJ 163 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hambly et al. 1995</ref>), 2MASS J08372705+1858360 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cutri et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>), and EPIC 211916756 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Huber et al. 2015</ref>). In the course of this work, this star was examined by other researchers and given the official K2 name K2-95b; however, since this star has been known as JS 183 in the literature for some time, we use the name JS 183 in this paper. Since the host star is a member of a well-studied stellar population with known distance, metallicity, and age, it is possible to obtain precise stellar and therefore planet properties and to assign a precise age to the system. Section 2 discusses the properties of the host star. Section 3 presents the archival and newly obtained photometric, spectroscopic, and imaging data that we use in this analysis. Section 4 presents the main results of this study, including a precise transit model, a detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis providing precise stellar properties, an analysis of RV observations placing an upper limit on the planet mass, and the final adopted planet properties, showing the planet to be a Neptune-sized planetary mass object transiting an M3.5-type cluster star. We summarize our findings and conclusions in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Praesepe Membership and Stellar Properties from the Literature</head><p>JS 183 is a modestly active M dwarf (spectral type ≈M3.5e; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2002)</ref>, high-probability member of the Praesepe cluster. In this section we briefly summarize the evidence for cluster membership and chromospheric activity, as well as salient general properties of the Praesepe cluster that therefore apply to JS 183. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the basic properties of JS 183, including a digest of the various identifiers with which it has appeared in the literature. The K2 name is EPIC 211916756. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Cluster Membership</head><p>A number of focused studies and all-sky surveys have determined cluster membership probabilities for JS 183 based on proper motion and/or RVs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref> included JS 183 in their focused propermotion study of the Praesepe cluster, finding a membership probability of 99.4%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Boudreault et al. (2012)</ref> similarly combined UKIDSS proper motions and photometry to obtain a cluster membership probability of 92%.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007)</ref>, respectively. In summary, there is strong consensus in the literature that JS 183 is a high-probability member of the Praesepe cluster based on its proper motion and photometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cluster Age and Metallicity</head><p>The accepted age of the Praesepe cluster is ≈600 Myr (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2002)</ref> although an older age of ≈800 Myr was recently advocated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Brandt &amp; Huang 2015)</ref>. Praesepe has been found to have a super-solar metallicity, with most values around [Fe/H] ≈ 0.1 (for a good summary see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Boesgaard et al. 2013</ref>) but with some values as high as [Fe/H] = 0.27 ± 0.10 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pace et al. 2008</ref>). In our analysis we make use of the metallicity to estimate the stellar radius expected from empirical M dwarf radius relations, and we use the cluster age to place the JS 183 planet system in the context of other systems of known age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Stellar Activity</head><p>Barrado y <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Navascués et al. (1998)</ref> conducted a comparison of Praesepe and Hyades chromospheric/coronal activity. Their reported data for JS 183 (identified as HSHJ 163) from a December 1997 Keck/HIRES observation indicated a Balmer line equivalent width EW(Hα) = 0.00Å00Å, and x-ray luminosity log L X &lt; 28.07 erg s −1 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2002)</ref> used low-resolution spectroscopy to obtain a spectral type of M3.5e, indicating activity, with EW(Hα) = −0.3 ˚ A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kafka &amp; Honeycutt (2006)</ref> also report an EW(Hα) = −0.16Å16Å. In summary, all of these studies show Hα just very weakly in emission or filled in, suggesting modest chromospheric activity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">K2 Observations and Light Curve Properties</head><p>The photometric observations from K2 require considerable attention to the construction of proper apertures and removal of systematic noise (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aigrain et al. (2016)</ref>). Here we describe the extraction of the light curve of JS 183, the removal of systematics, the identification of the transit signal, and the characterization of out-of-transit variability. a. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-K2 light curve of JS 183. From the top are the K2SC models of the pointing systematics (a), and of the stellar variability (b). Then the original PDC light curve (c), the systematics corrected version (d), and the fully detrended version -after removal of the stellar variability model (e). Version (d) was used in the transit search and modelling described in §4.1.1, while version (e) was used in the modelling described in §4.1.2. Note that there was a short gap in the original data at the time of the penultimate transit, which is why it appears to be missing. JS 183 was observed by K2 in its Campaign 5 field, from MJD 57139.13 to 57213.93, acquiring 3448 photometric observations at the standard 30-minute cadence. We downloaded the light curve file for JS 183 from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), which includes both Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) fluxes, and a version of the light curve after application of the Kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Twicken et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Stumpe et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Smith et al. 2012</ref>). This algorithm effectively models trends that are common to the ensemble of light curves, which was sufficient for the nominal Kepler mission but does not account for the diversity of pointing-related systematics present in K2 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref> and Van Cleve et al. (2016) for details). We therefore additionally used the K2SC Gaussian Process-based systematics correction algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aigrain et al. (2016)</ref> to detrend both SAP and PDC light curves with respect to pointing variations. This algorithm models the stellar variability simultaneously with the pointing-dependent systematics, and outputs a model for each component, so that either or both can be subtracted at will.</p><p>While the PDC light curve is usually the version of choice to look for transit signals, the PDC pipeline sometimes removes true astrophysical signals on timescales &gt; 20 d. Therefore, it is usually considered advisable to use the SAP light curve as a starting point for any detailed analysis of the transits and outof-transit variability. However, after a visual comparison of the SAP and PDC light curves (both before and after modelling with K2SC), we opted to work with the PDC light curve throughout this paper. This decision was made because the SAP light curve is affected by long-term trends which are probably systematic, and because the K2SC modelling of the (shorter timescale) pointing-related systematics is less successful in the SAP than in the PDC light curve for this particular object. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the K2 PDC light curve for JS 183 along with the variability and systematics models from K2SC, as well as the light curve after correcting systematics only, and after also removing the variability model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the individual transits in more detail, using the detrended version of the light curve shown as version (e) in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

The first was visual inspection of the SAP and PDC light curves for all likely members of Praesepe observed by K2 (the transits are clearly visible in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). The second was a systematic search for transits, which we performed for all the K2SC-detrended PDC light curves for Campaign 5 (after subtraction of both systematics and variability models), in which JS 183 was identified. The details of this search are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pope et al. (2016)</ref>, who also report the full list of transit candidates. The initial search found transits with a period of ∼ 10.1 d, a depth of ∼ 7 parts per thousand, and a duration of ∼ 3 h, consistent with a transiting companion somewhat smaller than Jupiter.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Out-of-transit variability and rotation</head><p>The light curve displays smooth, quasi-periodic variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude ∼ 2%, which we attribute to rotational modulation due to star spots. The K2SC pipeline detected these variations and automatically switched to using a quasi-periodic GP covariance function to model them. This covariance function is parametrized by a period, an amplitude, a periodic length scale (which controls the number of inflexions per period) and an evolutionary timescale. The best-fit values of the period and evolutionary timescale parameters were 25.5 d and ∼ 200 d, respectively. The former can be interpreted as an estimate of the host star's rotation period, while the latter suggests that the characteristic lifetime of the active regions present on the star's surface at the time of the observations was roughly 8 times the rotation period. Recent studies of rotation in Praesepe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Delorme et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agüeros et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Douglas et al. 2014)</ref> show a tight relationship between period and color from J − K ∼ 0.25 to J − K ∼ 0.8, with periods tightly clustered around values ranging from ∼ 6 d at the bluer end to ∼ 10 d at the redder end. Redwards of J − K ∼ 0.8, however, the rotation period distribution becomes extremely broad, with periods ranging from 0.2 to &gt; 30 d irrespective of color. With J − K = 0.84, JS 183 lies in this second regime, and a rotation period of ∼ 25 d is thus consistent with, albeit at the longer end of, the expected range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Follow-up Light Curve Observations</head><p>In order to confirm the properties of the transit, we observed JS 183 on the night of UT 2016 February 26, using a thinned, back-side illuminated Tektronix 2048 CCD ("new2K") on the USNO, Flagstaff Station 40-inch telescope. A standard Kron-Cousins I-band filter was used with an exposure time of 120 sec (based on test exposures the previous night) and readout overhead of 51 sec, resulting in a net observing cadence of 171 sec. A total of 160 frames of JS 183 were obtained between UT 02:17 and UT 09:51. The frames were processed in real time with bias and flat-field frames obtained at the beginning of the night. Sky conditions were clear, although the seeing gradually worsened from about 1.2 arcsec FWHM at the beginning of the night to about 2.2 arcsec at the end of the exposure series.</p><p>As a result of these observations, we obtain a clear detection of the transit, albeit at a lower photometric precision than from K2. The detection took place about 221 days after the last of the K2 observations, an offset of 22 orbital periods. The USNO light curve is shown in conjunction with the K2 light curve in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. In §4.1 we show that incorporating the USNO light curve into the analysis gives a consistent solution with modelling the K2 light curve alone.</p></div>

The 1997 observation used a wavelength range of 6300Å6300Å to 8725Å8725Å, while the 2015 and 2016 observations used a range of 4800Å4800Å to 9200Å9200Å, except for the final one. The images were processed and spectra extracted and calibrated using the makee software 2 written by Tom Barlow. The spectral type estimate for the star from these high-dispersion data is M3-M4. We infer the presence of a small amount of stellar chromospheric activity based on the fact that the Hα line is completely filled in, with no apparent absorption or emission and thus no equivalent width measurement is possible. The Hβ line is weakly in emission with EW (Hβ) = −0.45Å45Å.</p><p>From these spectra we obtained single-lined radial velocities of the host star. Heliocentric velocities were measured in the four Keck/HIRES spectra by cross-correlating with radial velocity standards obtained at the same time as the program spectra. The mean and standard deviations of the multi-order radial velocities are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1.">Primary Analysis: Gaussian Process Transit Model</head><p>The K2 light curve of JS 183 is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and displays evolving starspot modulation with an amplitude of ∼2% and period ∼24 days. To account for the effect of this stellar variability across each transit, we simultaneously model the out-of-transit variations at the same time as fitting for the transit parameters. We therefore model the full light curve as the sum of a Gaussian process plus transit model (hereafter GP-transit model). The transit component is based on the model presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Irwin et al. (2011)</ref>, which is a modified version of the (JKT)EBOP family of models, but which uses the analytic method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> for the quadratic limb darkening law. The Gaussian process (GP) component, which is used to describe the out-of-transit variability, is based on the george package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ambikasaran et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Foreman-Mackey et al. 2014</ref>). For the K2 light curve, the GP component is a quasi-periodic exponentialsine-squared kernel, which is essentially a periodic kernel that is allowed to evolve over time, i.e. mimicking evolving starspot modulation.</p><p>In addition to the K2 discovery light curve we use the USNO light curve described in §3.2. The singlenight observation is not long enough to clearly see the evolving starspot modulation displayed in the K2 light curve. Instead, the dominant variations display a relatively rough behavior over short (1 hour) timescales. Accordingly, we opt for a Matern-3/2 kernel in our GP model, as its covariance properties are more suited to the observed behavior.</p><p>We simultaneously modeled the K2 and USNO light curves using our GP-transit model, with the parameter space explored through the Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, as implemented in emcee (Foreman- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). This model will be presented in detail in <ref type="bibr">Gillen et al. (in prep)</ref>. We ran the MCMC for 50 000 steps with each of 144 'walkers' and derived parameter distributions from the last 25 000 steps of each chain (after thinning each chain from inspection of the autocorrelation lengths for each parameter). In addition, the K2 model was supersampled to 1 min cadence.</p><p>Since we do not have strong prior information about the eccentricity of this orbit, we opted to apply four different models to this system. These models are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> and differ only in their eccentricity, effective temperature and surface gravity priors, the latter two giving different priors on the stellar density: A) an eccentric orbit with a stellar density prior from the empirical relations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mann et al. (2016b)</ref> (see §4.2), B) an eccentric orbit with a stellar density prior from the SED fitting (again see §4.2), C) an eccentric orbit with an uninformative stellar density prior, and D) a circular orbit with an uninformative stellar density prior. Model A is our main model. We then test this stellar density prior first by relaxing it slightly in model B and then relaxing it fully with an uninformative prior in model C. Finally, in model D, we keep the uninformative stellar density prior but force the orbit to circular to investigate the effect of eccentricity.</p><p>The effective temperature and surface gravity priors in models A and B naturally give rise to priors on the limb darkening coefficients. These were computed using the LDTK toolkit (Parviainen 2015), which allows us to propagate the uncertainties in these stellar parameters (and the metallicity Z = 0.1±0.1) through the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Husser et al. 2013</ref>) into our coefficients. The uncertainties on the limb darkening coefficients were then inflated by a factor of 50 to account for differences between model grids. In the light curve modelling, the limb darkening parameterisation follows the triangular sampling method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kipping (2013)</ref> (see that paper for the relationship between the 'q' parameters plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig  6</ref> and standard quadratic limb darkening coefficients.) Uninformative priors were used on all other transit parameters.</p><p>Using models A-D we can explore the information content of the data, how our priors effect our results, and the confidence with which we can characterise this system.

As we believe the empirically-determined stellar density constraint to be well-founded, we opt to use model A (eccentric orbit with a stellar density constraint from empirical relations) as the main model discussed here, but also present results from the other three for comparison and to investigate the effect of our assumptions. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the full K2 and USNO light curves along with the GP-transit model A. The model is an acceptable fit the the large scale structure of both light curves. In the K2 case, the GP model predicts a stellar rotation period of 23.8 days and is able to reproduce the evolving shape of the modulation. For the USNO light curve, the GP favors a smooth model for the out-of-transit variations due to the observational uncertainties, even though apparent correlations can be seen in the residuals. The significance of these variations (as well as lower level ones present in the K2 light curve) are investigated at the end of this section. The top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the model A transit fits to both the K2 and USNO light curves (left and right, respectively). In the K2 panel, the effect of the orbital period being close to an integer multiple of the cadence can be seen. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> presents the parameters of model A (leftmost results column) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> presents the 2D contours and 1D histograms of the transit parameter MCMC chains from which the posteriors reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> are derived. There are significant correlations between the parameters of interest, as expected given we only have photometric data of the transit (i.e. no secondary eclipse or radial velocities). Allowing an eccentric orbit drives most of the observed correlations: fixing the orbit to circular removes the correlations of interest, bar those between the cosine of the inclination (cos i) and the radius sum ((R p + R * )/a). The correlations arise from the fact that small changes in a given parameter can be effectively masked by corresponding changes in one or more others without significant modification to the transit shape.   We now compare the four different models to investigate the effect of our assumptions about the eccentricity and stellar density. The four rows of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> show (in descending order) the fits of models A, B, C and D. All models are able to reproduce the observed transit shapes within the observational uncertainties, even though they have different shapes and durations. These transit models are integrated to the K2 cadence. To highlight the effect of this observational cadence on the depicted transit models, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the unintegrated transit of Model A (red line and shaded regions) and the integrated model predictions for the times of observation (blue points). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> presents the posterior parameter distributions of the four GP-transit models. As expected, the period and ephemeris are essentially insensitive to the choice of model and underlying assumptions. As previously mentioned, the limb darkening coefficients of models A and B are theoretically constrained given the assumed stellar temperature, surface gravity and cluster metallicity, whereas they are unconstrained in models C and D; the differences can be seen in the limb darkening panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>. In the distributions for the radius sum ((R p + R * )/a), radius ratio (R p /R * ), inclination (i), and the combination terms √ e cos ω and √ e sin ω, we see the effect of our assumptions about the eccentricity and stellar density. First, the stellar density: this essentially places a prior on the transit duration, which in turn constrains the radius ratio, radius sum and √ e sin ω (and to lesser extents √ e cos ω and the orbital period, P ). Most importantly, model A (black), which places a tight constraint on the stellar density, constrains the transit duration such that the model favors a single-peaked radius ratio distribution around R p /R * ∼ 0.075 − 0.08. Relaxing the constraint on the stellar density (models B and C, orange and blue, respectively) allows the model to explore an additional family of solutions comprising a larger planet-to-star radius ratio (and correspondingly these models explore a larger range of inclinations, radius sums and eccentricities to remain consistent with the observed fluxes). The effect of eccentricity can be investigated by comparing models C and D (blue and green, respectively). Forcing the orbit to be circular has a similar effect to placing a tight constraint on the stellar density: model D favors a single-peaked radius ratio distribution and has tighter posterior distributions for the radius sum and inclination than models B and C.</p><p>The GP hyperparameters are mainly insensitive to the chosen model. For the K2 light curve, the amplitude (A K2 ), period (P ESS K2 ) and white noise term (σ K2 ) are well-constrained by the data but the scale factor (Γ ESS K2 ) and evolutionary timescale (l SE K2 ) have Gaussian priors that essentially define their posterior distributions. The evolutionary timescale is related to the half-life of the active regions that are responsible for the observed modulation pattern; however, the exact nature of this relationship is not firmly established. It is worth noting that data covering two evolutionary periods is needed to robustly constrain this parameter, so it is not surprising that it is not well constrained in this case. However, while the evolutionary timescale and scale factor affect the other GP hyperparameters, they do not affect the final transit parameters significantly. For the USNO light curve, the GP amplitude (A USNO ) and timescale (l USNO ) hyperparameters are not well-determined; the differences in the timescale posteriors arise from the tightness of the different transit model fits, and are therefore driven by the stellar density and eccentricity constraints.</p><p>Investigating the residual variations in the K2 and USNO light curves K2 : The model presented above for the K2 light curve seeks to explain the large-scale structure. While it is an acceptable fit to the data, zooming in on small sections of the light curve reveals small-amplitude, shorttimescale variations, which could arise from low-level stellar variations or residual systematics. Arguably, adding another GP into the model might account for these but there would be a lot of flexibility in such a composite GP model, and it is not clear that the residual variations are significant throughout the majority of the light curve. Therefore, to test the significance of these residual variations, we first detrended the light curve with respect to the smoothly varying starspot modulations, and then modelled the residual light curve using a Matern-3/2 kernel in our GP-transit model (as previously discussed, this kernel displays a relatively rough behavior, which is suited to the observed residual systematics). It appears as though the information content of the residual light curve is not sufficient to support the additional treatment of the Matern-3/2 kernel. The GP model favors a very small amplitude and either a long timescale over which to vary, or a very short one, depending on the initial guess for the input scale. Neither of these are suited to the observed residuals, which have timescales of a few hours, and which are at times clearly observed above the noise. We therefore did not use a more sophisticated GP kernel for the K2 light curve.</p><p>USNO: The residuals of the USNO model are clearly seen in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The mean GP model smoothly varies over a relatively long timescale, in contrast to parts of the light curve that show variations over 1 hour timescales. To assess the significance of these variations we re-ran our model and used the GP itself to estimate the full observational uncertainties (rather than simply allowing it to inflate the uncertainties if required). This second model converges on the same variability and transit parameter values as presented above, which suggests that the information content of the light curve is not sufficient to warrant smaller uncertainties; accordingly, we did not investigate the observed variations further.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that the validity of the observational uncertainties, and hence the analysis above, are subject to the choice of model. Here, the GP model attempts to find the simplest way of explaining the data, given our choice of covariance kernel, and in doing so may opt to increase the uncertainties on each data point rather than the complexity of the chosen family of models if the dataset as a whole is unable to support the additional complexity. Accordingly, in model A (presented in §4.1.1), the GP opted to slightly inflate the uncertainties by factors of ∼1.37 and 1.17 for the K2 and USNO light curves, respectively (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>).</p></div>

This analysis uses the K2SC-detrended PDC-MAP light curve and simplifies the approach by assuming white noise. The transits are modelled using PyTransit (Parviainen 2015) with a quadratic Mandel-Agol model, and emcee is used for posterior sampling, as in the main analysis ( §4.1.1). The files associated with this analysis can be found from <ref type="bibr">GitHub. 3</ref> This analysis consider four cases for orbital eccentricity, stellar density, and log g (assuming a stellar radius of 0.43 R ), listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. The sampling space is ten-dimensional, comprised of the zero epoch, orbital period, planet-star area ratio, impact parameter, stellar density, √ e cos ω, √ e sin ω, two quadratic limb darkening parameters, and average white noise level. All the parameters except the eccentricity and log g have uninformative priors, and the limb darkening uses the parametrization described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kipping (2013)</ref>.</p><p>The posterior sampling starts by creating a parameter vector population of 100 walkers distributed uniformly inside the prior boundaries. We clump the population close to the global posterior maximum using the Differential Evolution global optimization algorithm implemented in PyDE 4 (Parviainen 2016), and initialize the MCMC sampler with the clumped parameter vector population. The sampler is run over 15000 iterations, and then samples from every 100th iteration, after a burn-in set of 2000 iterations is selected to represent the posterior distribution. The thinning factor of 100 iterations was chosen by inspecting the autocorrelation lengths for individual parameters.</p><p>The results from the sanity check analyses are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>, and they agree with the primary analysis. One small difference between the two analyses is that the main analysis finds a broader and near-bimodal distribution for the planet/star radius ratio. We believe that is because the main analysis uses GPs, whereas the the analysis in this section assumes white noise. When using GPs, the transit shape does not constrain the parameter space as strongly, and that additional freedom allows for a larger variety of possible solutions. In the end, we do not believe that this difference represents a challenge to our final system parameters.

The reported uncertainties on the SDSS griz photometry are very small (∼0.005 mag), so we rounded up these photometric uncertainties to 0.05 mag to account for photometric variability due to modest activity in this source as well as zero-point uncertainties of ≈0.02 mag in the SDSS photometry. The free parameters of the fit are T eff , log g, [Fe/H], and A V ; for the latter we adopted a maximum possible value of 0.085 mag based on the full line-of-sight extinction from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref> dust maps. We interpolate the model grid by 10 K T eff , from the native gridding of 100 K.

This is equivalent to inflating the measurement errors by a constant factor, and has the effect of increasing the parameter uncertainties accordingly. The T eff from our SED fit is consistent with the previously reported M3.5 spectral type ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2002)</ref> to within ∼0.5 spectral subtype.</p><p>We can use the fitted SED models to compute a bolometric flux at Earth, again according to the ∆χ 2 criterion above. This gives F bol = 2.10±0.09 ×10 −11 erg s −1 cm −2 . Note that this F bol and its uncertainty are robust because the model fit is essentially an interpolation of the observed fluxes that span the majority of the SED. This F bol together with the nominal cluster distance of 182±6 pc (van Leeuwen 2009) and the best-fit T eff then permits a calculation of the stellar radius via the Stefan-Boltzmann relation, giving R = 0.44 ± 0.03 R . The radius uncertainty includes the uncertainties on the bolometric flux, the parallax distance, and T eff , in quadrature. This is somewhat larger than the radius predicted from the empirical T eff -R relation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mann et al. (2016b)</ref>, which gives R = 0.31 ± 0.04 R .

This mass together with the radius from above then gives a stellar surface gravity of log g = 4.82 ± 0.06.</p><p>The ratio of the planet radius to the stellar radius is found to be 0.08, and with the measured stellar radius of 0.44 R , that yields a planet radius of 0.32 ± 0.02 R J . We can also calculate an estimated equilibrium temperature for the planet based on the ratio of the stellar radius to planet semimajor axis, stellar temperature, taking the orbit to be circular, and assuming a Bond albedo of 0.3 (similar to Neptune). With those assumptions, we find T eq = 480 ± 23 K. The full list of derived and calculated planet properties is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 7</ref>.</p><p>We have performed an analysis of our radial-velocity measurements in order to estimate an upper limit for the mass of the transiting planet. We have six RV measurements, and the standard deviation of these measurements is 1.08 km s −1 , which corresponds to a maximum mass for the planet of 6.7 M Jup (assuming a zero eccentricity). However, in order to take the shape of the radial velocity model into account, we have tested a circular-orbit model with seven free parameters, namely the systemic radial velocity (uniform prior between 30-40 km s −1 ), orbital period, time of mid-transit and inclination (all three with Gaussian priors based on the light curve analysis), stellar mass (Gaussian prior according to the above estimation), and planet mass (with a uniform prior between 0 and 30 Jupiter masses). We have also included radial velocity jitter (with uniform prior between 0 and 5 km s −1 ) to account for possible additional sources of white noise. We used the emcee code <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>) to explore the posterior distribution of the planetary mass based on the current data. We used 50 walkers and 5000 steps per walker. We then used a simple burn-in of half of the chains and merge all of them to get the final posterior distribution. This method is similar to that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Grunblatt et al. (2016)</ref>. The result of this analysis yields no detection of the planet (as expected from the radial velocity uncertainties). However, it allows us to set an upper limit for the mass of the transiting object of 0.83 M Jup at 99.7% confidence given the current data (assuming e = 0). The results of these tests are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>. Note that in this RV phase plot, the maximum expected RV displacement based on the transit model would occur at a phase of 0.75, opposite the offset of the RV observation at that phase, which therefore strongly constrains the allowable mass of the companion.</p><p>The planet orbiting JS 183 can therefore not yet be confirmed through radial velocity detection of the stellar reflex motion. For a planet with a radius of about 0.32 R J , we would expect a mass of roughly 15 R ⊕ (see <ref type="bibr">Chen &amp; Kipping (e.g. 2016)</ref>). For a host star with M * = 0.44 ± 0.04 M , and a circular orbit with a period of 10.134588 days, we would expect an RV semiamplitude of about 0.008 km s −1 , far below the ≈ 0.3 km s −1 errors of our HIRES RV observations <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>. Although the object would be detectable using current state-of-the-art precision radial velocity techniques having 1-2 m s −1 errors (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Plavchan et al. 2015</ref>), the star is too faint in practice for these methods to be applied. In such cases, validation of the planet interpretation is typically undertaken either empirically or statistically. Empirical methods use a suite of observations that may be sensitive to detection of certain kinds of blend scenarios (e.g. O' <ref type="bibr">Donovan et al. 2006</ref>) that could mimic the observed transit signal. Statistical methods can estimate the probability of to the median of the marginalized posterior probabilities. With large errors compared to the expected RV amplitude, we do not detect the associated dynamical signal of the planet. Note that the transit observations predict negative RV variation at phase of 0.25, and positive RV variation at phase of 0.75. We are able to place a limit of 0.83 M Jup at 99.7% confidence as the upper limit for any planet on the system, still well above the expected mass of the transiting planet detected by K2.</p><p>various contaminating eclipsing binary scenarios given the source location on the sky relative to the modelled galactic field star population, and assumptions regarding the mass function, binary fraction, and binary mass ratios (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Morton 2014</ref>).</p><p>As we were writing this paper, we became aware of work by <ref type="bibr">Obermeier et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mann et al. (2017)</ref>, who independently discovered and followed up the same K2 time series data on EPIC 211916756. The thorough false-positive analysis presented in the <ref type="bibr">Obermeier et al. (2016)</ref> paper need not be repeated here. From empirical considerations, no companions are detected in high spatial resolution imaging or in spectroscopy. From statistical considerations, a false positive probability calculation rules out line-ofsight blended and bound hierarchical eclipsing binary systems. Remaining for consideration is the planet hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>For low-mass stars, metallicity substantially affects the radius of the star (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mann et al. 2016b</ref>). Since the planet radius as obtained from the transit depends directly on the stellar radius, its precision is limited by the precision of the stellar radius, and hence metallicity. In general, cluster stars such as JS 183 have better constrained metallicities than field stars, given the ability to study a large population that is presumed to be chemically homogeneous.</p><p>To date, there are more than 2500 unique hosts to confirmed exoplanets, but only 100 with effective temperatures ≤4000 K. Of these, only 16 have reliable mean stellar densities determined either from transit fitting or detailed stellar characterization and reported in the NASA Exoplanet Archive 5 . We examine this complete sample of late-type hosts to confirmed transiting exoplanets in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. The figure shows that the higher metallicity of JS 183 leads to a larger radius and thus smaller stellar density than other transiting planet hosts of comparable temperature. For low-mass stars, which evolve slowly relative to higher masses, the mean stellar density is largely an indicator of metallicity and is relatively insensitive to age. Typically, as in this work, a stellar density determined from some combination of empirical relations and models is used as a prior in exoplanet transit fitting, due to the covariances between stellar density, e, and ω. However, if the 5 http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/  <ref type="figure">Fig. 11</ref>.-Left: Late-type exoplanet host stars with well-determined stellar densities from transit fitting (filled markers) or through some combination of spectroscopy, models, and empirical relations (x's). Underplotted are PARSEC v1.2S isochrones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bressan et al. 2012</ref>) in the effective temperature-mean stellar density plane. Solid and dashed curves represent 600 Myr and 1 Gyr isochrones, respectively. Curve colors correspond to different metallicities. The solar metallicity isochrone reproduces well the majority of transiting planet host stars cooler than 4000 K. At these cool temperatures, the mean stellar density is largely an indicator of metallicity and is relatively insensitive to age. The parameters for GJ 1214 are adopted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Anglada-Escudé et al. (2013)</ref>. Preliminary transit fitting results of GJ 1132 suggest a lower stellar density than the value from empirical relations, which is plotted here (Berta-Thompson, private comm.). The planet host K2-33 is a pre-main sequence star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">David et al. 2016a;</ref>) and thus substantially less dense than the field population. Right: an enhanced view of the figure at left in the region around JS 183, only with those exoplanet hosts with densities constrained by transit fits. Three determinations for the parameters of JS 183 are indicated by the filled black circle (this work), open square ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mann et al. 2017)</ref>, and open triangle ( <ref type="bibr">Obermeier et al. 2016</ref>). Notably, a super-solar metallicity isochrone best matches the parameters of JS 183, consistent with the enhanced metallicity of the Praesepe cluster. Exoplanet host star data were culled from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, but mean stellar densities were taken from the transit fitting results of the primary references listed in the Exoplanet Archive, wherever reported.</p><p>orbital elements of an exoplanet are well constrained, the stellar density inferred from a transit light curve can be a powerful diagnostic of metallicity and test of stellar models at low masses; the technique of using exoplanet transits to determine precise stellar densities is sometimes called asterodensity profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kipping 2014</ref>).</p><p>Late-type transiting exoplanet hosts with temperatures higher than 3400 K are in general agreement with a field age, solar-metallicity isochrone, using the PARSEC v1.2s models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bressan et al. 2012</ref>). However, the majority of transiting exoplanet hosts with temperatures below 3400 K possess transit-derived stellar densities that are too large to be reproduced by the solar metallicity models. While transit-derived stellar densities are often poorly constrained due to the unknown orbital elements, transit fits tend to drive stellar density to lower values due to the aformentioned covariances and a bias favoring high impact parameters or grazing transits <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kipping &amp; Sandford 2016)</ref>. There are hints of this bias apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 8</ref>. Thus, e and ω may not be the only culprits explaining the larger dispersion in stellar densities for the coolest exoplanet hosts. It is possible that 1) stellar models may underpredict the densities of the coolest stars, or 2) some of the the cool transiting exoplanet hosts have significantly sub-solar metallicities. We presume the latter explanation is unlikely, especially given the fact that the well-studied planet host GJ 1214 has a super-solar metallicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Rojas-Ayala et al. 2012</ref>).</p><p>In comparison with other well-studied exoplanet hosts with a similar effective temperature, JS 183 has the lowest mean stellar density to date 6 . The star's low density is consistent with expectations of an inflated radius due to the Praesepe cluster's super-solar metallicity. The fact that JS 183's spectral type of M3.5 right near the stellar fully convective boundary provides the intriguing suggestion that the models are performing well at masses/temperatures just above that boundary but performing poorly below that boundary, where the onset of full convection leads to additional challenges for low-mass stellar modeling.</p><p>The recent discoveries of short-period (&lt; 10s days) Neptune-sized planets around young low-mass stars reveal planet radii significantly larger than the planets observed around field M dwarfs <ref type="bibr">(Dressing &amp; Char- bonneau 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, 2015</ref>, even after accounting for the trend of planet inflation with insolation. One possibility is that the young planets have not finished contracting, and will eventually settle into the population of short-period super-Earths, a region of higher occurrence, as determined from Kepler statistics of field stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>We have reported here the discovery of a Neptune-size planet transiting an M dwarf member of the Praesepe open cluster, also discussed by <ref type="bibr">(Obermeier et al. 2016</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mann et al. (2017)</ref>. Although we do not have a dynamical mass of the companion, we can constrain its mass to be planetary. This discovery adds to the small list of exoplanets found in open clusters, and planetary companions of M dwarfs. The well-known age and metallicity of the Praesepe cluster give reliable values for those properties of the planet, which can be valuable for consideration of theoretical models of planet formation and evolution.</p><p>This system also features the best-determined radius for an M dwarf planet host, and is only the third M dwarf planet host for which a reliable age is known via cluster membership. Indeed, with the lowest stellar density known among transiting planet hosts near the stellar fully convective boundary, JS 183 suggests that current stellar models are able to reproduce well its properties as arising from its super-solar metallicity, and</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>JS 183 has also been included in all-sky proper-motion surveys, with the following proper motions (µ α , µ δ ) [mas yr −1 ] from USNO B1, PPMX, and URAT, respectively: (−34, −14), (−39, −17), (−34, −17).
