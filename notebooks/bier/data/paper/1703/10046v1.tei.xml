				<p>This paper considers whether the population of known transiting exoplanets provides evidence for additional outer planets on inclined orbits, due to the perturbing effect of such planets on the orbits of inner planets. As such, we develop a semi-analytical method for calculating the probability that two mutually inclined planets are observed to transit. We subsequently derive a simplified analytical form to describe how the mutual inclination between two planets evolves due to secular interactions with a wide orbit inclined planet and use this to determine the mean probability that the two inner planets are observed to transit. From application to Kepler-48 and HD-106315 we constrain the inclinations of the outer planets in these systems (known from RV). We also apply this work to the so called Kepler Dichotomy, which describes the excess of single transiting systems observed by Kepler. We find 3 different ways of explaining this dichotomy: some systems could be inherently single, some multi-planet systems could have inherently large mutual inclinations, while some multi-planet systems could cyclically attain large mutual inclinations through interaction with an inclined outer planet. We show how the different mechanisms can be combined to fit the observed populations of Kepler systems with one and two transiting planets. We also show how the distribution of mutual inclinations of transiting two planet systems constrains the fraction of two planet systems that have perturbing outer planets, since such systems should be preferentially discovered by Kepler when the inner planets are coplanar due to an increased transit probability.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over the past 20 years the number of exoplanet detections has soared most notably due to contributions from the Kepler space telescope (Kepler herein). As of November 2016 Kepler has detected 3414 confirmed planets, with 575 existing in multi-planet systems (exoplanet.eu; <ref type="bibr">Schnei- der et al. (2011)</ref>). Planet multiplicity provides information on the underlying architecture of planetary systems, such as expected orbital spacing, mutual inclinations and size distributions. For the multi-planet systems observed by Kepler, super Earth/mini Neptune type objects on tightly packed orbits inside of ∼200 days are common ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lissauer et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Morton et al. (2016)</ref>). Moreover such systems are observed to have small inclination dispersions of 5 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fang &amp; Margot (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Figueira et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tremaine &amp; Dong (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marmier et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fabrycky et al. (2014)</ref>).</p><p>E-mail: mjr201@ast.cam.ac.uk How representative Kepler multi-planet systems are of a common underlying planetary architecture however is impeded by Kepler preferentially detecting objects which orbit closest to the host star. To generalise Kepler systems to an underlying population, it is therefore necessary to account for the inherent probability that transiting systems are observed. Taking into account such probabilities, there appears to be an over-abundance of planetary systems with a single transiting planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al. (2011)</ref>; Youdin (2011); <ref type="bibr">Jo- hansen et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ballard &amp; Johnson (2016)</ref>). This is commonly referred to as the 'Kepler Dichotomy'.</p><p>It is currently not known what causes this excess. Statistical and Spitzer confirmation studies all suggest that the false positive rate for single transiting objects with R p &lt;4R ⊕ is low at 15% <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Morton &amp; Johnson (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Fressin et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coughlin et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2015)</ref>). Perhaps then, there are populations of inherently single planet systems in addition to multi-planet systems which are closely packed and have small inclination dispersions. However there may also be a population of multi-planet systems where the mutual inclination dispersion is large, such that only a single planet is observed to transit.</p><p>The presence of an outer planetary companion may drive this potential large spread in mutual inclinations. Recent N-body simulations show that the presence of a wide orbit planet in multi-planet systems can decrease the number of inner planets that are observed to transit, either through dynamical instability or inclination excitation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mustill et al. (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hansen (2017)</ref>). Beyond a few au, planetary transit probabilities drop to negligible values. It is possible therefore that additional wide orbit planets could indeed exist in multi-planet systems observed by Kepler. Giant planets at a few au have been detected around stars in the general stellar population by a number of radial velocity (RV) surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marmier et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rowan et al. (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Wit- tenmyer et al. (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bryan et al. (2016)</ref>), with suggested occurrence rates ranging from ∼ 10 − 50% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cumming et al. (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bryan et al. (2016)</ref>). Moreover, indirect evidence of undetected giant planets has also been suggested through apsidal alignment of inner RV detected planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dawson &amp; Chiang (2014)</ref>). As RV studies are largely insensitive to planetary inclinations, it is possible that such wide orbit planets could be on mutually inclined orbits, which may arise from a warp in the disc <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fragner &amp; Nelson (2010)</ref>) or due to an excitation by a stellar flyby ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zakamska &amp; Tremaine (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Malmberg et al. (2011)</ref>).</p><p>Calculating transit probabilities of multi-planet systems is complex, often requiring computationally exhaustive numerical methods such as Monte Carlo techniques (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Lis- sauer et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johansen et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker &amp; Adams (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mustill et al. (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hansen (2017)</ref>). However analytical methods can offer a significantly more efficient route for this calculation and allows for coupling with other fundamental analytical theory, such as for the expected dynamical evolution of the system from inter-planet interactions. Despite this however, analytical investigations into the transit probabilities of multi-planet systems for this purpose are relatively sparse (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ragozzine &amp; Holman (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Braken- siek &amp; Ragozzine (2016)</ref>). Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brakensiek &amp; Ragozzine (2016)</ref> showed how differential geometry techniques can be used to calculate multi-planet transit probabilities by mapping transits onto a celestial sphere. In this paper we perform a similar analysis, however we focus on regions where pairs of planets can be observed to transit. We also give an explicit analytical form using simple vector relations to describe the boundaries of such transit regions.</p><p>The multi-planet systems observed by Kepler appear to be mostly stable on long timescales ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pu &amp; Wu (2015)</ref>). Dynamical interactions with a potential outer planet on an inclined orbit would therefore be expected to occur on secular timescales. Recent analytical work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lai &amp; Pu (2017)</ref> suggests that such interactions can lead to large mutual inclinations in an inner planetary system, assuming that the direction of the angular momentum vector of the outer planet is fixed. We build on this work by deriving analytical relations for the mutual inclination that can be induced in an inner planetary system by a general planetary companion. We then simplify this result specifically for when the companion is on a wide orbit. Combining this result with our robust analytical treatment of transit probabilities, we can then derive a simple relation describing how the presence of an outer planetary companion affects the transit probability of an inner system due to long term interactions.</p><p>We also complement recent N-body simulations of Kepler-like systems interacting with an inclined outer planetary companion shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mustill et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hansen (2017)</ref> by using our robust treatment of transit probabilities to consider whether an outer planet with a range of masses, semi-major axes and inclinations can reduce an underlying population of Kepler double transiting systems enough to recover the observed number of single transiting systems through long term interactions only. We also investigate whether the presence of specific wide orbit planets in multiplanet systems preferentially predicts single transiting planets with a given distribution of radii and semi-major axes.</p><p>In §2 we overview our semi-analytical method for calculating the transit probability of two mutually inclined planets. In §3 we derive a simplified form to describe the evolution of the mutual inclination between two planets due to presence of an outer planetary companion. We show how this mutual inclination affects the transit probability of the two inner planets in §4. In §5 we apply this work to <ref type="bibr">Kepler-56, Kepler-68, HD 106315 and Kepler-48</ref> to place constraints on the inclination of the outer planets in these systems. In §6 we investigate whether a wide orbit planet in Kepler systems can decrease the number of observed two planet transiting systems enough to recover the observed abundances of single transiting systems. We finally discuss this work in §7 and conclude in §8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">SEMI-ANALYTICAL TRANSIT PROBABILITY</head><p>A planet on a circular orbit with a semi-major axis a and radius R p subtends a band of shadow across the celestial sphere due its orbital motion.

The dotted lines represent the centre of a transit region for a planet inclined to a fixed reference plane by ∆i. The solid lines refer to the boundaries of such transit regions for when R /a = 0.25. The area within these transit regions are identical, giving an identical single transit probability equal to 0.25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Single Planet Case</head><p>Consider some fixed reference plane where [ ˆ X, ˆ Y] define a pair of orthogonal directions in this plane, andˆZandˆ andˆZ defines a direction orthogonal to this plane as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The fixed reference frame in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> is assumed to be centred on a host star with radius R . The line of sight of an observer is considered to be randomly oriented over the surface of a celestial sphere with respect to this fixed reference plane.

The solid lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> show these boundaries for different values of ∆i, where R /a = 0.25. This value of R /a might be considered to be unrealistically large and is used for demonstration purposes only. In Appendix A we further discuss how the values of (θ 1 , φ 1 ) and (θ 2 , φ 2 ) in eq. (3) and eq. (4) respectively would be expected to change as ∆i is increased from ∆i = 0 → 90 • . An integration between the upper and lower boundaries of a transit region divided by the total surface area of the celestial sphere gives the associated single transit probability of the planet (R /a, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Borucki &amp; Summers (1984)</ref>). All of the transit regions shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> for different ∆i therefore contain identical areas and hence have identical single transit probabilities equal to 0.25. We note that if the planet has a non-negligible radius then the single transit probability becomes (R ± R p )/a for grazing and full transits respectively. Throughout this work however we assume that R p R .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Two Planet Case</head><p>Consider now a system containing two planets, both of which are on circular orbits with semi-major axes and radii of a 1 , a 2 and R p 1 , R p 2 respectively, where a 1 &lt; a 2 and the orbital planes are mutually inclined by ∆i (we give an exact definition for mutual inclination in §3). The probability that a randomly oriented observer will view both planets to transit (assuming the system is observed for long enough) is equal to the overlap area between the transit regions of both planets, divided by the total area of the celestial sphere. We refer to this probability as the double transit probability.</p><p>Therefore, using eq. (3) and eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> to find where the boundaries of the transit regions of each planet intersect, an outline of the overlap between the transit regions can be determined. The area of this overlap can subsequently be calculated by an appropriate integration, which when divided by 4π gives the double transit probability. How the double transit probability changes as a function of ∆i is shown by the blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, for when R /a 1 = 0.2 and R /a 2 = 0.1. We note that this result is consistent regardless of the choice of reference plane and the orientation of the orbital planes of both planets with respect to this reference plane (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ragozzine &amp; Holman (2010)</ref> for a further discussion). That is, the double transit probability depends on the mutual inclination between the two planets only (in addition to the physical size of the respective transit regions).</p><p>Depending on the value of ∆i, the double transit probability (P herein) can be split into three regimes (also discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ragozzine &amp; Holman (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brakensiek &amp; Ragozzine (2016)</ref>).</p><p>(1) For low values of ∆i, the transit region of the outer planet is enclosed within that of the inner planet. The double transit probability is therefore equal to R /a 2 .</p><p>(2) ∆i is large enough that the transit region of one planet is no longer fully enclosed inside the other, however there is still partial overlap for all azimuthal angles on the celestial sphere. The transition to this regime occurs for a value of ∆i = I 1 , which causes θ 1 in eq. (3) for both planets to be equal at φ 1 = π/2. Evaluating eq. (3) at this point gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">sin I 1 = −κ 2 (1 − κ 2 1 ) 1/2 + κ 1 (1 − κ 2 2 ) 1/2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where κ 1 = R /a 1 and κ 2 = R /a 2 for simplicity. We note that determining the overlap area of the two transit regions with an exact analytical expression in this regime is difficult and is commonly calculated by Monte Carlo techniques (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ragozzine &amp; Holman (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johansen et al.

(3) For large ∆i, the transit regions only overlap at the intersection of the two orbital planes. The transition to this regime occurs when ∆i = I 2 , where θ 1 for the inner planet is equal to θ 2 for the outer planet at φ 1 = φ 2 = π/2. Evaluating eq.

However there is a clear discrepancy for I 1 &lt; ∆i &lt; I 2 , for when there is partial overlap between the transit regions at all azimuthal angles. This highlights the need for semi-analytical methods like the one suggested here over purely analytical relations, to robustly calculate double transit probabilities at all values of ∆i. We note that our method also agrees well with the Monte Carlo treatment of double transit probabilities shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ragozzine &amp; Holman (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Calculating transit probabilities using the method outlined here is significantly more computationally efficient than equivalent Monte Carlo methods, as it is only necessary to solve combinations of eq.

From integrating around this overlap, the associated double transit probability is also exact and not subject to Monte Carlo noise effects from under-sampling the total number of line of sight vectors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">COMBINING TRANSIT PROBABILITIES WITH SECULAR THEORY</head><p>Considering two inner, initially coplanar planets and an outer inclined planetary companion, we combine the analysis of transit probabilities from §2 with secular interactions from §3 in two main ways. First in §4.1, we assume that the outer planet is not necessarily on a wide orbit. The evolution of the mutual inclination between the inner planets is therefore assumed to be given by the full Laplace-Lagrange solution derived in eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref>. The double transit probability of the inner two planets during this evolution is then calculated through the method outlined in §2. This provides the most accurate prediction for how the double transit probability of two inner planets evolves (in the low inclination limit) considering a given outer planetary companion. We make use of this method for a detailed discussion of how an outer planet affects an inner population of Kepler systems in §6. Second, in §4.2 we assume that the outer planetary companion is on a significantly wide orbit. The evolution of the mutual inclination between the inner two planets is therefore given by eq. (16) and eq. (17). Here we look to give a simple analytical form to describe the double transit probability of two inner planets, due to secular interactions with a given outer planetary companion. We make use therefore of simple analytical relations such as eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(7)</ref> to describe double transit probabilities. Comparing with the work in §4.1 allows for the accuracy of these approximations to be judged. We demonstrate in §5 how simple constraints can be placed on the inclination of an outer companion in specific systems using this method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Two planet system with an inclined companion</head><p>From <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> it is clear that if the amplitude of the mutual inclination between the inner two planets is large, then the associated double transit probability, P, will only be at a maximum value for a small proportion of the secular evolution. The presence of an outer inclined planet may therefore result in a significant reduction in the mean double transit probability P on long timescales. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows how both the mutual inclination and the double transit probability evolve with time for two inner planets from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, which are perturbed by an outer planetary companion with a semimajor axis, mass and inclination of a 3 = 2au and m 3 = 1M J and ∆i = 5 • respectively. Indeed, P is only at a maximum value for a small proportion of the secular evolution leading to a significant reduction in P compared with if the outer planet were not present. Furthermore, the left panels of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> show how P changes due to perturbations from an outer planet with the same range of parameters considered in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. As one may expect, through comparing the left panels of Figures 4 and 6, an outer planet which induces a large value of max|∆i 12 | also causes a significant reduction in the mean double transit probability of the inner two planets and vice versa for small values of max|∆i 12 |.</p><p>The left panels of <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> also suggest a clear boundary of a 3 , m 3 and ∆i, above which the outer planet causes P to be significantly reduced and below which P is unchanged.

An interesting quirk of this system is that the transiting planets, while being roughly coplanar, are misaligned to the stellar spin axis by ∼40 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Huber et al.

We next remove false positives, which refer to KOI light curves that are indicative of either an eclipsing binary, having significant contamination from a background eclipsing binary, showing significant stellar variability which mimics a planetary transit or where instrument artefacts have produced a transit like signal (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Coughlin et al.

We subsequently remove non planetary-like objects with radii &gt;22.4R ⊕ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Borucki et al.

(2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rowe &amp; Thompson (2015)</ref>). This gives our final sample of 3255 objects. We note that our choice of cuts means that KOI systems can become reduced in multiplicity. We find that our final sample includes systems which contain 1-6 candidates with N i = <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(1, 2, 3</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref>). Long period planets are also more abundant in the population of single transiting systems. This may not necessarily indicate that long period planets inherently favour being in single transiting systems, but instead they might be the inner planet of a higher multiplicity system where the outer planets are on too long a period to produce a significant transit signal.</p><p>Finally there appears to be an over abundance in the population of single transiting systems for planets with R p 2R ⊕ at periods P &lt; 10 days ( 0.03au) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lissauer et al.

(2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Steffen &amp; Coughlin (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lopez &amp; Rice (2016)</ref>). The formation processes which lead to these types of planets are unclear. It is also unknown if these objects are inherently rocky planets, or are the cores of Neptune sized planets whose envelopes have been irradiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dressing &amp; Charbonneau (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rogers (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lopez &amp; Rice (2016)</ref>). If these outlying systems are largely ignored, the question remains of whether the remaining planets in single transiting systems are part of the same underlying distribution of higher order planetary systems; i.e. could these single transiting systems contain similar planets which are not observed to transit?</p><p>For our dynamical analysis it is not the radii of these planets which is of relevance, rather their masses. We estimate the masses of planets according to the following mass-radius relations. For radii less than 1.5R ⊕ we use the rocky planet mass-radius relation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Weiss &amp; Marcy (2014)</ref>, where density (ρ p ) is related to radii (R p ) through ρ p = 2.43 + 3.39(R p /R ⊕ )gcm −3 . For radii 1.5 ≤ R p ≤ 4R ⊕ , we use the deterministic version of the probabilistic massradius relation for sub-Neptune objects from <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wolfgang et al. (2016)</ref>, where mass (M p ) is given by M p /M ⊕ = 2.7(R p /R ⊕ ) <ref type="bibr">1.3</ref> . Once radii become R p 4R ⊕ deterministic mass-radius relations become uncertain due to the onset of planetary contraction under self-gravity (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Kipping (2017)</ref>). From the mass-radius relations detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Kipping (2017)</ref>, we find their 'Neptunian worlds' deterministic relation of M p /M ⊕ = (1.23R p /R ⊕ ) 1.7 gives the most sensible masses for all planets with R p &gt; 4R ⊕ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">De-biasing the Kepler population</head><p>As previously alluded to, Kepler only observes planetary systems that have their orbital planes aligned with our line of sight. It is therefore sensible to suggest that there is a much larger, underlying population of planetary systems within which only some are observed to transit. We refer to this underlying population of planetary systems as the model population. Conversely, we refer to the population of planetary systems actually observed by Kepler as the Kepler population. We assume that Kepler systems are representative of planetary systems in the model population once geometrical biases have been taken into account.</p><p>To construct an underlying model population, our primary goal is for this to predict the correct number and planet parameter distribution seen in the Kepler population for systems with two transiting planets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Figure 8 right)</ref>. To achieve this we first assume that all stars either have two or zero planets. Any system which hosts two planets is assumed to be identical to one of the 341 double transiting systems observed by Kepler. We assume the abundance of a specific Kepler-like system in the model population is equal to the inverse of the mean of the double transit probability calculated by the method outlined in §2. Systems with inherently low mean double transit probabilities, are therefore probabilistically assumed to be more numerous in the model population. By definition therefore, each unique system in the model population would be expected to be observed with both planets transiting exactly once and so the model population predicts the correct distribution shown in the right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref>. We note that a model population generated in this way is similar to the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johansen et al. (2012)</ref>, albeit with their work predicting the correct number and planet parameter distribution seen in the Kepler population for systems with three transiting planets.</p><p>The sum of the inversed mean double transit probabilities of all the 341 double transiting systems gives the total number of planetary systems in the model population. If we assume that all of the two planet systems are coplanar, we find the model population includes 16517 systems (the remaining 148449 systems observed by Kepler are assumed to have no planets).</p><p>Each system in the model population can be observed to have a single transiting planet, depending on the viewing angle. The sum of the mean single transit probabilities for each of the 16517 systems in the coplanar model population gives the total number of single transiting planets, N sing , that would be expected to be observed. Here the mean single transit probability for a given system is equal to R /a 1 − R /a 2 , where a 1 , a 2 are the semi-major axes of each planet when a 2 &gt; a 1 and R is the radius of the host star. We find N sing = 589, which clearly underestimates the 1951 single transiting systems in the observed Kepler population, by a factor of ∼ 3. This is the Kepler dichotomy discussed in §1. We show the smoothed distribution of the semi-major axes and planet radii for these 589 predicted single transiting planets in the top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref>, which when compared with the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref> clearly shows an under-prediction of the single transiting planets observed by Kepler.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Inherently inclined multi-planet systems</head><p>From transit duration variation (TDV) studies, the mutual inclinations of planets in multi-transiting systems are small at 2 − 3 • ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fang &amp; Margot (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fabrycky et al. (2014)</ref>). We note that this mutual inclination also best fits the distribution of impact parameters in the Kepler population. Perhaps then, if two planets are assumed to be inherently mutually inclined by a small amount, this may account for the abundance of single transiting planets in the Kepler population. Consider a fixed mutual inclination ∆i 12 between the two planets in each of the 341 double transiting systems. The mean single transit probability for each planet from a given system, P sing,1 and P sing,2 respectively where P sing,1 &gt; P sing,2 , is now given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">P sing,1 = R a 1 − P P sing,2 = R a 2 − P,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where P is the mean double transit probability and P sing,1 + P sing,2 is the total mean single transit probability for this system. As ∆i 12 increases, the mean double transit probability decreases <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Therefore for a fixed population of double transiting systems considered here, the expected abundance of single transiting systems increases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> shows We show the distribution of the semi-major axes and radii of the expected single transiting planets for when ∆i = 4.4 • in the top right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref>. Comparing with the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref>, there is an over abundance of predicted single transiting planets with radii of ∼ 2.5R ⊕ and semimajor axes of ∼0.15au. This is due to the model population compensating for not being able to reproduce all types of single transiting planets in the Kepler population (e.g. Hot Jupiters discussed in §6.1). Herein therefore when discussing how well a model population predicts the Kepler population of single transiting planets we refer to how well the types of planets from each population compare, rather than the total number. That is, we look to find which value of ∆i 12 causes the associated version of the top right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref> to be most like the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref>.</p><p>We judge the success of this comparison using a modified χ 2 minimisation test, in which we simply sum the square of the difference between the number of singles with a given radius and semi-major axis expected from the model population, with that of the observed Kepler population. Varying ∆i <ref type="bibr">12</ref> we therefore look to identify a minimum in the modified χ 2 space without caring for the modified χ 2 value itself. We show this in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref>, with the modified χ 2 minimum occurring for ∆i <ref type="bibr">12</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref>). We note that the total number of single transiting planets expected from the model population for ∆i 12 = 3.6 • is 1504.</p><p>We assume therefore that the remaining 1951-1504 = 447 single transiting transiting planets in the Kepler population not fit by this model population are inherently single planet systems.</p><p>Despite the model population for ∆i 12 = 3.6 • giving the lowest modified χ 2 value, this mutual inclination is perhaps larger than that suggested by TDV studies. We note however that mutual inclination estimates from TDV studies consider a range of planet multiplicities. For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fang &amp; Margot (2012)</ref> consider a model population of planetary systems with 1-7+ planets and predict that ∼50% of observed planetary systems should contain a single planet, with the remaining systems containing multiple planets with mutual inclinations of 3 • . In order to properly predict the inherent mutual inclination in the multi-planet systems considered in this work therefore, it would be necessary to simultaneously model the TDV data directly. We consider such an analysis as part of future work. Instead in §6.4 we consider the possibility that Kepler planets form coplanar, but end up mutually inclined due to perturbations from an outer planetary companion on an inclined orbit. This may provide another way to predict the correct abundance of single transiting systems observed by Kepler, and also result in a low mutual inclination for those systems with two transiting planets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Including an inclined planetary companion</head><p>We now consider the effects of a hypothetical outer planet in each of the systems in the model population. We first amend the assumption from §6.2 and assume that all stars either host three or zero planets. Any system which hosts three planets is assumed to be identical to one of the 341 double transiting systems from the Kepler population plus an additional outer planet. The outer planet is assumed to have the same mass and semi-major axis in all systems and starts on an inclination to the inner planets when these are coplanar, causing the mutual inclination between the inner planets to evolve according to eq. (15). We assume that the outer planet satisfies the Hill stability criterion of ∆ = 2 √ 3 (Chambers (1999)) with the outer of the inner two planets for all 341 considered systems, where ∆ = (a 3 − a 2 )/R H and</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">R H = m 2 + m 3 3M 1/3 a 2 + a 3 2 ,</formula><p>where M is the stellar mass. If this criterion is not satisfied, we move the outer planet for this specific system until it is. For example, when the outer planet is assumed to have a semi-major axis and mass of 1au and 1M ⊕ respectively, we find 6 of the 341 systems do not satisfy this stability criterion and the outer planet needs to be moved to a mean semi-major axis of 1.2au. When the outer planet has a semimajor axis and mass of 1au and 10M J respectively we find 22 of the 341 systems do not satisfy the stability criterion and the outer planet needs to be moved to a mean semi-major axis of 1.4au. Each one of the 341 systems is again replicated enough times in the model population to be expected to be observed exactly once. That is, the inverse of the mean double transit probability of the inner two planets, gives the abundance of each of the 341 systems in the model population. The associated mean single transit probabilities for each of the inner two planets is of the same form as eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref>. The sum of the mean single transit probabilities for every system in the model population therefore again gives the abundance of a given single transiting planet that would be expected to be observed from the model population that also fits the number of double transiting systems.</p><p>Similarly to the modelling approach in §6.3, we look to identify which mass (m 3 ), semi-major axis (a 3 ) and initial inclination (∆i) of the outer planet causes the types of single transiting systems expected from the associated model population to be most like those in the observed Kepler population. For a given combination of a 3 , m 3 and ∆i we therefore calculate a modified χ 2 value described in §6.3. We show these modified χ 2 values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>  From the top panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>, it is clear that there is a 'valley' of semi-major axes and masses of the outer planet which causes a significantly lower modified χ 2 value. It can be assumed therefore that such an additional planet predicts single transiting systems whose radii and semi-major axes better fit those in the Kepler population. However there is also a distinct minimum in the modified χ 2 space when the outer planet has a semi-major axis of ∼1au for a mass of ∼30M ⊕ . Similarly in the other panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> there appear to be distinct minima. For the middle panel this occurs for an outer planet (of m 3 = 1M J ) with a semi-major axis of 1.38au, initially inclined to the inner planets by ∆i = 5.7 • . Finally for the bottom panel, this minimum occurs for a mass of ∼6M J and inclination of 6 • (where a 3 = 2au). Generally, we find the distribution of single transiting planets expected from the model population is more representative of those in the Kepler population for 3 ∆i 10 • .</p><p>The bottom right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 9</ref> gives the distribution of single transiting planets expected from the model population when the outer planet exists in a minimum of the modified χ 2 space with a 3 = 1.07au, m 3 = 24M ⊕ and ∆i=10 • (white circle in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>). We note that the total number of single transiting planets expected from this model population is 1564. The outer planet parameters which predict N sing = 1564 are shown by the white lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref>. This line highlights that while many outer planet parameters can predict N sing = 1564, some predict single transiting planets which are more representative of those in the Kepler population. We note that N sing predicted by the same range of outer planet parameters from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> is shown in Appendix C.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Combining inherently mutually inclined and outer planet populations</head><p>In reality it is likely that the total number of single planet transiting systems observed by Kepler (N sing,Kep = 1951) is contributed to by different populations of planetary systems. These may include a number of inherently single planet systems (N sing,inh ) in addition to a number of single transiting planets observed from a population of two planet systems which have a fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 (N sing,∆i 12 ). They may also include a number of single transiting planets which are observed from a population of initially coplanar two planet systems interacting with an inclined planetary companion (N sing,planet ). Hence in general, it can be considered that</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">N sing,Kep = N sing,inh + N sing,∆i 12 + N sing,planet .<label>(26)</label></formula><p>Here we make the assumption that the total number of double transiting systems observed by Kepler (N doub,Kep = 341) is made up of a fraction f that are two planet systems with an inherent mutual inclination and a fraction (1-f ) that are two planet systems with an inclined outer companion. We can thus rewrite eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">N sing,Kep = N sing,inh + f (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) ∆i 12 +(1 − f )(N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet ,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) ∆i 12 is the number of singles that would have been produced from the population of two planet systems with a fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 , had it been numerous enough to reproduce the 341 double transiting Kepler systems (which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 10</ref> as a function of ∆i 12 ). Conversely (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet is the number of singles that would have been produced from the population of two planet systems which are perturbed by an outer companion, had it been numerous enough to reproduce the 341 double transiting systems. We estimate the number of inherently single planet systems to be N sing,inh = 447 from §6.3. We note that N sing,inh will change for different values of ∆i 12 , however for simplicity we keep it constant at 447. For the assumed N sing,inh and an assumed fixed mutual inclination for the fraction of the double transiting systems that are inherently inclined ( f ), eq. <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> means that the number of single transiting systems observed by Kepler can be reproduced by specific combination with the fraction of double transiting systems that have an outer planet (1 − f ) and the properties of these planetary systems which determine the ratio of single to double transiting systems from this population (i.e. (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet ). This combination is plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, which can be read alongside <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure C1</ref> to determine the outer planet parameters required to reproduce the required (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet . For example, for f = 0.2 and ∆i 12 = 2 • , (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet = 1676 from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, which from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure C1</ref> would be reproduced by an outer planet with a 3 = 2au, m 3 = 132M ⊕ and ∆i = 10 • . For f = 0.5, (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet is increased to 2192 requiring the mass of this outer planet to be increased to m 3 = 955M ⊕ (for a 3 = 2au and ∆i = 10 • ). The outer planet parameters required to produce (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet are therefore extremely sensitive to the value of f . However, increasing the value of ∆i 12 for a given value of f increases the value of (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) ∆i 12 and hence decreases (N sing,Ndoub=341 ) planet as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>, requiring an outer planet which is a weaker perturber of the inner planets.</p><p>It should be noted that f and 1− f are not equivalent to the underlying fraction of stars that host a two planet system with a fixed mutual inclination, or a two planet system with an outer companion respectively. However if f is known, such fractions for the underlying population of stars can be estimated through occurrence rate calculations. We discuss such calculations of occurrence rates in §7.3, however it is first necessary to estimate a value for f , which we discuss below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Comparing inherently mutually inclined and outer planet populations</head><p>From §6.3 a sole population of two planet systems which are inherently mutually inclined by ∆i = 3.6 • (i.e. when f = 1) can reproduce a population of single and double transiting systems representative of those observed by Kepler ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure  9</ref>). However from §6.4 a sole population of two planet systems with an outer planet (i.e. f = 0) can also reproduce a population of single and double transiting systems representative of those observed by Kepler <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 11</ref>). Here we look to differentiate between these two models by considering the predicted distribution of mutual inclinations that would be observed in the two planet populations for each model. We note that combining these two models in a way described in §7.1 (i.e. when 0 &lt; f &lt; 1) would then give some intermediate distribution of mutual inclinations between the overall two planet population. For the model in which the two planets have an inherent mutual inclination of ∆i = 3.6 • , that distribution is narrowly peaked at 3.6 • (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13)</ref>. In contrast, for the model in which two planets are perturbed by an inclined outer planet, the distribution of mutual inclinations is biased toward coplanar systems. This is because, while the outer planet induces a significant mutual inclination between the inner planets, as required to reproduce the correct ratio of single to double transiting systems, the inclination is not always large (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>) and the probability of witnessing a double transit system is much higher when their mutual inclination is low. Consider an outer companion with m 3 = 24M ⊕ , a 3 = 1.07au and ∆i = 10 • , which was in a minimum of the modified χ 2 space (white circle, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  11</ref> top). Weighting the secularly evolving mutual inclinations between the inner two planets in the 341 considered systems by the associated double transit probability gives the predicted distribution of mutual inclinations which are most likely to be observed. This distribution is shown by the black line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>. It is clear that the most likely observed mutual inclination is when the inner two planets are coplanar. Moreover the number of systems expected to be observed with mutual inclinations beyond 0.5 • drops to negligible values.</p><p>From transit duration variation studies, the distribution of mutual inclinations between planets in multi-planet Kepler systems is peaked at ∼ 2 • <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fang &amp; Margot (2012);</ref><ref type="bibr">Fab- rycky et al. (2014)</ref>), noting however that these works consider different planet populations to those considered here as discussed in §6.3. Combining the two above models to produce a similar distribution in mutual inclinations may therefore allow for f to be determined. We look to combine the two models in such a way to predict a value of f , as well as modelling the TDVs of the planetary systems considered in this work directly to predict the distribution of inherent mutual inclinations, as part of future work. For example if a fraction of two planet systems observed by Kepler are considered to have a fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 = 4 • , then in order to reproduce a distribution of mutual inclinations that peaks at ∼2 • from modelling of TDVs, it might be expected that f ∼ 0.5.</p><p>An additional method to estimate f might be to consider whether hypothetical outer planets considered in this work would have been detectable by other means. It is expected that RV studies would be most sensitive to such outer planetary companions. On <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> we plot a rough constraint from RV studies, shown by the red dashed lines, assuming a detection threshold of ∼2m/s. Outside of 5au we assume RV studies are not sensitive to planets due to long periods. Planets above or to the left of these lines would therefore be detectable with this level of RV precision. This detection threshold suggests that a wide orbit planet located in the minima of the modified χ 2 values in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> (white circle) should be just detectable by RV studies. This would assume however that all Kepler systems with two planets host this outer companion i.e. f = 0. From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> and highlighted in §7.1, if f &gt; 0 a planet with a larger mass, shorter period or larger inclination is required to reproduce the total number of single transiting systems observed by Kepler. Such outer planets should be readily detectable by RV surveys. For example, for the values of f = 0.2 and f = 0.5 for ∆i 12 = 2 • considered in §7.1, both of the outer planets in these cases would be expected to be detectable by RV surveys. Due to the inherent faintness of Kepler stars, few have been extensively studied for wide orbit planets. We suggest therefore that detailed follow-up RV studies of Kepler systems would allow for f to be constrained. Generally for example, a low yield of outer planets in RV studies would suggest that f is low and vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Occurrence Rates</head><p>Similar to that discussed specifically for Kepler systems in §7.1, consider that the underlying population of planetary systems contains three possible types of planetary systems. These include inherently single planet systems, two planet systems which have a fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 and two planet systems which are being perturbed by an inclined outer planet. In §7.1 it was shown that combining these systems with a free parameter f , which describes the fraction of the observed double transiting population that are two planet systems with a fixed mutual inclination, recovers the total number of single and double transiting systems observed by Kepler. However this value of f is not the same as the fraction of the underlying population of stars that have two planets that are inherently mutually inclined. Here we define the occurrence rate of a given population to be the fraction of stars which would be expected to host such systems. Occurrence rates in this work can be estimated by taking the ratio of the number of systems in a given model population (N mod ) to the total number of stars observed by Kepler (N Kep ). The individual occurrence rates for the inherently single planet systems is therefore given by (N mod /N Kep ) inh , for the two planet systems with the fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 by (N mod /N Kep ) ∆i 12 and for the two planet systems being perturbed by an inclined outer planet by (N mod /N Kep ) planet . For example, for the population of two planet systems which were inherently mutually inclined by 3.6 • (for when f = 1), i.e. those which predicted a population of single transiting planets representative of those observed by <ref type="bibr">Kepler ( §6.3)</ref>, the number of systems in the model population was equal to 43807. From §6.1 the total number of Kepler stars was 164966. Therefore the occurrence rate for this type of system, (N mod /N Kep ) ∆i 12 = 27%. Conversely, considering the population of two planet systems which were perturbed by an outer companion with m 3 = 24M ⊕ , a 3 = 1.07au and ∆i = 10 • (white circle <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 11</ref> top) for when f = 0, predicted 42733 systems in the associated model population. Therefore the associated occurrence rate of this type of system (N mod /N Kep ) planet = 26%.</p><p>The calculation of the occurrence rate for the population of inherently single planet systems is slightly different to that described above. From §6.3, assume that there are 447 inherently single planet systems (noting that this is subject to the value of ∆i 12 ). The distribution of the semimajor axes of these 447 planets is equal to the difference between the distributions of semi-major axes for the single transiting systems observed by Kepler and those predicted by the population of two planet systems with a fixed mutual inclination of ∆i 12 = 3.6 • , i.e. the difference between the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref>). We therefore expect that our population of inherently single planet systems is dominated by a different population, such as those described in §6.1 which are poorly constrained.</p><p>In a similar way to that described for eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(27)</ref>, the total occurrence rate of assumed planetary systems in the underlying population of planetary systems can be estimated to be</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">N mod N Kep tot = N mod N Kep inh + f N mod N Kep ∆i 12 + (1 − f ) N mod N Kep planet .

Combining with the occurrence rate of inherently single planet systems estimated above, the total occurrence rate of planetary systems becomes 34%. This is similar to occurrence rates of ∼ 25% − 30% for Kepler like planets derived from injection and recovery analysis of planet candidates from the Kepler pipeline ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Petigura et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Chris- tiansen et al.

(2008)</ref> suggest an occurrence rate of 7.0 ± 1.4% for planets with masses and semi-major axes of m p = 1-10M J and ∼1-5au respectively. Extrapolating this occurrence rate also predicts that 17-20% of stars have gas giants within 20au. Similarly <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Mayor et al. (2011)</ref> suggest an occurrence rate of 13.9 ± 1.7% for planets with masses and periods of m p &gt; 50M ⊕ and P &lt; 10yrs respectively. More recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bryan et al. (2016)</ref> suggest that for systems with 1 or 2 RV planets, the occurrence rate of an additional companion with a mass and semi-major axis of 1-20M J and 5-20au respectively is as high as 52 ± 5%. The above example occurrence rate for the systems with an outer planet, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">(1 − f )(N mod /N Kep ) planet ∼21%</formula><p>, is then therefore not contradicted by these studies. However, this example assumed an estimated value of f . In addition to the methods described in §7.2, observationally estimated occurrence rates for outer planets may also be able to constrain the value of f . For example if it is assumed that the occurrence rate of the types of outer planets considered in this work is 13.9% <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mayor et al.

As (N mod /N Kep ) planet 1 (i.</formula><p>e. it is unphysical that there are more stars in the model population than the number actually observed by Kepler), this results in an upper limit of f ≤ 0.86. We suggest therefore that combining this method of placing constraints on f with those described in §7.2 might provide a strong constraint on the percentage of planetary systems which may share a fixed mutual inclination compared with systems that may host an outer inclined planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Comparing with similar works</head><p>Whether an outer planet can reduce the multiplicity of expected transiting planets in an inner planetary system in the context of N-body simulations has recently been investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hansen (2017)</ref>. A notable example they include is the effect of a companion with a mass of 1M J at 1au, which is inclined to an inner population of planetary systems with a variety of multiplicities by 10 • . They find the ratio of the total number of double to single transiting systems that Kepler would be expected to observe is 0.184 (i.e. ∼5 times more expected single than double transiting systems). We find an identical outer planetary companion in our work gives this ratio to be 0.14. We suggest this difference is caused by the population of inner planetary systems used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hansen (2017)</ref> incorporate 50 model inner planetary systems with a range of multiplicities (the vast majority contained 3-6 planets at the end of their simulations), rather than the two planet Kepler systems considered in this work. Higher multiplicities increases the number of competing secular modes in the system, which can stabilise inner planets against the secular perturbations of an outer companion (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Read &amp; Wyatt (2016)</ref>). Such an example was shown in this work in §5 for application to Kepler-48. Perhaps then, mutual inclinations are more easily induced between inner planets in this work, increasing the predicted number of single transiting planets that Kepler would be expected to observe, relative to a fixed population of planetary systems.</p><p>Moreover compared with N-body simulations, our work does not allow for dynamical instability. If inclinations are large then they couple with eccentricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Murray &amp; Dermott (1999)</ref>), potentially causing orbital crossings between neighbouring planets leading to dynamical instabilities on short, non-secular timescales. Indeed Hansen (2017) find for the above mentioned outer planetary companion that roughly half of the 50 systems they consider lose at least one planet. Moreover <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pu &amp; Wu (2015)</ref> suggest that the abundance of single and double transiting systems might be the remains of higher order planetary systems that were once tightly packed and have since undergone dynamical instability. A detailed discussion on how dynamical stability would be expected to affect our results is difficult. Our choice that all planets must be initially Hill stable is by no means a robust constraint on the long term stability of all the planetary systems we consider during the secular interaction.</p><p>The effects of dynamical instability in tightly packed planet systems interacting with a wide orbit companion planet was also shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mustill et al. (2015)</ref>. They find that an outer giant planet undergoing Kozai-Lidov interactions with a stellar binary <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kozai (1962)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lidov (1962)</ref>) can have an eccentricity which takes its orbit within the inner planets, leading to a significant reduction in planet multiplicity. Moreover more recent work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mustill et al. (2016)</ref> suggests that these same interactions can cause ∼50% of Kepler like systems to lose a planet, either through collisions or ejections. If inclination is not completely decoupled with eccentricity then, these works suggest that dynamical instability plays a significant role in sculpting an inner planetary system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.5">Metallicity Distribution</head><p>The fraction of stars with gas giants increases with higher metal content (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gonzalez (1996)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Thorngren et al.

If single transiting planets are in systems which contain an outer giant companion similar to that considered in this work then the transiting planet should follow a similar metallicity relation as the giant planet. If there is an inherent population of single planet systems with R p 4R ⊕ , in addition to a population of inherently mutually inclined double transiting systems, then these systems will follow a different metallicity relation. Therefore the population of single and double transiting systems observed by Kepler may contain a mixture of metallicity relations. If a distinction can be made between these different relations then this may place constraints on the presence of additional planets in Kepler systems with a single transiting planet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.6">Assumptions of this work</head><p>Throughout this work we have considered mutual inclinations evolve between two planets due to secular interactions with an outer planet. As stated above, increasing the multiplicity of planetary systems complicates the evolution of mutual inclinations. For application to the Kepler dichotomy, including higher multiplicity systems may cause proportionally fewer to be observed as single transiting systems. We look to investigate this as part of future work. Moreover higher multiplicity systems also allow for investigation into whether the presence of an outer planetary companion can explain the number of higher order systems observed by Kepler. This is of particular interest as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johansen et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In summary, during the first part of this work we developed a semi-analytical method for the calculation of transit probabilities by considering the area a transiting planet subtends on a celestial sphere ( §2). Applying this method to a general two planet system, we showed how the probability that both planets are observed to transit changes as they become mutually inclined.</p><p>In §3 we discussed how the mutual inclination between two initially coplanar planets evolves due to secular interactions with an external mutually inclined planetary companion. We derived the full solution describing this evolution assuming that the mutual inclination remains small, before simplifying it under the assumption that the external planet was on a wide orbit. We found that the maximum mutual inclination between the inner two planets is approximately equal to twice the initial mutual inclination with the external planet. Below this the maximum mutual inclination between the inner two planets scales according to the mass, semi-major axis and inclination of the external planet by ∝ ∆im 3 /a 3 3 . How the secular interaction causes the double transit probability of the inner two planets to evolve was shown in §4. Assuming that this double transit probability is significantly reduced when the maximum mutual inclination exceeds ≈ (R /a 1 ) + (R /a 2 ) we derived an expression for the mean of the double transit probability considering a given external planetary companion. This expression was applied to <ref type="bibr">Kepler-56, Kepler-68, and Kepler-48</ref> to place constraints on the inclination of the outer RV detected planets in these systems in §5. We found that the inner two transiting planets in <ref type="bibr">Kepler-56 and Kepler-68</ref> are not significantly secularly perturbed by the outer planets, regardless of their inclination. For HD 106315 we find that an outer planet inferred from recent RV analysis can cause a significant perturbation to the mutual inclination of two internal transiting planets. Moreover we find that if the outer planet is present within ∼1au, its inclination must be no more than 2.4 • , otherwise the probability of observing both the inner planets to transit is significantly reduced. We also found that the RV detected planet in Kepler-48 needs to be inclined with respect to the inner planets by 3.7 • , otherwise the probability that all the inner planets are observed to transit is significantly reduced. We conclude therefore that using the expression for the mean transit probability between inner planets from eq. (20) and (17) can be used to place significant constraints on the inclinations of RV detected planets, whose host systems also contain transiting planets.</p><p>We further applied our method of calculating transit probabilities to the Kepler population in §6. We found that relative to a fixed population of transiting systems with two planets on initially coplanar orbits, the expected number of single transiting systems can be significantly increased both by inherently inclining the two planets and by introducing an outer planetary companion. We found that an inherent mutual inclination of ∆i 12 = 3.6 • predicts a population of single transiting planets most representative of those in the Kepler population. Moreover, we found that outer planets initially inclined by ∼ 3 − 10 • to the inner planets also predict a representative population of single transiting systems. These outer planets should be detectable by RV studies.</p><p>However it is likely that planetary systems observed by Kepler may include a combination of systems which include inherently single planet systems, two planet systems which have some fixed mutual inclination and two planet systems interacting with an inclined outer planet. For two planet systems which are perturbed by an outer planet, the distribution of the mutual inclinations between the inner planets of such systems is biased toward coplanar systems. This is due to an increased probability of observing inner planets when coplanar compared with when mutual inclinations are larger. We suggest that combining populations of inherently mutually inclined two planet systems with two planet systems which are interacting with an outer planet may be able to reproduce the observed distribution of mutual inclinations between Kepler planets. In doing so, this may provide constraints on the presence of outer planets in the Kepler population. We suggest also that detailed follow-up of RV studies in Kepler systems will provide a more direct constraints on the presence of outer planets. There should also be a dichotomy in the number of transiting systems observed by the upcoming TESS mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ricker et al. (2014)</ref>), however for these systems astrometry and RV techniques will be able to be used to verify the presence and influence of outer planets. where θ * 1 2 &gt; 0, θ * 2 2 &gt; 0.</p></div>

The red line shows the mu- tual inclination between Kepler-48b and c (∆i bc ), the blue between b and d (∆i bd ), and the green between c and d (∆i cd ). The mutual inclination between Kepler-48b and c is largely unchanged and they remain roughly coplanar. Conversely the mutual inclination between b and d and c and d is sig- nificant and roughly equal throughout the secular evolution. It can be assumed for Kepler-48 therefore that the inner two transiting planets are largely unaffected by the secular per- turbations of Kepler-48e, but both can become significantly mutually inclined to the outer transiting planet. As such, we assume that Kepler-48b and c can be treated as a single body whose angular momentum is the sum of Kepler48-b and c, reducing the system to a total of three planets. With this approximation, the evolution of the mutual inclination between Kepler-48b and c with d (∆i bc,d ) is shown by the dashed black line in Figure 7.

We briefly discuss these differences here for future reference. Large planets with short periods i.e. Hot Jupiters, are not present in Kepler sys- tems with two transiting planets. Indeed, investigations into the formation processes of Hot Jupiters predict a lack of close companions (Wright et al. (2009); Steffen et al. (2012); Mustill et al. (2015); Huang et al. (2016), see WASP-47 for an exception, Becker et al. (2015); Almenara et al.</figDesc></figure>

A method for debiasing Kepler systems to a general population of planetary systems is described in §6.2. We consider the scenario where planets share some inherently fixed mutual inclination in §6.3, before considering when this mutual in- clination is evolving due to the presence of an outer inclined planetary companion in §6.4. We note from the outset that we do not consider Kepler systems observed to have more than two planets. Instead we look to explore what effects an outer planet might have on observables of a subset of Kepler like systems, rather than observables of the whole Kepler population.</figDesc><table>We discuss this assumption further in

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A1 Central Transit Line</head><p>The centre of the transit region is defined by eq. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> − sin ∆i sin θ sin φ + cos ∆i cos θ = 0, Assuming that φ = 0 → 2π and that a corresponding value of θ for each value of φ can be in the range of 0 &lt; θ &lt; π, eq. (2) can be rearranged to give</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A2 Upper Transit Boundary</head><p>The upper boundary of a transit region is given by eq. <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> − sin ∆i sin θ 2 sin φ 2 + cos ∆i cos θ 2 = − χ, A value of θ 2 for a given φ 2 can be calculated through solving a quadratic of the form</p><p>Depending on the value of ∆i, the calculation of θ 2 for a given value of φ 2 can be grouped into three different regimes, <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> ∆i is small enough that the upper boundary of the transit region never crosses the fixed reference plane. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> ∆i is large enough that the upper boundary of the transit region does cross the fixed reference plane. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> For high values of ∆i the upper transit boundary only has values of θ 2 for 0 &lt; φ 2 &lt; π. This can be thought of as the transit region going over the pole of the celestial sphere. For regime (1), the value of θ 2 for a given φ 2 is equivalent to that obtained from the positive root of eq. (A2), mirrored about π/2. The transition to regime (2) occurs for when the upper transit boundary first crosses the fixed reference plane. Here ∆i = arcsin( χ). As ∆i is increased beyond this value the intersection between the upper transit boundary and the fixed reference plane occurs at φ 2 = φ 0 and φ 2 = π − φ 0 , for which θ 2 = π/2. From eq. (4) φ 0 is given by φ 0 = arcsin( χ/sin ∆i). Therefore θ 2 &lt; π/2 for φ 0 &lt; φ 2 &lt; π − φ 0 and θ 2 &gt; π/2 otherwise. When φ 0 &lt; φ 2 &lt; π − φ 0 , θ 2 is hence obtained from the positive solution of eq. (A2) and by the positive solution mirrored about π/2 otherwise.</p><p>Finally the transition to regime (3) occurs when ∆i = arccos( χ). Similarly to regime (2) as ∆i is increased beyond this value, the upper transit boundary crosses the fixed reference plane at φ 2 = φ 0 and φ 2 = π − φ 0 and hence θ 2 is only defined for when φ 0 &lt; φ 2 &lt; π − φ 0 . The solution from eq. (A2) which gives the smaller value θ 2 corresponds to θ 2 &gt; π/2 values and needs to be mirrored about π/2, with the solution giving the larger value of θ 2 corresponding to θ 2 &lt; π/2 values.</p><p>To summarize consider that for a given value of φ 2 , eq. (A2) gives two solutions for θ 2 , denoted as θ * 1 2 and θ * 2 2 respectively. For ∆i &lt; arcsin( χ),</p></div>			</div>
