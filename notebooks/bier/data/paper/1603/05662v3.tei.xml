			<abstract>
				<p>Observational biases distort our view of nature, such that the patterns we see within a surveyed population of interest are often unrepresentative of the truth we seek. Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data set on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 au of their star. However, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and detection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational biases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By assuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability , we infer the expected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a marginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against which to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery simulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our results explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a non-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial geometries. We also find that the geometric bias towards observed planets transiting near periastron is attenuated by the longer durations which occur near apoastron. Finally, we predict that the observational bias with respect to ratio-of-radii is super-quadratic, scaling as (R P /R) 5/2 , driven by an enhanced geometric transit probability and modestly longer durations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The occurrence rate and properties of extrasolar planetary systems has been an active area of astronomical research in recent years. These topics pertain to our uniqueness in the cosmos and affect the technical requirements of future instrumentation (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dalcanton et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The primary Kepler Mission, which was designed to be a statistical mission, has provided a wealth of data to address these questions. By detecting the decrement in stellar brightness caused by planets passing in front of their stars, Kepler has uncovered more than 4000 planetary candidates to date ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burke et al. 2015</ref>). However, the transit method, whilst evidently highly successful, is also plagued with several severe and well-known observational biases. Specifically, two dominant forms of bias obscure our view of the true exoplanet population: a geometric bias and a detection bias. For example, the former leads to a bias towards detecting short-period planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Beatty &amp; Gaudi 2008)</ref> and the latter leads to a bias towards larger planets.</p><p>Correcting for these biases is crucial when interpreting the Kepler data to make inferences about the underly-E-mail: dkipping@astro.columbia.edu ing population. The most assured approach for correcting for these biases is a full end-to-end numerical simulation of the detection efficiency (e.g. see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chris- tiansen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015)</ref>. In such a simulation, one generates a population of fake planets, creates corresponding fake time series with transits, and pushes the fake time series through the detection pipeline of interest to numerically compute the detection efficiency as a function of the input parameters.</p><p>These numerical approaches are tailored to the specific mission of interest and may be sensitive to the assumed population of injected planets. Nevertheless, this method is undoubtedly the most robust way to perform bias corrections on complex data sets like Kepler. Despite this, we argue that there is also great value in considering the problem of bias correction analytically. Analytic investigations can provide a deeper understanding of the underlying problem than possible through Monte Carlo simulations, which can often obscure the explanations of observed patterns. Moreover, analytic results can be interpreted in any context, rather than being tailored to a specific mission. This approach therefore complements the numerical work, offering insights into which trends are instrument-specific and which are inherent to transit surveys.</p><p>Several previous works have investigated some of the biases affecting transit surveys analytically. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes (2007)</ref> showed that the geometric bias of transits favors the detection of eccentric transiting planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burke (2008)</ref> extended upon these ideas and showed how the transit duration is also affected by orbital eccentricity, leading to an overall decrease in the detectability of eccentric planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beatty &amp; Gaudi (2008)</ref> consider the overall detection yield from a transit survey in an analytic framework, revealing the dependence on orbital period.</p><p>In these previous works, the transit light curves were assumed to be well-approximated by a simple box-like shape. Whilst a reasonable first approximation, this assumption prohibits the investigation of V-shaped grazing transits and is, as we show later, an assumption which could be relaxed without abandoning an analytic framework. Additionally, previous works tend to focus on the expected detection yields from transit surveys (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beatty &amp; Gaudi 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burke 2008)</ref>, as opposed to how the observed population parameters are modified by the various biases. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kipping (2014)</ref>, we used conditional probability to explore the distortion to the eccentricity distribution, but that work was limited to just geometric bias (i.e., no detection bias) and also only considered eccentricity and argument of periastron.</p><p>In this paper, we aim to build upon the aforementioned works to derive the effect of both geometric and detection bias on the basic parameters observable with transits. By using a trapezoidal transit model, we also investigate the limit of grazing transits and use our model to explain previously observed trends from the Kepler transit survey.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In §2, we derive an analytic expression for the SNR of a trapezoidal transit, including grazing geometries. In §3, we show how making some approximations to this result allows us to write down a simple form for the joint distribution of the transit parameters. We build upon this work in §4, deriving a more accurate set of expressions for the joint and marginalized distributions that result and extending the formalism to include occultations. Finally, we summarize our findings in §5.</p></div>

In such instances, δ &lt; p 2 and requires calculating the area of partial overlap between the planet's disc and that of the star.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Approximating the SNR equation</head><p>In order to understand the relationship between SNR and impact parameter, b, we need to rewrite Equation (16) by evaluating the various durations. To this end, we employ the "one term" transit duration function from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kipping (2010)</ref> (Equation 15 of that work) in what follows.

We then proceed to make a small-angle approximation on the inverse sine functions (sin −1 (x) x) within the duration terms, equivalent to assuming a R 1, which is valid for the vast majority of exoplanets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Probability of detection</head><p>In what follows, we use the symboî d to denote 'transit detected.' Let us group the various parameters in Equation <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> into a vector Θ = {p, b, P, ρ , e, ω}. We define the probability of detecting a transit conditioned upon these transit parameters and the fact that the system geometry permits the planet to transit at all as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

Whilst this statement is intuitive, it is worth pausing to consider its validity in the case of the most comprehensive transit survey to date, Kepler.</p><p>The formal criterion for a Kepler detection is that the transit events display an SNR exceeding 7.1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jenkins et al. 2010</ref>). This assumption implies that the probability of detection, Pr( ˆ d|Θ, ˆ b), follows a cumulative normal distribution centred on 7.1 with a standard deviation of unity <ref type="bibr">(Chris- tiansen et al. 2015</ref>), as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>In practice, this simple model has been found to be an unrealistic representation of the Kepler detections, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fressin et al.

However, recently, <ref type="bibr">Chris- tiansen et al.

However, in such a regime, the transit surveys are complete, detection bias plays no role, and one may use the geometric bias terms derived in this work alone.</p></div>

In practice, the intrinsic distribution is unlikely to be truly separable (even if assumed so for convenience). In particular, the distribution of ratio-of-radii, p, is likely covariant with terms such as ρ . This means that inverse sampling from the overall prior will be hierarchically conditional, assuming it is even possible to write down a closed form for such a distribution. For this reason, we argue that inverse transform sampling is not a practical way of sampling the distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Using the conditional probability distributions as a prior</head><p>As a brief aside, we discuss here why generally we do not recommend blindly using the derived conditional probabilities as priors in the analysis of individual transiting planets.</p><p>To centre the discussion, we first consider the case of the mean stellar density, ρ . The likelihood function of a real transit fit exhibits a strong negative covariance between ρ and b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter et al. 2008</ref>). Our derived bias terms favour a low ρ and a low b, i.e., they are positively covariant. Furthermore, the exponential ρ bias quickly outweighs the softer b bias, and thus, when convolved with the likelihood effect, transit fits would tend to be driven towards low ρ parameter space but high, near-grazing b. This means the b bias is essentially washed out, and the overall fit is driven towards low ρ .</p><p>One reason why this is problematic is that, thanks to our knowledge of stellar evolution, we understand that lowdensity stars will have larger stellar radii, and therefore, the same sized planet is less likely to be detected around a lowdensity than a high-density star. This problem could be resolved if we actually knew the true joint (and covariant) intrinsic prior of ρ and p, which would correct for this effect. Of course, the intrinsic prior is generally unavailable.</p><p>Since many of the transit parameters display covariance in the likelihood function to some extent ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter et al. 2008)</ref>, particularly in the case of realistic transits with limb darkening and sparse sampling, the above effect is general. For these reasons, we do not advocate blindly using these distributions as priors in individual transit light-curve fits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">A more accurate SNR</head><p>Based on the analytical form for the SNR of a trapezoidal transit and the geometric bias of the transit method, we have derived the conditional probability of the basic transit parameters for a planet detected to transit, Pr(Θ|ˆdΘ|ˆ Θ|ˆd, ˆ b). In order to do this, we made various approximations to the SNR expression shown in Equation (16).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Updated joint conditional probability distribution</head><p>The joint probability distribution of the transit parameters, conditioned upon the fact that a planet transits and the transit is detectable, is directly proportional to the SNR, as shown in Equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>.

The bias evident in Pr(b|ˆdb|ˆ b|ˆd, ˆ b) is likely unfamiliar to the reader, but we show later in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref> that it provides a good match to observations. For the more advanced case, calculating the onedimensional marginalized Pr(p|ˆdp|ˆ p|ˆd, ˆ b) and Pr(b|ˆdb|ˆ b|ˆd, ˆ b) can only be accomplished by assuming an intrinsic distribution for Pr(p) and Pr(b). For impact parameter b, a uniform prior is reasonable and expected, but p is somewhat non-trivial. Before tackling this issue, though, the fact that we can define Pr(b) means we can marginalize it out to derive Pr(p|ˆdp|ˆ p|ˆd, ˆ b). Doing so leads to a highly elaborate expression (which cannot be compactly written out here) involving generalized hypergeometric functions.</p><p>Plotting our solved function Pr(p|ˆdp|ˆ p|ˆd, ˆ b) (which is purely dependent on p) in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> reveals that the function is superquadratic with respect to p. This implies that if one assumed a detection bias of p 2 , one would underestimate the true number of small planets, since the bias towards p is actually sharper. Additionally, we observe that the plotted function closely resembles a power-law, for which we can fit the index. We therefore approximate</p><formula xml:id="formula_121">Pr(p|ˆdp|ˆ p|ˆd, ˆ b) ∝ p α Pr(p).<label>(45)</label></formula><p>A least-squares fit of samples suggests α = 2.424, but plotting even α = 5/2 reveals excellent agreement. It is important to stress that this value is not dependent upon any assumption regarding the intrinsic distributions, except that <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Coloured lines show the analytic (but highly elaborate) functional dependence of Pr( ˆ d, ˆ b|b) with respect to b, the observational bias to transit impact parameter. The black line shows the same bias derived in the small-planet (p → 0) limit of a box-like transit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_122">~(�-� � ) �/� ~(�-� � ) �/� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� �(�  ��  |�) ∨ �&lt;��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ������ ���������� � ����� �������</formula><p>impact parameter is uniformly distributed and separable from p. Under this assumption, and the assumption that detectability is proportional to SNR, geometric effects conspire to favour the detection of planets with a scaling of p 5/2 . We also tried repeating the derivation marginalizing over only b &lt; 1 − p, which is equivalent to insisting that Vshaped transits are not considered 'detections.' This line, plotted in pink in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>, reveals a turn-over at p = 0.696, since it is increasingly unlikely for the disc of a large planet to fully pass in front of the star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">The case of b</head><p>We are unable to derive a closed-form expression for the marginalized distribution of Pr(b|ˆdb|ˆ b|ˆd, ˆ b). Instead, we perform the integral numerically over a grid of b values in order to plot the functional form of the expression. For this calculation, we assume that the logarithm of p is distributed uniformly from 10 −3 to a fixed upper limit, which we try varying.</p><p>The results, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, illustrate that the functional form is generally flat at low b and follows the approximate shape of the simple form derived earlier (i.e.</p><p>(1 − b 2 ) 1/4 ).

Whilst a closed-form expression was not found, numerically marginalizing over e for three different choices of the Beta shape parameters allows us to visualize the effect of the detection bias, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.</p><p>In this figure, we compare the results of including both detection bias and geometric bias (this work), versus the geometric bias alone (expressions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kipping 2014)</ref>. It is clear that our expressions significantly suppress the ω biases, leading to a population more evenly distributed with respect to ω. This can be understood by considering that apoastron transits, whilst geometrically disfavoured, have a significant detection enhancement due to their longer transit durations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this work, we have derived the joint probability distribution of the basic transit parameters conditioned upon two observational biases affecting this type of measurement: geometric bias and detection bias. By treating the transit as a trapezoid, accounting for grazing events, and using conditional probability theory, we have derived an analytic, closed form for these biases (see Equation 34). Whereas previous works have used analytic arguments to predict the detection yields of transit surveys subject to observational biases (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beatty &amp; Gaudi 2008)</ref>, the focus here is the distortion of the observed transit parameter distributions away from those of the underlying exoplanet population. Inferences about the properties of Kepler planets are strongly affected by geometric and detection bias, and our work provides a general framework to interpret the observed trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>���</head><p>Our work is not intended to replace numerical Monte Carlo simulations, which typically perform injection/recovery tests through a detection pipeline (e.g. see <ref type="bibr">Pe- tigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Christiansen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dressing &amp; Char- bonneau 2015)</ref>. These results, tailored to a specific mission, have both advantages in their flexibility and disadvantages in obscuring the mechanisms responsible for various trends. In this sense, our work complements numerical efforts by providing insight into what observational trends are inherent to the transit technique, rather than effects localized to a particular survey. We highlight here several important results from our work.</p><p>We predict that observational bias should lead to a nonuniform distribution in the impact parameters of detected transiting planets. This prediction may be tested with the Kepler catalogue, for which we turn to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Swift et al. (2015)</ref>, who derived homogeneous posterior distributions for the basic transit parameters, including b, of 163 Kepler planetary candidates. The cumulative distributions of these terms are shown in <ref type="figure">fig. 9</ref> of that work, of which we reproduce a version in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref> here.</p><p>Despite the fact that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Swift et al. (2015)</ref> impose a uniform prior on b, the overall distribution drops off at high b, reproducing our expectation that such cases are indeed less frequent in a SNR-limited survey like Kepler. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref> compares the measured distribution to that predicted by our function Pr(b|ˆdb|ˆ b|ˆd, ˆ b) in the simple case 2 of Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(27)</ref>, which displays a reasonable match to the observed shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observational biases for transiting planets 9</head><p>Aside from providing an explanation for the distribution of impact parameters observed in real data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Swift et al. 2015</ref>), we highlight two other important results from our work. First, we update the well-known eccentricity bias of transits <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barnes 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Burke 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kipping 2014</ref>) to include detection bias. We find that the previously reported bias of transiting planets towards being preferentially near periastron is substantially relaxed by virtue of near-apoastron transits being much longer and thus more detectable. Equation (47) provides a general formulation to correct for the eccentricity bias for any assumed intrinsic distribution.</p><p>Finally, we highlight that we find the observational bias of transits with respect to the ratio-of-radii, p, is not quadratic (i.e. p 2 ), as commonly assumed, but actually super-quadratic and well-approximated by p 5/2 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> and Section 4.3.1). Critically, this result is independent of any assumption about the intrinsic distribution of p and only assumes that impact parameter is intrinsically uniformly distributed. This result is driven by larger planets having (i) a longer transit duration and (ii) a higher geometric transit probability. Excluding grazing events (i.e. assuming b &lt; 1 − p) leads to a non-monotonic form for the bias with respect to p. These results highlight the importance of correctly accounting for observational biases in statistical calculations seeking to infer the true planetary radius distribution.</p><p>match. Indeed, setting β = γ and applying a least squares fit for β yields β = 2. Adopting this value, we therefore use the following approximate expression for λ (plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. A1</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_126">f λ [x] = x 2 (1 − log 4 x 2 ).<label>(A7)</label></formula><p>This paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>=(∂ I out S) 2 σ 2 I out + (∂ I in S) 2 σ 2 I in , = I out 2 σ 2 I in + I in 2 σ 2 I out I out 4 .</figDesc></figure>
