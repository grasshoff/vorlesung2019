				<p>The Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are deviations of the measured mid-transit times from the exact periodicity. One of the most interesting causes of TTVs is the gravitational interaction between planets. Here we consider a case of two planets in a mean motion resonance (orbital periods in a ratio of small integers). This case is important because the resonant interaction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more easily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small orbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms. We find that a resonant system should show TTV terms with two basic periods (and their harmonics). The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M *) −2/3 , where m and M * are the planetary and stellar masses. For m = 10 −4 M * , for example, the TTV period exceeds the orbital period by ∼2 orders of magnitude. The amplitude of the resonant TTV terms scales linearly with the libration amplitude. The ratio of the TTV amplitudes of two resonant planets is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. These and other relationships discussed in the main text can be used to aid the interpretation of TTV observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Photometric observation of transits is one of the most powerful methods of planet detection. This method relies on a possibility that, if the planet's orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, the planet may repeatedly transit over the disk of its host star and periodically block a small fraction of the starlight. Thus, by monitoring the host star's brightness, the planet's presence can be revealed by a small dip in the photometric lightcurve. The main properties of the planet, such as its physical radius and orbital period, can be inferred from transit observations.</p><p>The spacing of transit lightcurves would be exactly the same over the course of observations if a planet moved on a strictly Keplerian orbit. Several dynamical effects, however, can produce deviations from the Keplerian case and induce the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). TTVs were originally proposed as a non-transiting planet detection method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miralda-Escudé 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">, Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">, Holman &amp; Murray 2005</ref>, but have found more use in validating the transiting planet candidates from NASA's Kepler mission (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Holman et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lissauer et al. 2011</ref>). Only a handful of non-transiting planets have been so far detected and characterized from TTVs (e.g., Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nesvorn´y et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nesvorn´y et al. , 2013</ref>.</p><p>A significant progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of various dynamical causes of TTVs. These efforts were pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heyl &amp; Gladman (2007)</ref> focused on a long-period interaction between planets and showed that the apsidal precession of their orbits can be detected only with a long TTV baseline. <ref type="bibr">Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y &amp; Mor- bidelli (2008)</ref>, on the other hand, developed a general analytic model for short-period TTVs and showed that they can be used, under ideal circumstances, to uniquely determine the mass and orbital parameters of the interacting planets.</p><p>Explicit analytic formulas for short-period TTVs are now available for zeroth-( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Deck &amp; Agol 2015</ref> and first-order terms ) in planetary eccentricities. The important case of near-resonant TTVs was highlighted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lithwick et al. (2012)</ref> for the first-order resonances and in  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hadden &amp; Lithwick (2016)</ref> for the second-order resonances. The near-resonant TTV signal is a special case of the short-periodic variations when one harmonic becomes amplified due to a proximity of the system to a mean motion resonance.  considered a case of co-orbital planets and showed that co-orbital TTVs are expected to have a characteristic saw-tooth profile (for horseshoe orbits).</p><p>While the analytic works cited above cover a wide range of dynamically plausible planetary configurations, none of them (except for <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref>) considered the case of a fully resonant planetary system, where two (or more) orbits are inside a mean motion resonance (e.g., 2:1, 3:2). This case is important because planetary migration in a protoplanetary gas disk should bring early planets into resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Masset &amp; Snellgrove 2001)</ref>. Indeed, many known planetary systems are consistent with having resonant orbits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Winn &amp; Fabrycky 2015)</ref>. This motivates us to consider the resonant case. Our main goal is to under-stand how resonant TTVs arise, and how their period and amplitude scale with planetary parameters.</p><p>The resonant case has not received much attention in the TTV literature so far at least in part because the resonant interaction of planets is complex and not easily amenable to analytic calculations. The short-periodic or near-resonant TTV signals, for example, can be computed with the standard methods of perturbation theory, where the unperturbed (Keplerian) motion is inserted in the right-hand side of the dynamical equations, and a linear variation of the orbital elements is obtained by quadrature. This method fails for the fully resonant orbits mainly because the resonant dynamics is non-linear.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of recent advances in the theoretical understanding of resonant dynamics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Batygin &amp; Morbidelli 2013a</ref>; hereafter BM13) and derive approximate formulas for TTVs of a resonant pair of exoplanets. In Section 2, we first give a summary of resonant TTVs. The goal of this section is to highlight the main results of this work. Sections 3 and 4 explain how we obtained these results. We first show how a fully analytic solution can be obtained for a first-order resonance (Section 3). We then proceed to expand the exact solution in the Fourier series and explicitly derive the periods and amplitudes of the leading TTV terms (Section 4). The application of these results to real planetary systems is left for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Summary of Resonant TTVs</head><p>Consider a planar system of two planets with masses m 1 and m 2 orbiting a central star with mass M * . The two planets gravitationally interact to produce TTVs. The TTVs signal of the two planets, δt 1 and δt 2 , can be approximated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δt j = 1 n j (−δλ j + 2δh j ) + O(e j ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where n j is the mean orbital frequency of planet j, h j = e j sin ̟ j , λ j is the mean longitude, e j is eccentricity, and ̟ j is the longitude of periapsis. Observer is assumed to see the system edge-on and measures angles λ j and ̟ j relative to the line of sight. Expression (1) is valid for small orbital eccentricities and small variations of the orbital elements, δλ j and δh j (Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y 2009).</p><p>Here we consider a case with two planets in a first-order mean motion resonance (such that n 1 /n 2 ≃ k/(k − 1) with integer k), and proceed by calculating the variations of orbital elements due to the resonant interaction (Sections 3 and 4). The final expressions are given as the Fourier series with harmonics of two basic frequencies. As for δλ j we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">− 1 n 1 δλ 1 = 3(k − 1) Λ 1 ν P τ 2π A Ψ (1 + ǫ) sin f t − ǫ 4 sin 2f t , − 1 n 2 δλ 2 = − 3k Λ 2 ν P τ 2π A Ψ (1 + ǫ) sin f t − ǫ 4 sin 2f t .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Here,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ν = (3/2)[(k−1) 2 n 1 /Λ 1 +k 2 n 2 /Λ 2 ], Λ j = m j GM * a j , a j</formula><p>is the semimajor axis, G is the gravitational constant, P τ is the period of resonant librations in scaled time units (P τ ∼ 2-4 in the most cases of interest; Section 3.7), A Ψ is the amplitude of the resonant oscillations of action Ψ (ranging from zero for an exact resonance to &gt;1, where the approximation used to derive Eq. (2) starts to break down), f is the frequency of resonant librations, and 0 ≤ ǫ &lt; 1 encapsulates the emergence of higher-order harmonics of f . 1</p><p>The resonant frequency f is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f = (νC 2 ) 1/3 2π P τ ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C = Gm 1 m 2 a 2 f 2 1 Λ 1 + f 2 2 Λ 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where f 1 and f 2 are the resonant coefficients of the Laplacian expansion of the perturbing function <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. The scaling of the resonant period, P = 2π/f , with different planetary parameters is discussed in Section 3.7. For practical reasons, Eq. (2) have been truncated at the first order in ǫ. Higher orders in ǫ and higher harmonics of the libration frequency can be computed using the methods described in Section 4.</p><p>The second term in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> is related to the variation of eccentricities and apsidal longitudes of the two planets. In the most basic approximation (Section 4.3), it can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 n 1 δh 1 = P 1 η − 1 3 1 π √ Λ 1 AA Ψ √ A 2 + B 2 C u,0 sin(θ 0 + f θ t) , 2 n 2 δh 2 = P 2 η − 1 3 1 π √ Λ 2 BA Ψ √ A 2 + B 2 C u,0 sin(θ 0 + f θ t) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where P j = 2π/n j are the orbital periods, θ 0 is the initial value of θ = kλ 2 − (k − 1)λ 1 , f θ is the frequency of θ defined in Eq. (65). In the libration regime, f θ ≪ f . The resonant TTVs can therefore be understood as a sum of librational variations given in Eq. (2) and slower modulation of the TTV signal given in Eq. (5). In Eq. (5), C u,0 is a coefficient of the order of unity (Eq. (67) in Section 4.3). For small libration amplitudes, A Ψ C u,0 ≃ √ 2Ψ 0 , where Ψ 0 is the initial value of the resonant action Ψ defined in Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(21)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. This means that, unlike in Eq. (2), TTVs from the variation of eccentricities and apsidal longitudes do not vanish when A Ψ = 0. The dependence of the TTV amplitude on planetary masses arises from A, B and η 1 in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(5)</ref>, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A = f 1 / √ Λ 1 , B = f 2 / √ Λ 2 , and η 1 = ν/C.</formula><p>Two main approximations were adopted to derive Eqs. (2) and (5). In the first approximation, we retained the lowest-order eccentricity terms in the resonant interaction of planets. In the second approximation, we assumed that the libration amplitudes are not very large, and expanded the exact solution in the Fourier series. Both these approximations are tested in Section 5. Here we just illustrate the validity of the Fourier expansion for small libration amplitudes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figures 1 and 2</ref>).</p><p>Let us briefly consider an application of our results to the TTV analysis. We assume that the photometric transits are detected for planets 1 and 2, and that the orbital periods inferred from the transit ephemeris are such that orbital period ratio P 2 /P 1 ≃ k/(k − 1) with small integer k (indicating near-resonant or resonant orbits). Furthermore, TTVs are assumed to be detected for both planets. To be specific, let us consider a realistic case with the available TTV data spanning several years of observations, which is not long enough to resolve the frequencies related to the apsidal precession of orbits.</p><p>The first step of the TTV analysis is to apply the Fourier analysis to the TTV data. This may reveal that the TTV signal contains a basic period. In principle, this period can be one of following two periods: (1) the super period defined as P s = (k/P 2 − (k − 1)/P 1 ) −1 (e.g, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lithwick et al. 2012</ref>), or (2) the resonant libration period P = 2π/f with f defined in Eq. (3). In the first case, the system is not in the libration regime of the resonance and TTVs can therefore be interpreted using the expressions appropriate for the near-resonant dynamics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lithwick et al. 2012</ref>. The results described in this work apply in the second case. Section 3.7 explains how the libration period can be used to constrain planetary masses. Specifically, P ∝ (m/M * ) −2/3 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, Holman et al. 2010</ref>, and therefore larger planetary masses imply shorter TTV periods. For the 2:1 resonance with P 1 = 10 days and m 1 ≃ m 2 = 10 −4 M * , for example, the libration period is P ≃ 4.5 yr (Section 3.7).</p><p>In the next step, it can be useful to check if the Fourier analysis of the TTV data provides evidence for harmonics of the basic period. If that's the case, this can indicate that the libration amplitude is relatively large. A comparison of the amplitudes of different harmonics can then be used to constrain the parameter ǫ in Eq. (2), which is related to the libration amplitude via equations reported in Appendix A.</p><p>We then proceed by comparing the TTV amplitudes of the two planets. From Eq.</p><p>(2) we have that δλ 1 /δλ 2 ≃ −[(k − 1)/k] 2/3 m 2 /m 1 . The TTV amplitude ratio therefore constrains the ratio of planetary masses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agol et al. 2005</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows how the TTV amplitudes depend on planetary masses. For m 1 ≪ m 2 , we obtain from Eq. (2) that the TTV amplitudes of the inner and outer planets, A 1 and A 2 , are</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">A 1 = P 1 2π P τ π A Ψ k − 1 , A 2 = P 2 2π P τ π √ αA Ψ k − 1 m 1 m 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where we denoted α = a 1 /a 2 . This means that the TTV amplitude of the inner planet is independent of masses, while that of the outer planet constrains m 1 /m 2 . For P 1 = 10 day, P τ = 3 and A Ψ = 1, A 1 = 1.52/(k − 1) days for a k:(k − 1) resonance. A similar analysis can be performed for m 1 ≫ m 2 .</p><p>In addition to the dependence on masses, the TTV amplitudes (linearly) depend on the libration amplitude A Ψ . We therefore expect that some degeneracy should exist between the planetary mass and libration amplitude, with large TTV amplitudes being produced either by large masses or large libration amplitudes. This degeneracy can be broken if the libration frequency harmonics are detected, providing constraints on the libration amplitude, or if the measured TTV signal also contains short-period (chopping) terms (e.g., Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nesvorn´y et al. 2013)</ref>. A detailed analysis of this problem is left for future work.</p></div>

Our approach closely follows the work of BM13. We take several shortcuts to simplify the reduction of the Hamiltonian to an integrable system.

The f θ frequency therefore scales in the same manner with planetary parameters as f = η factor).

This factor is ≪ 1 (compare the dotted and solid 'stable 1' lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4)</ref>.

Note that P θ , at least in the approximation adopted here, is independent of the libration amplitude. Also, given that δ − Ψ eq &lt; 0 in the libration island, the f θ frequency is negative as well, meaning that the circulation of θ is retrograde (implying retrograde rotation of ̟ 1 and ̟ 2 ).</p><p>The terms in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The Domain of Validity</head><p>We adopted several approximations in this work:</p><p>I. The Laplacian expansion of the perturbing function used in Section 3.1 is convergent only if the planetary eccentricities are small enough (Sundman 1912). For a planet on a circular orbit, this limits the validity of the expansion to e &lt; 0.25 (e &lt; 0.2) for orbits near its inner (outer) 2:1 resonance, and to e &lt; 0.15 (e &lt; 0.12) for orbits near its inner (outer) 3:2 resonance. The analytic results derived here are not valid above these limits. See Nesvorn´y <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nesvorn´y &amp; Morbidelli (2008)</ref> for a discussion of Sundman's criterion.</p><p>II. All non-resonant terms were neglected in Section 3.1. The short-periodic terms with non-resonant frequencies produce short-periodic TTVs that can be calculated by the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y &amp; Morbidelli (2008)</ref>. These terms can be linearly added to the expressions obtained here for resonant TTVs. The secular terms are second and higher orders in planetary eccentricities and contribute by only a small correction to the precession of orbits if the eccentricities are small.</p><p>III. The second-and higher-order resonant terms in planetary eccentricities were neglected in the perturbing function. This is an important approximation that limits the validity of the results to small eccentricities. The same assumption was adopted when writing δt j as a variation of orbital elements.</p><p>IV. The amplitude of the semimajor axis variations was assumed to be small (this allowed us to simplify the Keplerian Hamiltonian in Section 3.3). The same assumption was adopted to compute δt j from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>, where we also neglected all second and higher order terms in small variations of the orbital elements. We find that these approximations are generally valid and do not impose any meaningful limits on the range of planetary parameters where our analytic results are valid.</p><p>V. The exact solution of the second fundamental model of resonance was expanded in the Taylor series in ǫ and only the terms O(ǫ) were retained (Section 4.1). In addition, the Jacobi elliptic functions were written as the Fourier series and only the lowest harmonics were retained. Both these approximations limit the validity of our analytic TTV model to relatively small libration amplitudes. [In principle, the methods described in Section 4 can be used to obtain more general expressions.]</p><p>Here we perform tests of these assumptions to establish the domain of validity of our analytic model. To this end we developed several codes that compute the resonant TTV signal at various stages of approximation. They are:</p><p>A. A full N-body integrator of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(8)</ref> where the gravitational interaction of planets is taken into account exactly. We used the symplectic code known as Swift ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Levison &amp; Duncan 1994)</ref> with routines for an efficient and precise determination of TTVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nesvorn´yNesvorn´y et al. 2013</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deck et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>B. A numerical integrator in orbital elements that uses the Laplacian expansion of the perturbing function. Various terms can be included or excluded in this integrator. In the most basic approximation, the code includes only the first-order resonant terms from Eq. (10). Optionally, it also accounts for the second-order secular and/or resonant terms. This code is used to test the approximations II and III listed above C. A code that maps the initial orbital elements onto <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref> and numerically integrates the corresponding Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(25)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(26)</ref>. Another code uses the exact analytic solution (31). As expected, these two codes give exactly the same result, which shows that our implementation of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(31)</ref> is working correctly.</p><p>D. A TTV code based on the analytic formulas derived in Section 4. This code is subject to all approximations discussed above. It cannot produce accurate results if the orbital eccentricities and/or libration amplitudes exceed certain limits.</p><p>We first test the approximation V. To this end we compare the results obtained with code B with the analytic results from method D. In B, we include the two first-order resonant terms and neglect terms that are the second or higher order in planetary eccentricities. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The masses and initial orbits are chosen such that δ = 2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 13)</ref> or δ = 4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 14)</ref>. The initial orbits are then varied to survey different libration amplitudes. These tests show that the analytic method produces very reliable results for A Ψ 1 (top panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figs. 13 and 14)</ref>. For the libration amplitudes much larger than that, our analytic expressions for u 1 and v 1 in Eq. (66) become inaccurate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 12</ref>). As a consequence, the analytic approximation of the TTV terms from δh j fails (bottom panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figs. 13 and 14)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, however, the analytic approximation of the full TTV signal is reasonable even if A Ψ &gt; 1. This happens because the TTV terms from δλ j increase with A Ψ and become dominant for large A Ψ . We are able to reproduce these terms correctly, because the analytic formula in Eq. (2) has more a general validity than the one that requires a correct approximation of the boomerang-shaped trajectories in the (u 1 , v 1 ) plane (Eq. 66). We therefore conclude that the analytic TTV model can be used, with some caution, even if the libration amplitudes are relatively large.</p><p>We now turn our attention to the approximations I, II and III. We find that the omission of the higher-order resonant terms in III is the most restrictive assumption. To illustrate this, Figures 15 (inner planet) and 16 (outer planet) show a comparison of the analytic model with TTVs computed from the N-body code (method A above). Here we set different planetary eccentricities ranging from e 1 = e 2 = 0.001 (left panels in both figures) to e 1 = e 2 = 0.05 (right panels). We find that that the analytic model works well for e 1 = e 2 = 0.001.</p><p>Already for e 1 = e 2 = 0.01, a significant discrepancy appears (see middle panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figs.  15 and 16</ref>). An important part of the discrepancy, however, is not due to the assumption III, but is rather related to the choice of initial conditions. Recall that, in addition to the resonant terms, the exact computation of TTVs with method A also contains the short-periodic harmonics, while the analytic method D does not account for these terms. This presents a difficulty when choosing the initial conditions in A and D that are consistent with each other. If the same values are adopted in A and D, the initial semimajor axes in A generate slightly different values of the mean orbital frequencies than the same initial semimajor axes in D. This effect then propagates into a difference in the libration frequency f . To demostrate this, we surveyed a small neigborhood of the initial conditions and found that it is always possible, if the eccentricities are sufficiently small, to apply a small adjustment such that the difference between the analytical and numerical results vanishes (left and middle bottom panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figs. 15 and 16</ref>). Note that this initial value problem does not seriously limit the application of the analytic model to the real data, because it requires only a very small adjustment of a 1 or a 2 (or equivalently n 1 and n 2 ), which can easily be absorbed by other parameters.</p><p>Another more fundamental discrepancy appears for e 1 = e 2 = 0.05. In this case, the TTV frequency computed from the analytic model is nearly 40% higher than the actual frequency, and the TTV amplitudes are ≃25% smaller than their actual values (right panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figs. 15 and 16</ref>). In this case, it is not possible to adjust the initial conditions to cancel the difference. This shows that the assumption III starts to fail. We confirm this by method B, where it becomes apparent that including the second-order resonant terms improves model's precision. Still, for e 1 = e 2 = 0.05 the amplitude discrepancy is relatively minor and can be compensated, for example, by a relatively small correction of planetary masses. We therefore find that the analytic model is still useful in this case. Our additional tests show that the analytic expressions for TTVs are not reliable for eccentricities exceeding ∼0.1. [The validity domain in e should be slightly larger for distant resonances such as 2:1, and smaller for k ≥ 4.]</p><p>The analytic model was developed under the assumption of exactly co-planar planetary orbits. This assumption was used in Section 3.1 to neglect all terms in the Laplacian expansion of the perturbing function that depend on inclinations. The model is therefore not expected to be valid if the mutual inclination between orbits, I mutual , is large. We performed various tests of this assumption and found that the analytic model is reasonably accurate for I mutual &lt; 10 • , but fails to produce reliable results for I mutual 10 • . This should not be a severe limitation of the applicability of the analytic results to the multi-transiting planetary systems, because the orbits in these systems are expected to be nearly co-planar (e.g, Fang &amp; Margot 2012).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>In this work we developed an analytic model for TTVs of a pair of resonant planets, and discussed how the TTV period and amplitude constrain the masses and orbits of the two planets. The model is strictly valid only for small orbital eccentricities (e &lt; 0.1). It was developed under the assumption of co-planar orbits but our tests show that it is valid even if the mutual inclination of orbits is not large (&lt; 10 • ).</p><p>The resonant TTV signal is expected to contain the harmonics of two basic periods: the period of resonant librations and the period of apsidal precession of orbits. The latter is expected to be ∼5 times longer than the former, and may be difficult to detect with a short baseline of the TTV measurements. The libration period is relatively insensitive to the exact location of the system parameters in the resonant island, and scales with (m/M * ) −2/3 . Its determination from the TTV measurements can therefore help to constrain the planetary masses. This is an important difference with respect to the near-resonant case ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lithwick et al. 2012)</ref>, where the TTV period is the super period, which is independent of mass.</p><p>The TTV amplitudes, on the other hand, can be used to constrain the ratio of planetary masses m 1 /m 2 . Since both the TTV period and amplitude depend on the resonant amplitude A Ψ , some mild degeneracies between the mass and orbital parameters are expected, but these degeneracies can be broken by a detection of higher-order resonant harmonics, which constrain A Ψ , and/or short-periodic (chopping) effects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Expressions for Y j</head><p>In Section 3 we omitted to explain one important issue that becomes apparent if the degree of freedom related to θ = kλ 2 − (k − 1)λ 1 is treated separately from those related to ̟ 1 and ̟ 2 (as it was done in BM13). To explain this issue we first define in direct correspondence to Eq.

When substituted into (B4), we obtain Eq. (51) in the main text. In addition, it can be shown that dζ 2 /dt = dφ 2 /dt − dθ/dt = 0. The angle ζ 2 is therefore constant. Consequently, since Φ 2 = const. as well, both U 2 and V 2 are constants of motion. This result is used in Section 4, where V 2 in Eq. (51) does not contribute to TTVs.</p></div>

The coefficient values are given for α = a 1 /a 2 = α res . <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-A demonstration of the validity of the analytic TTV formulas obtained in this work. Here we set m 1 = m 2 = 10 −5 M * with M * = M Sun . The initial orbital elements were a 1 = 0.1 AU, a 2 = 0.13115 AU, e 1 = e 2 = 0.02, λ 1 = π, λ 2 = 0, ̟ 1 = 0, ̟ 2 = π. This orbital configuration corresponds to the libration regime in the 3:2 resonance (k = 3). The upper (lower) panel shows the results for the inner (outer) planet. The green and blue lines were computed by numerically integrating the differential equations corresponding to the resonant Hamiltonian (9) and (10). The black lines were obtained from the analytic TTV expressions (1), (2) and a generalization of (5) derived in Section 4.3. From left to right the panels show TTVs from δλ j and δh j , and their sum from Eq. (1). The validity of the analytic model is excellent in this case because the resonant amplitude is relatively small (A Ψ ≃ 0.65 with δ = 2.36 and Ψ 0 = 3.01; see Section 3).    <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. The solid line denoted 'stable 1' is the first stable equilibrium that exists for any value of δ. The second stable equilibrium, denoted by 'stable 2', appears only for δ &gt; δ * ≃ 0.945. The dashed line is the unstable equilibrium. The gray area is the place where the resonant librations occur. The dynamical regime where the two orbits are just wide (narrow) of the resonance is labeled by α &lt; α res (α &gt; α res ). The dotted line is an approximation of the first equilibrium point, Ψ eq = δ, that becomes progressively better with increasing δ.    Here we assumed that P 1 = 10 days and P τ = 3 and computed P t = (νC 2 ) −1/3 P τ . Panels (a) and (b) show the results for the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances, respectively. This is the expected TTV period produced by the resonant librations in these resonances. The dashed lines show the approximation from Eq. (40), which becomes better for larger values of k (i.e., for α → 1). <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>.-The validity domain of the L12 model. Here we assumed m 1 ≃ m 2 = m and small orbital eccentricities, and plotted the isolines of δ from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref> as a function of planetary mass and P 2 /P 1 − k/(k − 1). According to the discussion in the main text, the L12 model is valid for δ −2. This condition represents a combined constraint on the orbital period ratio and planetary masses. The parameter region below and to the right of the δ = −2 line is where L12's TTV formula is strictly valid. This region covers most of the period range shown here for planetary masses below that of Saturn.  . The approximation is good for small libration amplitudes (inner curves) and degrades when the amplitude increases (outer curve). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 13</ref>.-Tests of the validity of the analytic model for different libration amplitudes. The planetary masses and orbital parameters were chosen such that δ = 2 in all cases shown here. We fixed m 1 = m 2 = 3 × 10 −4 M * , M * = 1 M Sun , a 1 = 0.1 AU, and varied a 2 near the external 3:2 resonance with the inner planet (a 2 ≃ 0.131 AU). The eccentricities were adjusted to give δ = 2 and a desired initial value Ψ 0 . From top to bottom, the panels show the results for Ψ 0 = 2, Ψ 0 = 2.5 and Ψ 0 = 3.5. The stable equilibrium point is located at Ψ eq = 2.24 for δ = 2. The different cases shown here thus correspond to the libration amplitudes A Ψ = 0.25, 1.24 and 1.74 (from top to bottom). The plots show TTVs of the inner planet (the results for the outer planet are similar).

Higher values of δ lead to smaller values of ǫ. For δ ≃ 1, on the other hand, ǫ can be as large as 0.6 near the separatrix.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> Ideally, it would be useful to give the resonant TTV formulas in terms of the orbital elements, but these expressions are excessively complex. Here we therefore opt for expressing TTVs in terms of the orbital elements, and A Ψ and P τ . The dependence on A Ψ is linear and P τ admits only a narrow range of values in the libration zone.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> A general result can also be obtained by directly performing the Taylor expansion in Λ j = Λ * j + δΛ j .</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> It is more common in this context to use ( √ 2Ψ cos ψ, √ 2Ψ sin ψ), because these variables are canonical.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> Inside the resonant island, n s is small and δ is controlled by the contribution from Φ 2 . Since Φ 2 ∝ e 2 , δ is a measure of the orbital eccentricities inside the libration island.</note>

The case with e 1 = e 2 = 0.01 (middle panels) corresponds to δ = 1.25 and Ψ 0 = 0.75. The case with e 1 = e 2 = 0.05 corresponds to δ = 19.3 and Ψ 0 = 18.8. In the two bottom panels on the left, we illustrate how a small adjustment of the initial conditions improves the results (see the main text for a discussion). In the bottom-right panel, we rescaled time to show that a modest adjustment of the frequency can resolve the discrepancy when eccentricities are larger</note>
