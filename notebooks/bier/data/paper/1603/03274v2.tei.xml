				<p>Context. Wide binaries are a potential pathway for the formation of hot Jupiters. The binary fraction among host stars is an important discriminator between competing formation theories, but has not been well characterised. Additionally, contaminating light from unresolved stars can significantly affect the accuracy of photometric and spectroscopic measurements in studies of transiting exoplanets. Aims. We observed 101 transiting exoplanet host systems in the Southern hemisphere in order to create a homogeneous catalogue of both bound companion stars and contaminating background stars, in an area of the sky where transiting exoplanetary systems have not been systematically searched for stellar companions. We investigate the binary fraction among the host stars in order to test theories for the formation of hot Jupiters. Methods. Lucky imaging observations from the Two Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla were used to search for previously unresolved stars at small angular separations. The separations and relative magnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to 10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how likely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide measurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcseconds of our sample of 101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcseconds of a host star, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these. Calibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour Instrument are presented. Conclusions. We find that the overall multiplicity rate of the host stars is 38 +17 −13 %, consistent with the rate among solar-type stars in our sensitivity range, suggesting that planet formation does not preferentially occur in long period binaries compared to a random sample of field stars. Long period stellar companions (P &gt; 10 yr) appear to occur independently of short period companions, and so the population of close-in stellar companions is unconstrained by our study.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The discovery and observation of exoplanets has posed many questions about how planets are formed. One group of planets in particular, the hot Jupiters, has been the subject of intense study -these planets are gas giants with masses similar to Jupiter, but are found orbiting their host stars at fractions of an au, much closer than the gas giants in our own Solar System. Their orbits do not fit in with planet formation distances predicted by the core accretion model, which states that gas giants should form in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disc, with frozen volatiles being vital to their formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Pollack et al. 1996</ref>). The inner limit for the condensation of ices in the disc is 4-5 au for Solar-type stars It is now widely believed that hot Jupiters initially formed far from their host stars, as predicted by the core accretion model, and have since migrated inwards -see the recent reviews on planet-disc interactions by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baruteau et al. (2014)</ref>, and on long term dynamical processes by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Davies et al. (2014)</ref>. Initial work focused on interactions with the protoplanetary disc, causing the planet to lose angular momentum and spiral inwards towards the star. This migration would then be stopped by the planet reaching the inner edge of the disc, or alternatively by tidal interactions between the planet and its host star. This process would result in a well-circularised orbit with a period of only a few days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lin et al. 1996</ref>). However, the simple disc migration theory fails to explain the number of hot Jupiters in eccentric orbits <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Wu &amp; Murray 2003)</ref>, or those with orbits that are A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. hitepAccepted_20160309 retrograde or misaligned compared to the rotation of their host stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Wu &amp; Murray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007)</ref>. Whilst misaligned protoplanetary discs provide a possible pathway for this (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bate et al. 2010)</ref>, observational studies have found that discs are generally well aligned to their host stars, as are the planets within the discs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Watson et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greaves et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Gravitational interactions with a third body can also cause changes in a planet's orbit. Outer planets can cause planet-planet scattering events <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rasio &amp; Ford 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Chatterjee et al. 2008</ref>), whilst inclined planetary or stellar companions can force the inner planet to undergo Kozai-Lidov oscillations, in which it is forced through alternating phases of high eccentricity and high inclination <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Wu &amp; Murray 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Fabrycky &amp; Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naoz et al. 2011</ref>). These pathways are able to explain eccentric and misaligned hot Jupiters, but require a population of outer companions. Hot Jupiters rarely have nearby planetary companions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Steffen et al. 2012</ref>), and so if gravitational interactions are the main origin of such planets, many systems would have to be wide stellar binaries. The host stars are generally Sun-like FGK dwarfs, which have a multiplicity rate of 44±2% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raghavan et al. 2010</ref>), but the binary distribution among known hot Jupiter host stars is very likely to be different. Close binaries are selected against in planet-hunting surveys, due to the difficulty of detecting and characterising a planet in such a system. Additionally, there is evidence that close binaries inhibit planet formation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fragner et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Roell et al. 2012</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wang et al. 2014</ref>). However, if gravitational interactions with a distant binary companion are a common migration pathway it would be expected that the binary fraction would be significantly enhanced.</p><p>To date, several studies have attempted to estimate the multiplicity rate among exoplanet host stars, but the results have been wildly disparate. At the low end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Roell et al. (2012)</ref> reported that as few as 12% of hot Jupiters may be in multiple systems; in contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ngo et al. (2015)</ref> estimate a binary rate of 51% from direct imaging alone, which is raised even higher when combined with radial velocity results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Knutson et al. (2014)</ref>. However, it is difficult to compare direct imaging surveys, due to differences in sensitivity to companions and the area of the sky searched -it would therefore be advantageous to survey or re-analyse a large number of systems in a homogeneous manner, in order to create a large sample of systems from which patterns and trends can be easily identified.</p><p>Transit searches suffer from a high rate of astrophysical false positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Brown 2003)</ref>, and eclipsing binary (EB) systems have proved to be a troublesome source of transit-like events, with periods and eclipse durations similar to those of hot Jupiters. The depths of the eclipses in these systems are generally much larger than would be expected by a planetary transit, but the observed depth is often reduced due to blends with nearby stars -if an eclipsing binary is blended with another star of equal brightness, the eclipse depths will appear halved. A chance alignment of a bright foreground star and a dim background EB can cause the observed eclipses to be almost impossible to distinguish from real planetary transits, a problem that has plagued many surveys. Blending is especially problematic for surveys looking in the crowded galactic plane, such as the Lupus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bayliss et al. 2009</ref>) and OGLE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Torres et al. 2004</ref>) collaborations, but the problem still exists in more sparsely populated fields, with the WASPSouth survey finding that for every 14 candidates sent for followup, 13 are astrophysical mimics or blends ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hellier et al. 2011</ref>). The large number of planet candidates provided by the Kepler mission has resulted in several systematic searches for contaminating stars using various forms high resolution imaging, which were compared to one another by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lillo-Box et al. (2014)</ref>.</p><p>If a planet does indeed exist, blended light can still cause problems, due to diluted transits leading to incorrect determinations of planetary properties. An extreme case is that of Kepler14b, where both photometric and spectroscopic measurements were affected by a companion star at 0.3 ′′ separation, causing the planetary mass and radius to be underestimated by 10% and 60% respectively if the companion was not taken into account ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Buchhave et al. 2011</ref>). A similar analysis was performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> for the WASP-2, TrES-2 and TrES-4 systems, with the planetary parameters changing by up to 2σ when contaminating light from nearby stars was taken into account.</p><p>In this paper, we present high resolution observations of 101 southern hemisphere systems containing transiting hot Jupiters. These were used to search for nearby stars, either those physically associated with the systems, or background objects that contribute contaminating light. We also present follow-up observations of several previously discovered binary candidates, including analyses of the common proper motion of the candidates where sufficient data are available. The distribution of stars detected in our survey are compared to a statistical model in order to estimate the multiplicity rate among our targets, and this is compared to the rate among solar-type stars, and previous estimations of the multiplicity rate among planet host stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>The observations were carried out between April and September 2014 using the Two Colour Instrument (TCI) at the Danish 1.54m telescope, La Silla, Chile. The TCI is a lucky imager designed for simultaneous two-colour photometry, using Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) detectors. We give a brief summary of the instrument, with a more detailed description available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skottfelt et al. (2015b)</ref>. The light arriving at the instrument is split between the two cameras using a dichroic with a cut-off wavelength of 655nm. A second dichroic sends blue light shortward of 466nm towards a focus system. The TCI is not equipped with filters, and so the light received by each camera is determined solely by the dichroics. The 'visual' camera receives light between 466nm and 655nm, and the 'red' camera receives all light redward of 655nm, with the EMCCD detectors able to detect light out to approximately 1050nm. We denote the two passbands v TCI and r TCI for the visual and red cameras respectively. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, r TCI is comparable to the combination of the SDSS i ′ and z ′ filters, or a Cousins I filter with a wider passband, whilst v TCI has a similar central wavelength to the Johnson V filter but with a significantly different response curve. For both cameras, the detector consists of a 512×512 pixel array with a pixel scale of ∼0.09 arcsec/pixel, giving a 45 ′′ × 45 ′′ field of view.</p><p>All target stars were observed using the red camera on the TCI. When possible, targets were also observed simultaneously with the visual camera, which was undergoing commissioning during the 2014 season. The two detectors were operated at a frame rate of 10 Hz for all observations. The use of a higher frame rate of 30 Hz was investigated, but this resulted in a poorer seeing correction. This was likely caused by the lower signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) for the shorter exposures, which resulted in the reduction pipeline being less able to select good quality frames.</p><p>Our targets were taken from the TEPCat 1 database of wellstudied transiting extrasolar planets (TEPs) as of April 2014. All TEP systems observable from La Silla between April and September 2014 with brightnesses in the range 9 ≤ V ≤ 15 were selected -at the time of observing, this brightness range included all published HAT, HAT-South and WASP systems in the Southern hemisphere. We did not specifically include or exclude any systems based on the existence, or lack of, previously known companions. For most targets, the default electron multiplication gain of 300 e − /photon was used but targets brighter than V = 10.5 required a lower gain of 100 e − /photon, with no changes in gain being made during the observing season for a given star. A typical planetary transit results in a flux change of 1%, which can only be mimicked by a blended eclipsing binary less than 5 magnitudes fainter than the foreground star -a system fainter than this cannot produce an overall flux change of 1%, even if it is completely eclipsed. To allow for such contaminating binaries to be reliably detected, the total exposure time for each target was chosen to give an SNR of 500 for a star 5 magnitudes fainter than the target in the V band, assuming that no contaminating light was diluting the signal from this star (i.e. the fainter star was well separated brighter star). The high target SNR included allowances for the rejection of a high fraction of frames in the lucky imaging process, and for shallower transit depths. In a few cases it was necessary to adjust the exposure time after an initial observation to reach the required sensitivity, with the observations being repeated -however, the initial shorter exposures were still used in our data analysis. Variations in the total exposure time also occurred due to the automatic rejection of bad frames by the TCI pipeline. A summary of observations is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, available electronically at the CDS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">TCI pipeline</head><p>Raw lucky imaging data from the TCI are reduced automatically by the Odin pipeline, which is described fully in Skottfelt et al.  <ref type="bibr">(2015b)</ref>. The reduction pipeline performs the standard steps of bias frame removal and flat field correction, and identifies and corrects for cosmic rays. The individual exposures are then recentred to remove shifts in the target on the detector, and ranked by quality, determined by the intensity of the central pixel relative to those surrounding it. Ten cuts in quality are made, and the exposures in each cut are stacked together and output as a ten-layer FITS cube. This allows a user to select only the best exposures for a high quality image, or instead to use more exposures and hence increase the effective exposure time. The cuts are concentrated towards the extremes of quality, and the percentage boundaries between them are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 90, 98, 99, 100. Therefore, the first cut contains the top 1% of images ranked by quality, the second cut contains the next 1% of images, and so on.</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. hitepAccepted_20160309</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Smearing</head><p>In images taken with the TCI, bright stars show an apparent smearing along the image rows in the opposite direction to the EMCCD readout. It is thought that this is caused by charge transfer inefficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Skottfelt et al. 2015b</ref>), in which a small number of electrons can become trapped at the edges of the EMCCD chip during the electron multiplication phase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bush et al. 2014</ref>). These electrons are released during the readout of later pixels in the same row, artificially increasing the signal in those pixels. Despite the smears being only a small fraction (1%) of the total signal of their origin pixel, they are still bright enough to wash out dim stars. To correct for this effect, we assume that the smear-corrected signal I x, y at column x and row y is related from the measured intensity I ′ x, y as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I x, y = I ′ x, y − k y−1 i=1 I x, i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where k is the fraction of the charge that is trapped from one pixel and later released into another pixel. It is therefore assumed that the fraction of charge that becomes trapped per pixel is fixed, and that this charge is released at a constant rate as each subsequent pixel is read out. We also do not attempt to reassign the trapped signal back to its origin pixel, as this would have no effect on the relative brightness of stars if the same fraction of charge is lost per pixel. As the north/south diffraction spikes from the Danish telescope's secondary mirror supports are parallel to the detector readout direction, the north diffraction spike is significantly brighter than the south spike due to smearing. k was determined by assuming the north/south diffraction spikes visible on the TCI images should be of equal intensity after correction, and this constraint was best satisfied by k = 0.0000177.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Detection Method</head><p>Faint stars located close to the target star run the risk of being lost in the wings of the bright target star's point spread function (PSF). Previous high resolution imaging surveys have often used some variation on PSF fitting to detect such stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ngo et al. 2015</ref>), but this was not effective when applied to the TCI data. The Danish 1.54m Telescope suffers from triangular coma below 1 ′′ , resulting in an asymmetric PSF that is not well matched by analytical models, and the changing observing conditions and stochastic nature of the speckles caused by seeing result in significant variations between the PSFs of stars observed even on the same night. Algorithms such as Starfinder ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Diolaiti et al. 2000)</ref>, which derive an empirical PSF for the image, have been successfully applied to analyse TCI observations of crowded fields without requiring an input PSF model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Skottfelt et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Skottfelt et al. , 2015a</ref>). However, many of our observations have only a single bright star visible, and so there is a potential degeneracy between the case of a bright PSF with a nearby dim PSF, and a single bright PSF with a small aberration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ginski et al. (2012)</ref> suggested a method involving the convolution of each image with a Gaussian of a width larger than the FWHM and then subtracting the "blurred" image from the original image. This is similar to the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) technique, in which an image is convolved with two Gaussians of differing widths that are then subtracted from one another, this technique having been used for purposes such as high-pass filtering and edge detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gonzalez &amp; Woods 2002)</ref>. To implement this, the astronomical images were treated as an ideal image of a set of point-like stars that has already been convolved with a Gaussian, due to effects such as seeing and diffraction. As the product of two Gaussians is another Gaussian, the second convolved image can be generated from the first seeingconvolved image.</p><p>For each image cube from the TCI's red camera, the first 7 quality cuts were loaded as separate images, meaning that the best 90% of exposures were used. The 6th and 7th cuts contain the largest number of exposures, 30% and 40% respectively, allowing the detection of very faint stars despite the lower image quality. The final 3 cuts cover the worst 10% of images, and have neither high resolutions nor long exposure times, and so these cuts were not used.</p><p>Each of the seven images was convolved with a Gaussian of standard deviation 4 pixels (FWHM 11.7 pixels) which was then subtracted from the original image, giving a set of difference images. In order to remove the signal from the target star, the images were divided into a series of annuli with a width of 0.5 pixels, centred on the target star -the sub-pixel width was required to handle the steep gradient in signal around the target. Within each annulus, the mean and standard deviation of the counts per pixel were calculated. A sigma clipping algorithm was used to iteratively discount pixels with counts more than 3σ from the mean, to avoid the mean and standard deviation becoming biased when a bright star was present. Finally, any pixels with a signal more than 1.7σ from the annulus mean were flagged as candidate detections, with all candidates from each of the 7 cuts being compiled into a single detection list. The cut-off value of 1.7σ was found to be the best compromise between reducing the number of real stars (as determined by eye) that were incorrectly rejected, and the increasing rate of false positives with lower cutoffs.</p><p>The combined detections for each observation were checked by eye, mainly to exclude spurious detections caused by the noncircular shape of the PSF. The results from each of our observations of a target were combined, creating a single verified list of candidate companions for each object. Measurements of the properties of the stars were done using a single stacked image using the 7 best quality cuts. Magnitudes relative to the target star were calculated using aperture photometry.</p><p>The separations and position angles for each candidate were measured by selecting a 9x9 pixel array centred on the both the target star and the companion stars, which were then supersampled by a factor of 10. To calculate the position of a star's centre along one axis, the super-sampled image was summed parallel to the other axis, and the peak was chosen as the centre of the star. The accuracy of the position determination was tested using simulated stars, with no improvement being found beyond a super-sampling factor of 10, and was found to be accurate to within 0.5 pixels (0.044 ′′ ) for SNRs as low as 5.</p><p>For 11 candidate companions, accurate aperture photometry was not possible due to their small separation from the target star, usually combined with bad seeing conditions. Luckily, these cases all occurred on images with other well-separated stars suitable for use as PSF references, and the positions and magnitudes were measured using the PSF-fitting DAOPHOT routines in IRAF. It was assumed that the PSF shape was constant across the image, as the field of view was small enough to minimise atmospheric effects, and no variation in PSF shape was visible when images were inspected by eye.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Astrometric calibration</head><p>The pixel scale and detector rotation of the red camera were calibrated using observations of eight globular clusters. Using the stellar positions published in the USNO NOMAD-1 catalogue, an automatic fit to the detector scale and rotation was performed using the Starlink AST package and the GAIA image analysis tool 2 . The uncertainties in the NOMAD-1 catalogue varied depending on the brightness of the cluster and sources used for the data, typically being in the range of 60 to 200 mas for each starhowever, as several dozen stars were used in each fit, the effects of random errors were reduced. Our uncertainties were derived from the scatter between the different fits generated. In order to check for any variations in scale or rotation with sky position or date, the images used for calibration were chosen to cover virtually the entire range of sky positions, and covered a range of dates from 2014-05-07 to 2014-09-21. Additionally, an earlier image from the 2013 season was used as a further check for long term consistency.</p><p>The +y axis was found to be rotated from North by 1.1 ± 0.2 • with a scale of 88.7 ± 0.4 mas/pixel, and the −x axis rotated from East by 1.1 ± 0.3 • at a scale of 88.9 ± 0.5 mas/pixel. From these results, it was assumed that any difference in scale and rotation between the two directions was negligible, and the values were combined to give a rotation of 1.1 ± 0.2 • at a scale of 88.8 ± 0.3 mas/pixel. This was not found to vary with the pointing of the telescope, and no evidence of variation with time was found.</p><p>Astrometric calibration was not performed for the visual camera, as the detector was being commissioned during the summer 2014 observing season ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skottfelt et al. 2015b</ref>). This resulted in the orientation of the camera changing several times. In general, the visual camera images were rotated by approximately +2 • compared to the red camera, and were offset slightly towards the south west.</p></div>

Theoretical predictions of the TCI's colour response curves were presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skottfelt et al.

This agrees fairly well with the measurements of <ref type="bibr">Tüg (1977)</ref> at the La Silla site, which predicts that the relative extinction coefficient of filters centred at 560nm and 860nm would be approximately +0.1 mag/airmass. The spectrum used for the standard star G158-100 in Oke (1990) is cut off redwards of 920nm, causing the flux in the red filter to be underestimated. The star is a G-type subdwarf, with T eff = 4981K, log g = 4.16, and <ref type="bibr">[</ref>  References. (1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hamuy et al.

The result is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>. A similar problem with cut-off spectra occurred in the cases of NGC 7293 and LTT 9491. Due to their high temperatures and relatively featureless spectra, both were fitted as black bodies. NGC 7293 was extended from 900nm onwards with a black body temperature of 110,000K, and LTT 9491 was extended from 970nm onwards with a temperature of 12,500K.</p><p>Upon analysis of the extinction-corrected colour indices, it became apparent that all stars were systematically offset by −0.46 in the (v − r) TCI colour index compared to the predicted values, indicating that the stars appear significantly bluer than expected. This is much larger than the atmospheric extinction correction, and it is not currently clear what the cause of the offset is. There is some evidence that the colour offset is temperature related, with cooler stars generally showing a lower offset, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>.</p></div>

We therefore calculated a set of theoretical colour indices for main sequence dwarf stars of solar metallicity for the EMCCD instrument, using PHOENIX model spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Husser et al. 2013</ref>) and the passband data published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Skottfelt et al.

Instead, it was decided to derive an empirical relation between stellar mass and effective temperature, in order to allow the colour indices to be expressed in terms of mass.</p><p>DEBCat 4 is a catalogue of the physical properties of detached eclipsing binaries. The catalogue only includes systems in which the two stars are well separated, ensuring that their evolution has not been affected by mass transfer. The stars in the catalogue therefore provide a set of measurements that are representative of non-binary stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Southworth 2015)</ref>. However, at higher masses, the catalogue is biased to include a significant proportion of stars that have evolved off the main sequence, due to these being both brighter and more likely to eclipse than unevolved stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Andersen 1991</ref>). Therefore, similar cuts to those used in Southworth (2009) were chosen, with only stars below 1.5M ⊙ included in the fit. Additionally, for systems where both components are above 1.0M ⊙ , only the secondary stars from systems with q = M B M A &lt; 0.9 were used. Assuming that both stars in a binary system are co-evolutionary, a higher mass primary star will evolve off the main sequence first. By choosing only secondary stars that were significantly less massive than the primary stars, the difference in the two components' main sequence lifetimes ensured that even if the primary had begun to evolve, the sec- ondary would still be on the main sequence. For systems where both components were below 1.0M ⊙ , the main sequence lifetimes of both components were assumed to be long enough that neither star was likely to have evolved significantly. The V1174 Ori system was manually excluded despite matching these criteria, as it comprises two pre-main sequence stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Stassun et al. 2004</ref>), which have much larger radii than main sequence stars. Rather than fitting directly to the effective temperature of the star, T eff , we define the variable X = log(T eff ) − 3.6, to increase the numerical accuracy of our fits. The linear fit between X and log (R /R ⊙ ) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, and the cubic fit between X and log (M /M ⊙ ) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. The scatter in the data points is larger than would be expected from the error bars alone, and can be attributed to physical differences between the stars in the dataset, caused by properties such as metallicity or stellar activity which were not considered in this fit. Because of this, the fit was not improved significantly by the inclusion of measurement errors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Host star distances</head><p>To convert between the physical and projected separations of two stars, their distance must be known. A number of different methods have been used in the literature to calculate the distances to TEP host stars, and it is not always clear which method was used. We therefore decided to derive a homogeneous set of distances to the targeted host stars using the K-band surface brightnesseffective temperature relation presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kervella et al. (2004)</ref>. The stellar radius and effective temperature were taken from the TEPCat database of physical properties of transiting exoplanet systems (Southworth 2011), using the data available as of 2015-10-01 <ref type="bibr">5</ref> , with the K band magnitudes derived from 2MASS Ks magnitudes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>). Stars separated by less than 5 ′′ were not consistently detected as two separate stars by the 2MASS data reduction pipeline, and so the K band magnitudes suffer from contaminating light. However, in all cases we find that the candidate companions are faint enough that they contribute only a few percent of the total flux, and are often sufficiently separated for contaminating light to be at a relatively low level. K band extinction was assumed to be negligible for the entire sample. Our derived distances are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, available electronically from the CDS, and are generally within 2σ of the previously reported values.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Common proper motion analysis</head><p>If two stars are gravitationally bound to one another, it is expected that they will display common proper motion. Therefore, the separation and position angle of the companion relative to the planet host star should not change significantly with time, assuming that orbital motion is negligible over the observational baseline. An alternative scenario is that in which the candidate companion is a distant background star, showing negligible proper motion compared to the foreground target star. In this case, it is expected that the foreground star will move past the background star over time. Additionally, the apparent separation and angle between the two stars will vary over the Earth's orbit due to parallax, with the foreground star having a significantly larger parallactic motion. For proper motions, the UCAC4 catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Zacharias et al. 2013</ref>) was chosen as the source for all targets. We compared the data in UCAC4 with that in the NOMAD ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zacharias et al. 2004</ref>) and PPMXL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Roeser et al. 2010</ref>) catalogues. We generally found that all three catalogues agreed on the proper motions to within the errors, although differences were found for CoRoT-3, CoRoT-11, and HAT-P-41 -it is likely that these discrepancies are caused by contamination from the stars detected in this survey, combined with low proper motions. We also investigated the proper motions available in the recently published URAT1 catalogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Zacharias et al. 2015</ref>). We found that the values were often significantly different to the other three catalogues for our targets, even those with high proper motions, and therefore decided not to use the URAT1 data.</p><p>We generated a model describing the relative motion of the two objects assuming that the candidate companion was a distant background star. The expected motion was then calculated using the position of the companion, which was allowed to vary to fit the data, and the UCAC4 proper motion of the target and the parallax expected from the distances derived in Section 3.7. We also created a second model in which the two stars showed no relative motion, and again fitted the initial position of the companion to give the best fit. The two models were compared using the χ 2 goodness of fit, from which the more probable model was identified, and the significance with which it was preferred. The fit comparisons are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 9</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figs. 6 and 7</ref> show the measured separations and position measurements of twelve candidate companions for which other observations are available, as well as the best fits from the proper motion models.</p></div>

No trend is obvious in position angle, although it should be noted that no measurement was provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hartman et al. (2012)</ref>, limiting the observational baseline. We note that the PPMXL and NOMAD catalogues quote significantly different proper motions for HAT-P-41 compared to UCAC4, but these values are also inconsistent with companion 1 either being bound or a stationary background object. One possible explanation for the trend is that the reported companion is a star at a similar or lower distance, exhibiting its own proper motion. Further observations are needed to determine whether or not the trend is real, and if so, its origin.</p></div>

The separation and position angle are similar, but not entirely consistent, with previous results. There appears to have been a trend of reducing separation at a rate of ∼ 7 mas/year over a baseline of seven years, illustrated by a red line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 7</ref>. This corresponds to a transverse motion of approximately 1.1 au/year at WASP-2's distance of 140pc <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Collier Cameron et al. 2007)</ref>, which compares to an upper limit of orbital motion of 1.0 au/year for a 0.85 + 0.39M ⊙ binary, assuming a circular orbit and that the projected separation is the actual separation. However, given that the two stars appear to be moving directly towards one another, the orbit would have to be nearly edge-on, implying that the projected motion would be much less than 1.0 au/year when the two stars appear furthest apart. Increasing the orbital radius increases the part of the motion that would be projected, but reduces orbital velocity, and so such an orbit would never result in a projected motion as large as the observed trend.</p><p>We obtained a position measurement from the adaptive optics images presented in Collier <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cameron et al. (2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(Skillen, priv. comm.)</ref>, with a separation of 0.70±0.03 ′′ and a position angle of 101.8±0.2 • on 6/7 September 2007, which does not visibly support the trend. However, even with this additional data, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of a flat line fitted to the data with no gradient is 638, compared to a BIC of 26 for a line including a linear trend, giving a highly significant ∆BIC = 612. We note that the fit is mainly constrained by three data points: two astrometric measurements from AO observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ngo et al. (2015)</ref>; and a lucky imaging measurement in 2007 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> with a small uncertainty of 0.001 ′′ . This uncertainty is much smaller than those reported for the observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bergfors et al. (2013)</ref> using the same instrument (0.024 ′′ and 0.013 ′′ ). However, refitting after excluding the data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref> still results in a significant result of ∆BIC = 24, and the additional exclusion of the precise data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ngo et al. (2015)</ref> only reduces this slightly to ∆BIC = 19. The fitted trend being in the same direction with a similar magnitude in all cases (4.9 ± 0.3mas/year for all data, 5.4 ± 1.9mas/year excluding data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. (2009)</ref>, and 7.6 ± 3.1mas/year excluding all high precision data).</p><p>We therefore conclude that with the currently available data the trend appears to be real. A chance alignment of the motions of two field stars is statistically unlikely due to the high proper motion of WASP-2 (51.5 mas/year), which would require the two stars to have very similar proper motions for the trend to be so small. Additionally, all previous analyses of the spectral types of the two stars have found them to be consistent with being at the same distance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Daemgen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bergfors et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ngo et al. 2015</ref>), although none have considered that the companion may be a distant red giant star. One possible scenario is that the two stars originated from the same star forming region, which could explain the similar proper motions without requiring that they are bound. Further high-precision astrometric data would be useful in confirming the existence of the trend, whilst spectroscopic observations would be able to provide information on the radial motion of the companion, as well as additional information about its physical properties.</p></div>

The number and projected surface density of stars is given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref>, divided into the three categories. In all categories the density of stars is higher within 5 ′′ than 20 ′′ , as would be expected of a population of bound companions that are more likely to be found at small separations, although the relative increase in density is smaller in the crowded fields, matching the A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. hitepAccepted_20160309 increasing population of background stars.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Multiplicity Rate</head><p>To estimate the fraction of systems with bound companions, we created a model in which the distribution of detected stars is described using two components. The first is a population of unbound field stars uniformly distributed in space, derived from the TRILEGAL galaxy model, v1.6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Girardi et al. 2005</ref>).   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 12</ref>.

Also plotted is the 5σ detection limit of our observations of WASP-7, typical of our data. Note that the sensitivity of some observations was better at low separation (the closest companion, that to WASP-2, was detected in exceptionally good seeing), and that the lower limit on sensitivity at large separations varied with target brightness and atmospheric conditions. the two components were given a distribution approximating the Solar sample, being randomly placed in one of three regimes: low mass ratio (0.00 &lt; q ≤ 0.20, 13.2% chance), intermediate mass ratio (0.20 &lt; q ≤ 0.95, 75% chance), or high mass ratio (0.95 &lt; q ≤ 1.00, 11.8% chance). This means that components with nearly equal mass were more likely, and systems with extreme mass ratios were less likely. The actual values of q were taken from a uniform distribution of values within the chosen regime. It was assumed that the TEP host star was the more massive star in all cases. The mass of the companion was required to be above the canonical brown dwarf limit of 0.08M ⊙ in all cases, as the relations between temperature, mass, and radius derived in Section 3.7 are not valid in the brown dwarf regime. The periods follow a log-normal distribution, with a mean log P of 5.03 (293 years) and standard deviation of 2.28 (covering 1.5-55900 years), P being expressed in days. Periods were restricted to lie above 10 years (log P &gt; 3.56), as a close-in stellar object is likely to have been detected either through radial velocities or by gravitational perturbations of the planet's orbit. Values of eccentricity were uniformly distributed in the range 0.00 ≤ e ≤ 0.95, and all other orbital elements, including the phase at time of observation, were distributed uniformly throughout their entire range. The companion ratio, f c , varies from 0 to 100%, i.e. each system may have up to, but not more than, one physically bound companion. Multiple star systems are often found to be of a hierarchical nature, and we assume that a triple stellar system would be composed of the primary orbited at large separation by a close binary, which we count as a single companion. For each randomly generated companion, its projected separation from the planet host star was calculated using the generated orbital elements and the distance to the planet host stars derived in Section 3.7.</p><p>The companion fraction was determined using a likelihood ratio test, with the null model being the special case of f c = 0 (no bound companions), and the alternative model with a nonzero companion fraction. For each target star, we randomly generated 100,000 systems with bound companions and determined their distribution with projected separation, counting any companion that fell below our sensitivity curve as undetected. To determine the expected number of detected companions for each value of f c , the fraction of the simulated systems with detections was multiplied by f c . Therefore, if 50% of the 100,000 simulated binary systems had a detectable low mass component, and the overall multiplicity fraction f c was set to 10%, we concluded that 5% of stars observed would have a detectable bound companion. The model component consisting of background stars was then added, unmodified by f c .</p><p>From our model, we find an overall companion fraction of 38 +17</p><p>−13 % among all target stars. Using the data for Solar type stars in multiple systems from <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref>, the fraction of systems with a component whose period is above 10 years is 35 ± 2%, consistent with our value. However, a number of long-period systems in the sample of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref> also include closer companions to the primary, and it has been suggested that planet formation is inhibited in close binaries by theoretical models of planet formation (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zhou et al. 2012</ref>). Analysis of the known population of planets has also shown that planets are very rarely found in binaries with separations less than 20 au ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Eggenberger et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wang et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wang et al. , 2015</ref>, with planet frequency being diminished out to binary separations of approximately 100 au <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Desidera &amp; Barbieri 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Roell et al. 2012</ref>). 28% of the systems in the sample of <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raghavan et al. (2010)</ref> have a short period component (P &lt; 10 years). Removing these systems from the sample and leaving only single stars or multiple systems with long period components only, we find that the expected multiplicity rate among the planet-hosting stars would be 36 ± 2%. This value is very similar to the fraction among all systems (35±2%), indicating that the presence of long period stellar companions is nearly independent of the presence of short period components. As a result, it is not possible to infer any details about any potential lack of short period companions from our survey. The fit to the companion fraction is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 9</ref>, with the overall multiplicity rate of 35 ± 2% indicated.</p><p>The consistency of the overall multiplicity rate does not necessarily mean that the distribution of binary properties is the same as the solar sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wang et al.

Our survey is mainly sensitive to companions beyond the 200 au limit, and so an enhanced binary rate at smaller separations would not be detected. Further observations of our target systems capable of probing within this limit, such as imaging assisted by adaptive optics or a search for radial velocity trends, are required to determine how the binary fraction changes with distance. stellar companions, and this survey has since been expanded to cover a total of 31 stars, with 7 potential multiple systems, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bergfors et al.

The majority of these stars are likely to be unbound background objects. Within 5 ′′ , 51 stars were found -due to their smaller separation, these stars are more likely to be physically related to the target stars, and also provide the greatest amount of photometric and spectroscopic contamination.</p><p>For 12 candidate companions with historical observations we present proper motion analyses, and we also provide two band photometry for a subset of the targets. We find that a star located 10 arcseconds from HAT-P-30, recorded as a bound companion in the Washington Double Star Catalog, is likely being a background star. For the close companion to HAT-P-30, and the companions to WASP-8, WASP-70 and WASP-77, we confirm common proper motion. For WASP-2B, we provide a revised separation and position angle for the 2007 observation that better matches later measurements. We find that the two stars in the WASP-2 system appear to be moving together on the sky, but find a statistically significant trend of reducing separation of approximately 0.8 mas/year corresponding to a projected motion of 1 au/year, far above the expected orbital motion. Additionally, no such trend is apparent in position angle, and we are unable to explain the origin of the trend -possible scenarios include a chance alignment of two stars at a similar distance, similar proper motions of two stars originating from the same starforming region, or that the companion is actually a distant red giant star with a high velocity. For the previously reported companion to HAT-P-41, we find evidence that the two stars are moving relative to one another, suggesting that the two stars are not physically related. The remainder of our proper motion analyses are not conclusive, due to low numbers of observations, low proper motions of the target stars, or inconsistent measurements from different groups.</p><p>We test our distribution of candidate companions against a model which includes both physically bound and background stars. By comparing the number and separation of companions against a varying companion fraction, we conclude that hot Jupiter host stars have a multiplicity rate of 38 +17 −13 %, consistent with the fraction of Solar-type stars that have a companion star with an orbital period over 10 years (35±2%). We also investigate the effect of close binaries, which are known to suppress planet formation -many stellar multiple systems are hierarchical, containing both short period and long period components. We find that the expected multiplicity rate if planet formation occurs around only single stars or those in long period binaries A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. hitepAccepted_20160309 is 36±2%, almost indistinguishable from the fraction expected if systems with short period components are included. We therefore conclude that our sample does not show an overabundance of long period companions in the range of 1-40 ′′ , suggesting that planet formation does not preferentially occur in wide stellar binaries. The populations of companions at short and long periods do not appear to be linked, and so we are unable to make any inferences about the presence -or lack of -short period stellar companions. Probing this regime requires powerful imaging techniques such as adaptive optics imaging, with the latest high contrast instruments such as SPHERE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Macintosh et al. 2008</ref>) or GPI ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Beuzit et al. 2008</ref>) being best suited to finding dim stellar companions at distances less than a few tens of au, where the dynamical influence of such companions would be strongest. Alternative techniques sensitive to close-in companions should also be considered, with examples including radial velocity surveys (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>) or spectroscopic searches for unresolved stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Piskorz et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>The results of calibrations for the detector scale and the colour response of the TCI are presented, along with a set of theoretical stellar colour indices. Since late 2014, the TCI has been capable of simultaneous two colour photometry, and multicolour observations of candidate companions allow us to determine whether or not their distance is consistent with that of the target star, providing an efficient way to detect background objects. We analyse the stars for which two colour photometry was available, and find that the bound companions to WASP-8 and WASP-77 are consistent with being at the same distance. We compare the derived effective temperatures for the planet host stars with two colour photometry, and find them generally reliable, but that systematic offsets can be caused by interstellar extinction, for which a correction is not yet available.</p><p>In the future we will obtain new measurements of the separation and position angle of candidate companions, allowing the detection of common proper motion. Two colour photometry will be performed for all future observations, allowing the relative distances to the target and companion stars to be calculated, providing an additional indicator of boundedness. We will also be extending the HITEP campaign to include analyses of several recently published transiting exoplanet systems.</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. hitepAccepted_20160309 </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
