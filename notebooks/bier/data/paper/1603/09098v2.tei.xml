				<p>Context. Observations of exoplanet atmospheres have revealed the presence of cloud particles in their atmospheres. 3D modelling of cloud formation in atmospheres of extrasolar planets coupled to the atmospheric dynamics has long been a challenge. Aims. We investigate the thermo-hydrodynamic properties of cloud formation processes in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter exoplanets. Methods. We simulate the dynamic atmosphere of HD 189733b with a 3D model that couples 3D radiative-hydrodynamics with a kinetic, microphysical mineral cloud formation module designed for RHD/GCM exoplanet atmosphere simulations. Our simulation includes the feedback effects of cloud advection and settling, gas phase element advection and depletion/replenishment and the radiative effects of cloud opacity. We model the cloud particles as a mix of mineral materials which change in size and composition as they travel through atmospheric thermo-chemical environments. All local cloud properties such as number density, grain size and material composition are time-dependently calculated. Gas phase element depletion as a result of cloud formation is included in the model. In-situ effective medium theory and Mie theory is applied to calculate the wavelength dependent opacity of the cloud component. Results. We present a 3D cloud structure of a chemically complex, gaseous atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Mean cloud particle sizes are typically sub-micron (0.01-0.5 µm) at pressures less than 1 bar with hotter equatorial regions containing the smallest grains. Denser cloud structures occur near terminator regions and deeper (∼ 1 bar) atmospheric layers. Silicate materials such as MgSiO 3 [s] are found to be abundant at mid-high latitudes, while TiO 2 [s] and SiO 2 [s] dominate the equatorial regions. Elements involved in the cloud formation can be depleted by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions. The interplay between radiative-hydrodynamics and cloud kinetics leads to an inhomogeneous, wavelength dependent opacity cloud structure with properties differing in longitude, latitude and depth. This suggests that transit spectroscopy would sample a variety of cloud particles properties (sizes, composition, densities).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The detection of atoms and molecules such as Na ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Charbonneau et al. 2002)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">K (Sing et al. 2011a</ref>), H 2 O ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Swain et al. 2009</ref>), CO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Snellen et al. 2010</ref>) and CH 4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Swain et al. 2008</ref>) in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter exoplanets have provided a first glimpse into the chemical composition of these planets. One of the major results of observational efforts is the detection of clouds/hazes in exoplanet atmospheres. Two key signatures of atmospheric cloud in transmission spectra are an almost featureless optical spectrum, interpreted as Rayleigh scattering by cloud particles, and a relatively flat infrared spectrum with weakened molecular signatures. Hubble and Spitzer observations of exoplanets such as HD 189733b ), WASP-31b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Sing et al. 2015</ref>), WASP-6b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nikolov et al. 2015</ref>) and GJ 1214b <ref type="bibr">(Kreid- berg et al. 2014)</ref> show evidence for clouds in their atmosphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Deming et al. (2013)</ref> present detailed HST observations of HD 209458b, and show that the muted spectral H 2 O and Na features can be explained by the additional grey opacity of clouds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sing et al. (2016)</ref>'s study of 10 hot Jupiters, incl. HD 189733b, in their Hubble and Spitzer observing program, provides com-E-mail: gl239@st-andrews.ac.uk pelling evidence that the muted water lines in the infrared can be attributed to high altitude mineral clouds. They show that the signatures of clouds are present across a diverse range of planet equilibrium temperatures (T eq = 960 . . . 2510 K), radii (R pl = 0.96 . . . 1.89 R J ) and mass (M pl = 0.21 . . . 1.40 M J ). Lecavelier Des <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Etangs et al. (2008)</ref> and  have shown that a sub-micron cloud composition of silicate minerals such as MgSiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] can fit the observed Rayleigh slope of HD 189733b. Star spots ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McCullough et al. 2014</ref>) have been discussed as possible explanation for the HD 189733b spectral features. However, this does not rule out the presence of atmospheric cloud. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans et al. (2013)</ref>'s HST analysis of secondary transit observations for HD 189733b show a blueward slope in the geometric albedo at optical wavelengths, suggesting the presence of wavelength dependent backscattering cloud particles.</p><p>In recent years, global circulation models (GCM) and radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) models have been developed in order to understand the global dynamics of extrasolar atmospheres. To date, most groups have focused on modelling the hot Jupiters, HD 189733b (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol 2013)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mayne et al. 2014</ref>) and the warm sub-Neptune GJ 1214b (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kataria et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Charnay et al. 2015a</ref>). Codes differ in their implementation and hydrodynamic assumptions (see summary in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mayne et al. 2014</ref>) and radiative-transfer schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amundsen et al. 2014</ref>) as well as the complexity with which gas and cloud chemistry is implemented. However, the overall global thermal structures and jet patterns remain similar for HD 209458b simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Heng &amp; Showman 2015)</ref>. Hot Jupiter simulations of HD 189733b (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Showman et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol 2013)</ref> have consistently reproduced offsets of maximum temperature to the East of the sub-stellar point, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Knutson et al.

They post-process their simulations and examine the differences in the gas phase chemical equilibrium abundances between each planet. Other simulations have investigated the effect of eccentricity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lewis et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lewis et al. , 2014</ref>), orbital distance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al. 2015</ref>), rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Rauscher &amp; Kempton 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Showman et al. 2015</ref>) and irradiation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Perna et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Komacek &amp; Showman 2016)</ref> on the hydrodynamics of the atmosphere.</p><p>Thus far, investigations of atmospheric cloud properties of hot Jupiters using GCM/RHD simulations have not included a model for describing the formation of clouds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Parmentier et al.

They post-process their GCM to model the optical and infrared wavelength phase curves of <ref type="bibr">Kelper-7b (Demory et al. 2013</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Parmentier et al.

A common feature of the above cloud modelling approaches is the prescription of a constant grain size and homogeneous mineral composition of cloud particles.</p><p>We present the first 3D hot Jupiter RHD model with a coupled kinetic cloud formation, opacity and transport of cloud particles.

(2008)</ref>. Section 2 provides a summary of the RHD model and the cloud formation model. Section 3 outlines our cloud formation approach, numerical approach and a discussion on the present state of convergence. In Sect. 4 we present the 3D temperature and horizontal velocity field and local cloud properties such as cloud number density, local cloud particle sizes, material composition and element depletion. Section 6 presents wavelength dependent cloud, gas and total opacities and examines the stellar heating rates resulting from the cloud opacity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cloud formation model</head><p>On Earth, water clouds are formed when particles made of sand, ash or ocean spray salt are lofted up into atmospheric layers where water vapour is supersaturated. These cloud condensation nuclei or aerosols are the start of the formation of water droplets due to the surface area they provide. Only a small supersaturation ratio (S ∼ 1.001; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Korolev &amp; Mazin 2003</ref>) is required to start water condensation on these surfaces in the Earth's atmosphere. Since no solid crust exists on hot Jupiters, cloud formation has to start from the gas phase by the nucleation of seed particles. Possible seed formation species have been reviewed by <ref type="bibr">Helling &amp; Fomins (2013)</ref> which found TiO 2 to be an efficient nucleating gas species for Brown Dwarf and hot Jupiter atmospheres. TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] is a high-temperature condensate which forms seed particles from a chemical pathway of successive (TiO 2 ) N stable clusters through homogeneous nucleation. Based on the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jeong et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee et al. (2015b)</ref>, we are in the position to apply a modified classical nucleation theory where we use the thermodynamical data for the individual cluster sizes (TiO 2 ) N to derive the seed formation rate dependent on the local gas temperature and gas density, and hence calculate the number of locally formed seed particles. After the first seed particles are nucleated from the gas phase, chemical surface reactions grow the grain bulk. This surface can grow or evaporate while the particles are transported across the globe, depending on the local thermodynamic and chemical conditions. The composition of the grain bulk changes when various materials become thermally stable or unstable. This process results in a solid mantle of mixed mineral composition where the seed particle contributes a negligible amount of volume compared to the total volume of the whole cloud particle. The local growth and evaporation chemical surface processes occur at second-to-minute timescales <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helling et al. 2001</ref>) meaning the properties (size, composition) of the cloud particles adapt quickly to the local gaseous thermodynamic properties.</p><p>To describe the cloud formation process we use the set of dust moment equations derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Woitke &amp; Helling (2003</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Helling &amp; Woitke (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Helling et al. (2008)</ref>. The dust moments L j (r) [cm j g −1 ] ( j = 0, 1, 2, 3) are the local integrated particle size distribution, weighted by a power of the grain volume V j/3 , defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ρ gas L j (r, t) = ∞ V l f (V, r, t)V j/3 dV,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where f (V, r) [cm −6 ] is the distribution of particles in volume space and V l <ref type="bibr">[cm 3</ref> ] the volume of a seed particle.

The local time evolution of cloud properties are represented by the source/sink terms (r.h.s.) describing the seed formation and the grain growth/evaporation chemical processes. The second l.h.s. term denotes the advective flux of the conserved quantity (ρ gas L j ) through space, given by the dust phase hydrodynamic fluid velocity u d (r) [cm s <ref type="bibr">−1 ]</ref>.

Therefore, the cloud formation chemistry (r.h.s. Eq. 11) is integrated every 10 hydrodynamic timesteps to update the local cloud particle properties. The drift velocity v dr (r) and cloud opacity κ b,cloud are updated after the cloud formation chemistry. At every hydrodynamic timestep, cloud moments; L j (r), material volume composition; L 3,s (r) and gaseous element abundances; ε i (r) are advected around the globe by calculation of the advective term in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(22)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, we take a number of physically based assumptions to reduce the number of cloud chemistry iterations required and to ensure physical solutions to the cloud properties. During an evaporation event, the maximum integration step size is reduced by half to capture the evaporation process more consistently. We limit evaporation of grains to the seed particle size (∼0.001 µm); should the integrator attempt to evaporate the moment solutions below seed particle sizes, the end solution is assumed to be at the local seed particle values. At this point, should the seed particles be thermally unstable (χ net TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] (r) &lt; 0 cm s −1 ) then all seed particles are assumed to be evaporated (i.e. L j (r) = 0) and the Ti and O elements returned to the gas phase by <ref type="bibr">Eq. (30)</ref>. This condition is only met at the hottest, deepest parts of the atmosphere (T gas &gt; 2300 K) in our simulations. Thermal stability may prevail to higher gas temperatures if other hightemperature condensates are included.</p><p>We limit the calculation of the dust chemistry to regions where the number density of grains is n d (r) &gt; 10 −10 cm −3 unless the local nucleation rate is J * (r) &gt; 10 −10 cm −3 s −1 . This condition ensures that only regions that are efficiently nucleating or already contain a significant number of cloud particles are integrated. This criteria ensures that deeper atmospheric regions (p gas &gt; 10 bar) which have a negligible nucleation but large growth rate, where a small number of cloud particles grow rapidly large (&gt;1 cm), do not occur. Without this criteria, these regions become computationally challenging as the drift velocity (Eq. 13) becomes large (∼ speed of sound) for these particles. The hydrodynamic Courant-Friedrich-Levi [CFL] timestep condition then limits the hydrodynamic timestep to unfeasibly low values. The cloud opacity and drift velocity in regions which contain very little cloud particles (n d (r) &lt; 10 −10 cm −3 ) are assumed to be zero. For regions where n d (r) &gt; 10 −10 cm −3 , a lower bound cloud opacity of κ cloud = 10 −7 cm 2 g −1 across all wavelength bands is implemented to aid numerical stability. This is required since the results of Mie theory in certain seed particle regions can approach floating point limits. This corresponds to a lower bound of TiO 2 [s] seed particle opacity (κ cloud (λ, a seed ) ≥ 10 −7 cm 2 g −1 ) at optical wavelengths.</p><p>Furthermore, cells with very small growth/evaporation rates of |χ net (r)| &lt; 10 −20 cm s −1 are assumed to remain constant with respect to the dust moments. Only cells which have local conditions that are significant departures from the equilibrium solution (χ net (r) = 0) are integrated in time. We found integrating cells with |χ net (r)| &lt; 10 −20 cm s −1 was computationally prohibitive and did not produce significantly different results.</p><p>The need to only update the r.h.s. of the dust moment equation every 10th hydrodynamic timestep may lead to a fast transport of cloud particles into high temperature regions where they will evaporate. This volatile material would evaporate rapidly at some material dependent "evaporation window" as it passed into these unstable regions. The dust moment and element conservation equations become numerically stiff for such an intense evaporation, hence, the dust moments would approach phase equilibrium (i.e. when evaporation stops) in very small timesteps. Small timesteps for the intense evaporation regions are necessary in order to solve the element conservation equation (Eq. 22) to the best possible precision. To overcome this numerical challenge, we introduce a scheme where, should the integration timestep be too low at the beginning of the cloud chemistry integration, a fraction of the volatile materials are instantly evaporated back into the gas phase. This process is repeated until integration of cloud properties can be computed in a reasonable time. Growing or (near-)stable (|χ s (r)| &gt; 10 −30 cm s −1 ) material are not altered and assumed to remain constant. The return of elements to the gas phase from each evaporation species s due to an instantaneous evaporation event is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Woitke 2006</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">ε i (r) = ε b i (r) + ν s 1.427amu V 0,s ∆L 3,s (r),<label>(30)</label></formula><p>where ε b i (r) is the element abundance before the instant evaporation step, ν i,s the stoichiometric coefficient of element i in species s and 1.427 amu the conversion factor between gaseous mass density ρ gas and Hydrogen nuclei density n H and ∆L 3,s (r) the difference in grain volume of species s before and after instant evaporation.</p><p>This scheme has the added benefit of evenly spreading computational load, since each evaporating cell has a more equal work load.

We therefore study the local gas temperature which will allow us to develop a global picture of the atmospheric temperature of hot Jupiters like HD 189733b under the influence of cloud formation.</p><p>A variation between dayside and nightside is present, with largest gradients in temperatures typically occurring near the terminator regions, most apparent at 0.1, 1 and 10 mbar <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The larger hydrodynamic velocities (super-sonic jet streams) at equatorial regions advects energy density Eastward, resulting in a longitude offset of the temperature maximum by φ ∼ 20-40 • East compared to the sub-stellar point φ = 0 • where the planet receives maximum irradiation from the host star. This is most apparent at 100 mbar and 1 bar in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>. Differences in temperature (&gt;100 K) between equatorial regions and mid-high latitudes are present in upper atmospheric regions. At depths &gt;5 bar the local gas temperature starts to become more uniform in longitude and latitude. Hottest upper atmosphere regions (T gas &gt; 1500 K) occur on the dayside at the peak of the temperature inversions (∼ 10mbar). The coolest regions occur at nightside mid-latitudes with temperatures of ∼400 K. These low temperature regions correspond to the large scale, nightside vortex regions where global hydrodynamical motions do not efficiently transport dayside hot gas towards. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> displays the 1D (T gas , p gas ) trajectories and shows that the atmosphere contains steep dayside temperature inversions at ∼10 mbar.

Emission of radiation from hot gas at lower pressure is absorbed by the cloud layer at ∼1 bar, resulting in localised heating of the gas.

Zonal mean temperature show how the global temperature structure is changing with latitude and depth. This is useful in order to show global differences between equatorial and mid-high latitude regions for atmospheric properties. Horizontal contours indicate a more uniform variation in temperature in latitude, while vertical contours indicate a greater variation with latitude. Meridional mean temperatures show how the global temperature structure is changing with longitude and depth. This is useful in order to show atmospheric differences between dayside and nightside regions. Horizontal contours indicate a more uniform variation in temperature in longitude, while vertical contours indicate a grater variation with longitude. The highest temperature regions at the upper atmosphere are concentrated at the equator, while a larger (&gt;100 K) difference occurs between equatorial and higher latitude regions. From the meridional mean plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3</ref>, bottom right), a stream of hotter gas is present past the φ = 90 • terminator at 100 mbar due to hydrodynamic flows advecting energy to the nightside and into deeper regions of higher pressure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Seed formation and cloud particle density</head><p>The resultant number density structure of the cloud particles is a combination of the initial nucleation of seed particles and the hydrodynamic motions that transport cloud particles across the globe. Early in the simulation, nucleation begins the cloud formation process with the most efficient nucleation occurring at  the colder nightside mid-latitude regions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Nucleation is a quick processes, and a few minutes/hours into the simulation atomic Ti is too depleted, limiting the nucleation of further cloud particles. The nucleation source term, J * (r), for the dust moment equations presented in Sect. 2.2 becomes negligible across the globe. Further evolution of the number density structure of cloud particles is then determined by the hydrodynamical and particle settling motions, rather than further nucleation. Hotter dayside temperature regions at ∼10 mbar do not nucleate cloud particles at any point in time during the presently simulated epoch, but hydrodynamic motions transport cloud particles into these regions. Seed particles remain thermally stable in these regions throughout the whole time-span of the present simulation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref> shows the number density n d [cm −3 ] of cloud particles after the ∼60 Earth simulated days at isobars from 0.1 mbar -10 bar. The vertical frictional coupling between dust particles and gas is large enough that cloud particles move with the 3D gas flow efficiently. This means, because we assume horizontal coupling, the highest cloud particle number density occurs near and at the equatorial regions for all atmospheric pressures. Drift velocities are small (v dr ∼10 −4 . . . 0.3 m s −1 ) throughout the atmosphere ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1)</ref>, generally &lt;10 % the local vertical gas velocity. This is a purely hydrodynamical effect and implies that the local grain sizes are not large enough to cause a significant decoupling in the vertical direction. Cloud particle motion is therefore dominated by the horizontal gas velocity (i.e. v dr u gas,v &lt; u gas,h ). The cloud structure predominantly follows the horizontal velocity structures in the atmosphere. For example, cloud particles entering the equatorial jet stream will typically spend a longer time circulating in these regions due to the lower flux of particle out from the central jet, either from meridional motions or vertical settling. Therefore, after a few days of simulation, after seed particle nucleation has become inefficient, equatorial regions are typically denser by ∼0.5 magnitudes compared to mid-high latitudes. This is despite the majority of the seed particle nucleation taking place on nightside high-latitude regions, where the flow speed is typically slower, in the first hours of the simulation. There is a build up of material on approach to the φ = 270 • terminator corresponding to regions of highest horizontal velocity (u h ∼ 7000 m s −1 ). This is due to the equatorial jet transporting material quickly around to the nightside and slowing down significantly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4)</ref> when reaching the night-day terminator. This build up of cloud particles means that the overall flux of particles entering the dayside regions is reduced. Additionally, particles entering the equatorial dayside regions are also transported quickly back onto the nightside by the equatorial jet, increasing the flux of particles towards the nightside. This leads to differences in clouds number density, n d , between the dayside and nightside. The cloud number density at 0.1, 1 and 10 mbar is also slightly (∼1 %) reduced by downward flows dragging the cloud particles to deeper depths near the day-night φ = 90 • terminator and replenished by similar amounts at the upwelling night-day φ = 270 • terminator. At deeper regions (&gt;100 mbar), due to the lower vertical gas velocities, the effect of vertical velocity on the number density structure is negligible. At depths greater than 100 mbar there is less difference in number density between nightside-dayside and equatorial-high latitude regions. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> show 1D trajectory plots and the zonal and meridional mean number density as a function of pressure. These clearly show a thicker cloud layer from ∼100 mbar -10 bar which is relatively uniform throughout the planet which contains micron sized grains <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 9)</ref>. On average, the atmosphere is fairly uniform in number density with 10-20% differences between equatorial and mid-high latitude regions and comparable difference between nightside and dayside regions. This finding has implications for the cloud opacity which will therefore mainly be affected by the size of the cloud particles and their mixed material composition.</p><note type="other">Article number, page 10 of 24 G.

The gas dynamics then transports them, over time, to the equatorial regions where most of the cloud particles can be found by the end of the simulation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Cloud particle sizes</head><p>Cloud particle sizes are a direct result of our cloud formation model (Sect. 2.2). Each growth species local growth/evaporation rate (Eq. 16) determines the local grain size, which is a function of the local number of elements and temperature. It also depends on the sinking/settling of cloud particles of different sizes over time as larger grains sink faster to higher pressure regions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure  8</ref> shows the mean grain size a <ref type="bibr">[µm]</ref> of cloud particles at pressure isobars from 0.1 mbar -10 bar. Dayside regions from 0.1 mbar -1 bar contain smaller grains while the nightside contains larger grains. This is most evident from the 0.1 and 10 mbar plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 8</ref> where larger grains (&gt;0.1 µm) reside on the nightside while smaller grains (&lt;0.1 µm) are found on the dayside. Asymmetry in grain size between equatorial and mid-high latitudes is also seen, with equatorial regions containing the smallest grains at any given atmospheric pressure and larger grains supported at higher latitudes. At ∼10 mbar seed particles (∼0.001 µm) reside on the dayside, corresponding to the highest upper atmosphere temperature regions where all other growth species are evaporated. At depths ∼ 1 bar particles grow to 1 µm sizes or larger. At such high densities, the frictional coupling to the gas phase is almost complete, resulting in very small drift velocities (v dr &lt; 0.001 m s −1 ).</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 9</ref> the 1D trajectories at equatorial and mid-latitudes show a varied depth dependent grain size. Nightside and midlatitude terminator regions regions typically contain grain sizes of ∼0.1 µm or less down to 1 bar where they grow to micron sizes and above. Dayside and the φ = 90 • , 135 • equatorial profiles show the presence of seed particles from ∼0.1-100 mbar. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure  9</ref> shows the zonal and meridional averaged mean particle size  <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.

The atmosphere typically contains sub-micron particles down to a pressure level of ∼5 bar. The equatorial dayside regions contain the smallest particulates from 0.1-100 mbar. The nightside mean particle size is also ∼0.5-1 magnitudes larger than the dayside grains but remain sub-micron at these pressure levels. The largest particles (∼0.1-1 mm) reside at the most dense parts of the atmosphere at gas pressures &gt; 10 bar. Gradients (up to 1 order of magnitude) in cloud particle size occur near the φ = 90 • terminator, while grain sizes at the φ = 270 • terminator remain relatively homogenous with longitude. This suggests that transit spectroscopy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pont et al. 2013</ref>) would sample a variety of cloud particle sizes. The lower temperature regions at the center of vortex regions on the upper atmosphere nightside contain the largest cloud particles at each pressure level, suggesting that these vortex regions can efficiency trap and grow larger particles.</p><p>In summary, our model produces a variety of cloud particle sizes dependent on the local thermo-chemical conditions of the atmosphere. A large portion of the hot equatorial dayside contains seed particles of nm size in contrast to the cooler, nightside and mid-latitude regions where grain sizes can be &gt; 0.1 µm. We, however, note that the present results are limited to the growth of TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref>   <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] materials, which suggest that the present grain sizes to be a lower limit (Sect. 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Cloud material composition</head><p>Cloud particles form that are made of a mix of materials that are locally thermally stable. The composition of these material mixes changes depending on the local thermo-chemical conditions that a cloud particle may encounter when being advected due to the presence of a velocity field. Depending on the local temperature and element abundance properties, different solid growth species may dominate the bulk composition compared to others. The local composition of our mixed material cloud particles is therefore dependent on the local growth and evaporation rates as well as the transport of cloud particles and gas phase elements. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 11</ref> show meridional slices of temperature, cloud particle number density, mean grain size and composition at latitudes θ = 0 • , 45 • respectively. These show a complicated, non-uniform composition structure depending on what material is thermo-chemically favourable at each local atmospheric regions. These plots visualise the interplay between the gas temperature, number density, grain size and composition of the cloud particles. TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] is a high-temperature condensate which forms stable clusters that become subsequently more stable with size through homogenous nucleation. TiO 2 <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref> is therefore an efficient seed formation species and will also contribute to the material richness of the grain mantle by surface growth processes. TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] rich grains (V s /V tot 80%) are generally found between pressures of 1-100 mbar on the dayside of planet, corresponding to the hottest regions of the upper atmosphere. These regions primarily consist of near seed particle size (∼0.001 µm) cloud particles due to the more volatile materials evaporating off the grain surface. These seed particles also appear on the nightside of the planet from φ = 90 • to φ = 135 • at ∼100 mbar due to the equatorial jet efficiently circulating hot gas to the nightside and to greater depths. At mid-latitudes, pure TiO 2 <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref> grains are only found in regions with the highest local gas temperatures at ∼10 mbar, also seed particle sized. These seed particles are thermochemically stable. Elsewhere in the atmosphere, TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] constitutes less than 5% of the grain volume. Other materials grow more efficiently due to the greater element abundance of their constituent elements. Deep atmospheric regions near the lower computational boundary (∼500 bar) contain pure TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] seed particles where other material is thermally unstable.</p><p>SiO <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref> is typically &lt; 5% of the volume fraction in most of the atmosphere. However, it is found in significant volume fractions of &gt; 33% at the equatorial regions from φ = 90 • to φ = ∼315 • at gas pressures of p gas ∼ 0.1-10 mbar. This corresponds to regions of lower gas temperature and density where Mg/Si-growth is unfavourable. <ref type="bibr">SiO[s]</ref> can also be found at the hotter and denser inner atmosphere from 10-100 bar where <ref type="bibr">SiO[s]</ref>   composition in some regions. Grain sizes at these regions are ∼ 0.1 µm. At mid-latitudes, SiO2[s] contributes with &gt;10 % to the total cloud particle volume at all longitudes and pressure levels, with large volume fractions &gt;50 % at dayside pressures of 0.1-1 mbar.</p><p>MgSiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] is perhaps the most interesting species included our models since its optical properties have been used to fit transit spectra, Rayleigh slope observations. We find that it comprises a large amount (V s /V tot &gt; 20%) of the grain composition at mid-high latitudes and at all depths, excluding seed particle regions. However, at equatorial regions it can only be found at the deeper, denser parts of the atmosphere from 100 mbar. At equatorial longitudes from φ = 45 • -90 • at ∼1 mbar it can be found to be 10-20 % of grain volume.</p><p>Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] is found to be the most abundant Mg/Si material. Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] and MgSiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] can be found in the same regions in the atmosphere, and follow similar trends for their thermal stability. However, Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] contributes a larger volume fraction when both materials are thermally stable due to its larger monomer volume. It is the most dominant material at pressures greater than ∼500 mbar with grain volumes over 50%.</p><p>Overall, a complicated longitude, latitude and depth dependence of the cloud composition across the globe with the gas temperature playing a key role. The thermal instability of the silicate materials at the dayside upper atmosphere regions leads to large volumes of the dayside containing thermally stable, nmsized TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Non-uniform element abundances</head><p>To complete our understanding of why certain mineral materials are thermally unstable at certain atmospheric regions, we look at the elemental abundances of elements involved in the cloud formation. The local element abundances determine the gas phase chemical composition which are used to determine the composition of the cloud particles. Several materials can be thermally stable at a particular T gas -p gas , meaning each of the condensing materials (S &gt; 1) must be considered when calculating the element depletion <ref type="bibr">(Appendix B, Helling &amp; Woitke 2006</ref>  material has reached an equilibrium state (S = 1), this does not imply that all the constituent elements of the material have been condensed. If the initial abundance of elements in the gas phase is low for a particular element (e.g. Ti), then any changes in the elemental abundance due to the cloud formation processes will be greater compared to more abundant elements. Elements are depleted from the gas phase where cloud particle formation has occurred and are replenished where the material that the cloud particles are composed of has evaporated from the grain bulk. The "evaporation window" of a material marks the atmospheric longitude (φ) location where a particular cloud particle material becomes thermally unstable. As cloud particles are transported towards this longitude by circulating gas, the elements from the unstable material replenishes the gas phase. More volatile materials evaporate further away from the sub-stellar point (φ = 0 • ), while more thermally stable material evaporates closer to the sub-stellar point. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 12</ref> shows meridional slices of the gaseous elemental abundance of Ti, O, Si and Mg at θ = 0 • , 45 • . This shows where elements have been depleted in the atmosphere by the formation of cloud particles or replenished by the evaporation of thermally unstable materials.</p><p>Ti is typically depleted by 2-20 orders of magnitude depending on the location in the atmosphere. The magnitude of this severe depletion is due to the initial solar metallicity low abundance of Ti in the atmosphere. The highest abundance of gas phase Ti elements occurs at the dayside at ∼ 10mbar where Ti is replenished by the evaporation of TiO 2 <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref> in these regions. Seed particles are not evaporated, however, indicating that the TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] seed particles remain thermally stable in these regions. The gas temperature is also too high to nucleate seed particles at these regions. The atmosphere never returns to solar metallicity values due to the thermal stability of the TiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref>   O, the most abundant element considered here, is depleted by a maximum of 30% throughout the atmosphere. Replenishment of oxygen at θ = 45 • , 10 mbar occurs due to the evaporation of O bearing silicate materials.</p><p>Si is the least depleted element on the nightside in comparison to Ti and Mg. Upper cooler atmospheric regions where <ref type="bibr">SiO[s]</ref> is present tend to be less depleted. The depletion of Si at the equator, θ = 0 • , is from SiO 2 [s] growth. The evaporation window for Si/O material is φ ≈ 300 • longitude at 10 mbar. Equatorial jets resupply the nightside with Si elements from evaporating dayside silicate materials.</p><p>Mg is typically more depleted on nightside regions indicating the efficient formation of Mg/Si-material. Gas containing Mg is transported to the nightside by the equatorial jet, where the lower temperatures allow the Mg/Si-material to be thermally stable. Severe depletion occurs at ∼1-10 mbar where Mg/Simaterial surface growth occurs. The evaporation window for Mg/Si-material is φ ≈ 280 • longitude at 10 mbar.</p><p>Due to the global dynamics of the upper atmosphere, any replenished elements from evaporating material at mid-latitudes gets funnelled towards the equator. This hydrodynamic preference is how the mid-latitude, nightside regions contain some of the most element depleted areas of the globe with &gt;10 magni-  tude depletion. Si/O materials are also dominant at the equator due to these hydrodynamic motions, compared to Mg/Si despite both elements have similar initial solar abundances. At midlatitude regions the efficient growth of Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] removes 1 Mg atom more from the gas phase compared to Si atoms for each Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] monomer condensed onto the cloud particle. The meridional motions then funnel gas from these mid-latitudes regions towards the equatorial jet, leading to a greater gaseous abundance of Si at the equator compared to Mg. This is seen in the different ranges of colour bar for Si and Mg in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 12</ref>   <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] at the equatorial thermo-chemical conditions and become the most dominant material compositions at the equator. Over time, this leads to an upper atmosphere equatorial band of <ref type="bibr">SiO[s]</ref> and SiO 2 <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref>. A longitude, latitude and height inhomogeneous element abundance structure develops as the evaporation and growth windows are different for each species as they travel around the atmosphere.</p><p>In summary, the atmosphere is depleted of elements due the cloud formation processes. Local regions of cloud material evaporation on the dayside replenish the gas phase of elements. Replenishment of the nightside of elements is governed through the equatorial jet, which transports uncondensed material from the dayside to the nightside. The gas phase elements are then depleted by growth of material at the cooler regions. A consequence of the dayside thermal instability and hydrodynamic transport of material is that the φ = 90 • terminator region is replenished in metallic elements while the φ = 270 • terminator is severely depleted. The atmosphere never returns to solar element abundances for those elements involved in cloud formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Summary of dynamic cloud formation results</head><p>The previous sections presented each of our cloud formation results individually. In this section, we examine the physics of our results as a whole and explain the cloud formation process on a global scale.</p><p>The nucleation of seed particles early in the simulation begins the cloud formation process. After a few minutes/hours of simulation, the rate of seed particle formation becomes negligible throughout the entire atmosphere due to the depletion of Ti elements from the gas phase. Meanwhile, cloud particles that grow 1 µm begin to settle rapidly from the upper atmosphere to deeper layers (∼ 1 bar), to their pressure supported levels. Settling of cloud particles results in a globally uniform cloud layer of maximum number density at ∼ 1 bar. These settling grains deplete elements from the upper atmosphere. This leaves submicron cloud particles in the upper atmosphere from p gas &lt; 1 bar. Cloud particles are transported by meridional gas motions towards the equatorial jet where the largest number density n d of cloud particles can be found. Cloud particles then follow a circulation cycle as they are transported across the globe, dependent on the local temperature and element abundance conditions. This large scale cloud formation circulation cycle can be summarised as follows: -As cloud particles are transported towards the night-day terminator (φ = 270 • ), the increase in gas temperature leads material to become thermally unstable. The most volatile material evaporates first, while the more stable material evaporates closer to the sub-stellar point (φ = 0 • ). TiO 2 seed particles (∼ 0.001 µm) remain thermally stable. The local gas phase is replenished in elements from the evaporating material. -The equatorial jet transports the element replenished gas phase and the thermally stable seed particles (∼ 0.001 µm) past the sub-stellar point (φ = 0 • ) and to the φ = 90 • daynight terminator. This replenishes the nightside regions near the day-night terminator of uncondensed elements. -From longitudes φ = 90-180 • ; due to the colder nightside temperatures and the replenishment of gas phase elements and transport of seed particles from the equatorial jet, silicate material is thermally stable and condenses onto the seed particles. This depletes the gas phase of elements on the nightside. Due to this cloud formation, particles are ∼ 0.01-0.1 µm in these regions. -Cloud particles remain thermally stable as they are transported through longitudes φ = 180-270 • . The gas phase is severely depleted of elements but the cooler temperatures keep the cloud material thermally stable. The cloud particles are then transported to the night-day terminator (φ = 270 • ) and the cloud formation cycle repeats.</p><p>A characteristic of this element cycle is that the amount of metallic elements returned to the gas phase by dayside grain evaporation is not enough to grow the grains to large sizes (&gt; 1 µm) when they are thermally stable on the nightside. Over time, an upper atmosphere equatorial band of SiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s] and SiO[s] rich grains develops due to greater number of uncondensed Si atoms available at the equator, while Mg atoms condense at higher latitudes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Cloud/gas opacity and radiative effects of clouds</head><p>From Sect. 4.1 the temperature structure of the planet is affected by the presence of cloud particles. The cloud particles add an inhomogeneous opacity distribution to the atmosphere, altering the local radiation fields. A specific feature due to the presence of cloud particles is the equatorial regions temperature bump at ∼1 bar of &gt;100 K. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref> shows the cloud, gas and total opacity at the wavelength midpoints of the wavelength opacity bands in </p><formula xml:id="formula_32">κ cloud (λ) = κ grey + κ RS λ 0.9µm −4 ,<label>(31)</label></formula><p>where κ grey = 0.035 cm 2 g −1 and κ RS = 0.6 cm 2 g −1 . The size and composition dependent cloud opacity that results from the present simulations is typically lower than the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013)</ref> opacity in the upper dayside atmosphere (p gas &lt; 1 bar) but larger and greyer, i.e. less strongly wavelength dependent, at all wavelengths from p gas &gt; 1. x pgas [bar] x pgas [bar] x pgas [bar] highest dayside temperatures occur. The stellar energy deposition drops off rapidly at 100 mbar where some of the coolest dayside temperatures can be found. Compared to a self-consistent gas phase opacity simulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 1</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Tsai et al. 2014</ref>), the peak of stellar energy deposition is at the same pressure level ∼10 mbar. However, the peak of the heating at the sub-stellar point for the gas phase opacity simulation is ∼ 3 erg cm −3 s −1 less and there is a more gradual drop off in heating to ∼ 1 bar. physical cloud structure maintains similar stellar heating regions seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013)</ref>, which suggests that a cloud opacity (parameterised or microphysical) pushes the stellar energy deposition further upward on the dayside atmosphere. The upper atmosphere gas temperature is typically cooler on the dayside and nightside with the microphysical cloud model compared to the parameterised cloud in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013)</ref>. This indicates that the lower cloud opacity in the microphysical model allows the gas to cool more efficiently in these regions than in the Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013) simulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amundsen et al. (2014)</ref> suggest that the Planck averaged gas opacities used in the current study can lead to greater uncertainties in the stellar heating rate compared to other methods. The addition of cloud opacity may reduce this error by muting or washing out the rich molecular lines when the cloud opacity approaches the gas opacity, which can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 13</ref>. However, in regions of low cloud opacity (e.g. seed particle regions) the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amundsen et al. (2014)</ref> suggest that the maximum of the stellar heating rate may occur in deeper atmospheric layers. We hypothesise that this would lead to a smaller or larger vertical extension of the seed particle region on the dayside, depending if this change decreased or increased the temperature at the seed particle region boundaries. Energy deposited at greater depth would be advected more efficiently in the vertical and horizontal directions, which may impact the overall trends of the cloud particles.</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">&lt; 10 −3 10 −3 &lt; x &lt; 10 −1 10 −1 &lt; x &lt; 1 1 &lt; x &lt;</formula><formula xml:id="formula_34">&lt; 10 −3 10 −3 &lt; x &lt; 10 −1 10 −1 &lt; x &lt; 1 1 &lt; x &lt; 10 1 10 λ [µm]</formula><formula xml:id="formula_35">&lt; 10 −3 10 −3 &lt; x &lt; 10 −1 10 −1 &lt; x &lt; 1 1 &lt; x &lt; 10</formula><p>Since the stellar energy deposition is negligible at p gas &gt; 100 mbar, the T gas &gt; 100 K temperature bump seen at the equator <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3)</ref> cannot be due to stellar heating. A backwarming effect due to the presence of the opaque cloud base at ∼ 1 bar occurs. This backwarming was not seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dobbs-Dixon &amp; Agol (2013)</ref>, suggesting that the increased cloud opacity in these regions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.  13)</ref> is responsible for this feature. The gas irradiated by the host star at ∼10 mbar radiates with a Planck function B(λ, T) peak at λ ∼ 1-2 µm. This emitted radiation is then absorbed deeper in the atmosphere where the cloud opacity at ∼1 bar is largest at these infrared wavelengths, heating the local gas phase. The backwarming effect is not seen at mid-latitudes due to the larger grain sizes of the cloud at p gas &lt; 1 bar, producing larger infrared opacity (by up to 3 magnitudes) compared to the equator. The remitted infrared at mid-latitude regions is then absorbed closer to the temperature peak at 10 mbar, which results in a slightly flatter temperature inversion. Therefore, the 100-200 K temperature bump is not seen for mid-high latitude regions. Similar backwarming effects due to cloud particle and/or gaseous opacity have been investigated in previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Helling et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tsuji 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burrows et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Witte et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heng et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Heng &amp; Demory 2013</ref>).</p></div>

The replenishment rate over 1 scale height can be approximated by the mixing timescale τ mix at these depths. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. (2015a)</ref> we estimated that the mixing timescale would be on the order of τ mix ∼ 10 8 s at ∼ 100 bar. The replenishment rate for Mg abundances at these depths can be estimated from ε 0 Mg by τ mix , ε 0 Mg / τ mix ≈ 4 · 10 −13 ε Mg s −1 ; ε 0 Mg = 10 −4.4 and τ mix = 10 8 s. This value would be many times smaller as the mixing material travels several atmospheric scale heights before reaching the upper atmosphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agúndez et al. (2014)</ref> suggest that the mixing timescale may be on the order τ mix ∼ 10 9 s at these depths for HD 189733b, calculated from the GCM mixing tracing method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Parmentier et al. (2013)</ref>. To illustrate this point, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 15</ref> shows snapshot horizontal and meridional mean dn d / dt and dε Mg / dt due to vertical advection at gas pressure iso-bars. The small magnitudes of these changes compared to the absolute values suggest that vertical advection may not significantly alter upper atmosphere cloud particle results during the epoch of the simulation discussed here. Longer integration times (&gt;1000 days) will be required to better understand the effect of deeper mixing of gas phase elements and the settling of smaller particles. However, the results of <ref type="bibr">Parmen- tier et al. (2013)</ref> suggest, for HD 209458b, that sub-micron sized cloud particles may remain present in the upper atmospheric (&gt; 1 bar) layers over longer timescales. Overall, this is in contrast to more convective atmospheres, e.g. Brown Dwarfs, where τ mix is estimated to be ∼ 300 s at ∼ 10 bar , which increases the resupply rate of elements to the upper atmosphere.</p><p>Through our modelling we have shown that mineral cloud particles can survive for many advective timescales in the atmosphere of HD 189733b. Cloud particles are continually transported between warmer and cooler regions by either horizontal motions from warm dayside to cool nightside, or from vertical flows from the cooler upper atmosphere to the warmer inner atmosphere and back again. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Helling &amp; Rietmeijer (2009)</ref> show that SiO <ref type="bibr">2</ref> [s], MgSiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] and Mg 2 SiO <ref type="bibr">4</ref> [s] can crystallise efficiently in supersaturated atmospheric conditions similar to that of hot Jupiters, especially if grains are transported from hotter to cooler regions and vice-versa. In addition, since the cloud particles can survive for long periods in the atmosphere, the internal structure of the grains have time to rearrange into a crystalline structure. This would change the optical properties of the grains, where they would appear more crystalline compared to amorphous grains. This may increase the wavelength dependent back-scattering of photons. Our presented cloud modelling also lends weight to a patchy cloud scenario to explain the Westward offsets in optical phasecurves of some Kepler hot Jupiter exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Heng &amp; Demory 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hu et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Esteves et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shporer &amp; Hu 2015)</ref>. The evaporation window of the reflecting silicate materials in this study occurs φ = 45-90 • longitude Westward from the substellar point, leading to smaller grain sizes, a changed material composition and a large drop in cloud opacity across large areas of the mid and Eastern dayside. Due to the different atmospheric properties of the Kepler planets, should this evaporation window occur closer to the sub-stellar point, the difference in reflectivity of the East and West cloud properties would be become more noticeable. Our current study therefore provides a microphysical basis to the analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Oreshenko et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Parmentier et al. (2016)</ref>. By examining the kinetics of the cloud formation with radiative feedback effects for the Kepler planets, a detailed picture of the composition and size of the optical backscattering material can be calculated. The variability in the reflectivity of Kepler-7b has been shown to be small over the Kepler observing period ), suggesting that a long-term, stable cloud particle hydrodynamic circulation and thermo-chemical cycle is a likely possibility for these atmospheres.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Comparison to 1D results</head><p>In this section we compare our 3D coupled model to our previous 1D post-processing, non-global approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. (2015a</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref>) which were included in previous modelling efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Helling &amp; Woitke 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Helling et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Helling et al. 2016</ref>). The previous 1D study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. (2015a)</ref> showed that some of the neglected species can have significant volume fractions in certain parts of the atmosphere. Al 2 O <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] and CaTiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] were found to be thermally stable at regions of the hot dayside, this is likely to be the same in the 3D RHD case. This suggests that the grain sizes could be underestimated for these regions in the RHD model. However, Al 2 O <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] and CaTiO <ref type="bibr">3</ref> [s] are typically not efficient growth species and are unlikely to grow the grain to significantly larger (&gt; 0.01 µm) sizes. The addition of Fe[s] will effect the thermal stability of the cloud particles, grain sizes and drift velocity and therefore the local degree of element depletion, especially in the deeper regions where other species are less thermally stable compared to Fe <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref>. A richer chemical composition can be expected when additional high-temperature condensates are included. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. (2015a)</ref> generally reproduces the regions of efficient nucleation, growth and evaporation compared to the 3D RHD model, indicating that the chemical processes are accurately captured by the 1D models. The influence of dynamics on the specific cloud properties is large however, which leads to differences in predicted grain sizes between the two approaches. The time dependent settling of ∼ 1 µm grains to their pressure supported regions near 1 bar results in a higher cloud opacity deeper in the atmosphere for the RHD model compared to the 1D models.</p><p>In more general terms, our 1D cloud simulations, Drift, are a valuable analysis tool because they are fast at providing a stationary solution to cloud properties with a substantial degree of chemical details. The 3D RHD simulations with our cloud formation module, are time-consuming but allows us to resolve the time and spacial evolution of a cloud-forming hot Jupiter atmosphere. At present, the time evolution of the current study has focused on the first 60 Earth days and the spacial resolution is limited to that of the RHD/GCM cells. Long-term studies which address the limitations of the current implementation are under development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Summary and conclusions</head><p>We have developed a 3D kinetic cloud formation module for exoplanet RHD/GCM simulations. Through our coupled RHD and cloud model we have shown that HD 189733b has extremely favourable thermodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions for efficient cloud formation and growth. We lend weight to previous interpretations of observations of a thick mineral cloud component containing sub-micron sized particles in the upper atmosphere. The interplay between the hydrodynamical motions and the cloud formation produces an inhomogeneous opacity structure which has effects on the global atmospheric conditions. A summary of key results include:</p><p>-Grain sizes are sub-micron at atmospheric pressures and terminator regions probed by transmission spectroscopy. -Silicate materials are thermally stable in regions probed by transmission spectroscopy. -Grain sizes, number density and opacity of cloud particles are non uniform across the globe with significant differences in longitude, latitude and depth. -Due to the global elemental depletion from cloud formation, the equatorial regions are dominated by <ref type="bibr">SiO</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref>. -Hydrodynamic motions primarily govern the global distribution of cloud particles, transporting cloud particles towards nightside equatorial regions. -The existence of the clouds as well as the particle sizes and material mixes are the result of the kinetic cloud formation processes. -The atmosphere is severely depleted (≥10 orders of magnitude) of elements Ti, Si, Mg used in the cloud formation theory while O is only depleted by ∼30 %. -Mid-high latitude nightside regions are not efficiently replenished in elements and contain the most reduced gas phase elemental abundances. -Thermally unstable materials on the dayside replenish elements to the gas phase; these uncondensed elements are then transported to the nightside via the equatorial jet. -Maximum thermal stability of the cloud particles are found at the coolest parts of the nightside inside the large scale vortex regions.</p><p>We improve on previous 1D approaches by developing an atmospheric RHD model consistently coupled to cloud formation model of with self consistent opacity feedback, element mixing and cloud particle transport and settling. We emphasise that we do not rely on any mixing parameterisation of gaseous /solid material (e.g. by use of K zz ), assumptions about the grain sizes or particle size distributions. Through this early study, we have demonstrated that our kinetic cloud formation model is well suited to be applied to 3D hydrodynamic studies of exoplanet atmospheres. However, long-term studies are required to address the limitations of the current implementation of the cloud module. Potential future applications of our model are 3D Brown Dwarf atmosphere simulations such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Showman &amp; Kaspi (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhang &amp; Showman (2014)</ref>.
