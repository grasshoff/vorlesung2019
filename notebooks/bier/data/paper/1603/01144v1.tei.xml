				<p>We present 15 new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-43b in the i ,g , and R filters with the 1.0-m telescopes of Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network and the IAC80 telescope. We combine our 15 new light curves with 52 others from literature, to analyze homogeneously all the available transit light curves of this exoplanet. By extending the time span of the monitoring of the transits to more than 5 yr, and by analyzing the individual mid-times of 72 transits, we study the proposed shortening of the orbital period of WASP-43b. We estimate that the times of transit are well-matched by our updated ephemeris equation, using a constant orbital period. We estimate an orbital period change rate no larger than ˙ P = −0.02 ± 6.6 ms yr −1 , which is fully consistent with a constant period. Based on the timing analysis, we discard stellar tidal dissipation factors Q * &lt; 10 5. In addition, with the modelling of the transits we update the system parameters: a/Rs = 4.867(23), i = 82.11(10) • and R p /R s = 0.15942(41), noticing a difference in the relative size of the planet between optical and NIR bands.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Exoplanets with ultra short orbital periods ( 1 d) are rare. Of the current ∼ 2000 confirmed exoplanets, 17 objects exhibit orbital periods of less than 1.3 days (based on the exoplanets.org public compilation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Han et al. 2014</ref>). The most extreme case of these objects is the Earth-size planet <ref type="bibr">Kepler-178b</ref>, with an orbital period of only 8.5 h ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013</ref>). Also, 8/17 of these planets have radii of ≤ 2 R Earth , while the rest spans between 10 and 20 Earth radii with masses no larger than than 2 M Jupiter , with the exception of WASP-18b which has an estimated mass of 10 M Jupiter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hellier et al. 2009</ref>). One of these objects is WASP-43b ( <ref type="bibr">Hellier et al. 2011</ref>), a 0.93 R Jupiter size planet with a mass of 1.83 M Jupiter , orbiting a K star in only 0.81 d ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. 2012</ref>). Since its detection and con-firmation by the Wide-Angle Search for Planets (WASP) group, this exoplanet has been studied intensively. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref> reported an extended follow-up which included the observations of 20 transits with the 0.6 m TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) in a I + z filter, 3 transits with the Euler telescope (Gunn − r band) and 7 secondary transits in the NIR (5 in the Sloan − z filter with TRAPPIST and 2 in narrow-band filters at the ESO Very Large Telescope). This work presented an estimation of the planet temperature, T eq = 1440 K, and a re-estimation the planet mass, 2 M Jupiter . Shortly after, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wang et al. (2013)</ref> reported two secondary transit observations, deriving a T planet ∼ 1850 K. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. (2014)</ref> also observed secondary transits with the Spitzer space telescope. Based on the central times of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref> transits and amateur data from the Exoplanet Transit Database (Poddan´ydan´y et al. 2010), <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. (2014)</ref> reported for the first time a hint of change in the orbital period of ˙ P = −0.095 ± 0.036 s yr −1 . Due to the closeness to its host star and the relative high stellar brightness (V = 12.4 mag), WASP-43b is a very suitable target for atmospheric studies. One example of these studies is the transmission spectrum observations obtained with OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murgas et al. (2014)</ref>. In addition to the tentative detection of N aI in the atmosphere of WASP-43b, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murgas et al. (2014)</ref> re-estimated the shortening of the orbital period to ˙ P = −0.15 ± 0.06 s yr −1 by including 5 new epochs in the analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> presented 7 broad-band simultaneous observations (from g to K filter) of a primary and a secondary transit using GROND instrument at the 2.2m MPG/ESO Telescope, reporting a possible difference between the transit depths of the optical and NIR light curves. Furthermore, using a re-analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gillon et al. (2012)</ref> and amateur data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> also calculated a nonnegligible ˙ P = −0.09 ± 0.04 s yr −1 . Recently, 6 transits and 5 eclipses observations with WFC3 instrument on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) were presented to constrain the water abundance in the WASP-43b atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Kreid- berg et al. 2014</ref>). These data were revisited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kataria et al. (2015)</ref> to map the thermal structure of the planet along the full orbital phase and to fit a circulation model of the planet, respectively. Along with these studies on the exoplanet atmosphere, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref> reported high precision mid-times for each transit. Additional transits were also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Maciejewski et al. (2013)</ref>, 1 epoch in R and 1 without filter, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ricci et al. (2015)</ref>, 7 observations of 6 different epochs in the R, V and i filters, giving a a new value of ˙ P = −0.03 ± 0.03 s yr −1 . During the writing of this work, 9 new transits observations of WASP-43b were reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. (2015)</ref>. Combining their data to the literature transits, they found that the amplitude of orbital decay is consistent with previous works, ˙ P = −0.029 ± 0.008 s yr −1 and therefore, a slow decreasing rate of the period was not discarded.</p><p>Here, we present a total of 15 new transit observations on 9 different epochs. Of these, 14 transits were obtained with Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network while one transit was observed with the 0.8m IAC80 Telescope. Combining these new data and all the literature transits available for WASP-43b, we perform an homogeneous analysis of the light curves, with special focus in the transit times, to probe the proposed orbital decay. Along with the timing studies, we also revisited the system and transit parameters of WASP-43b. In Section 2 we present our observations, in Section 3 we describe the modelling of the transits, in Section 4 we present the timing analysis of the transits divided in two parts: in Section 4.1 we present the time analysis of the 58 transits analyzed in this work while in Section 4.2 we include into the analysis additional timing information available for this planet. In Section 5 we use our timing results to constrain the tidal dissipation efficiency of WASP-43. Finally in Section 6 we present our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>We present 15 new observations, obtained in 9 different transit epochs, of the exoplanet WASP43b. Of these, 6 events were observed simultaneously in the i and g filters with the 1.0-m LCOGT Network, other two transits were observed only with the g or the i filter also at the 1.0-m LCOGT, and one additional epoch was observed in the R band with the 0.8-m IAC80 tele-scope at Teide Observatory, Spain. The node of the LCOGT Network located at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile was used to observed 6 of the epochs. The 1.0-m telescopes at the CTIO site are equipped with Sinistro cameras, with a Field-of-View (FoV) of 27 × 27 arcmin 2 , a pixel size of 0.389 arcsec, and a readout time of 51 s without binning. Other two epochs were observed using the telescopes of the node at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). This node was equipped with a Sbig camera with a FoV of 16×16 arcmin 2 , a pixel scale of 0.232 arcsec, and a readout time of 15.5 s when using the 2 × 2 binning mode. Some of the observations were taken with the telescopes defocused in order to increase the number of counts per object without reaching the non-linearity regime of the detectors. The egress of the transit in 2014-May-26 was lost due to bad weather conditions at CTIO.</p><p>The transit at IAC80 telescope was observed using the CAMELOT instrument. CAMELOT has a collector area of 2048x2048 pixels 2 with two readout amplifier channels, a FoV of 10.4x10.4 arcmin 2 and a pixel scale of 0.304 arcsec. The observation was performed using the 500 KHz readout speed in both channels without binning, having thus a readout time of 4.4 s. Our last observation was executed in 2016-Feb-04 and corresponds to the transit epoch 2329 (using as E=0 the reference epoch from <ref type="bibr">Hellier et al. (2011)</ref>). With this observation we extend the monitoring of the WASP-43b transits to 5.2 yr. The observing log of each observation is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Reduction and Photometry</head><p>All images were processed using the pipeline described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. (2013)</ref>. Briefly, the entirely automated procedure includes bad-pixel masking, bias subtraction, dark subtraction, flat field correction and astrometric solution. We used custom made Python pipelines to perform differential aperture photometry on the target and several stars in the FoV are used as reference. We choose the best reference stars by identifying the objects which produce the lowest RMS in the outof-transit (oot) data. The size of the aperture and the ring used to measure the sky background were also chosen with the same RMS criteria. The final aperture radii were on the range of the 13-20 pixels, and the radii and widths of the sky rings were between 18-25 and 10-20 pixels, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Literature transits</head><p>We have included in our homogeneous analysis all the light curves available in the literature. We used 23 transits from Gillon et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2012)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. We also fit the 8 transits recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. (2015)</ref> in order to include their epochs in our timing analysis although we did not use it in Section 3 to derive the final system parameters.</p><p>[ht]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Modelling</head><p>We used the TAP package ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gazak et al. 2012</ref>) for the simultaneous modelling of all the light curves. This package allows to fit for orbital and transit parameters using the analytic function of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mandel &amp; Agol (2002)</ref> to describe the exoplanetary transits. TAP also incorporates the wavelet method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter &amp; Winn (2009)</ref> to estimate the correlated noise in the light curves and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to calculate the uncertainties of the fitted parameters. In particular the parameters subject to be fitted are: orbital period (P ), inclination (i), eccentrycity (e), longitude of the periastron (w), relative distance to the host star (a/R s ), planet-to-star radii ratio (R p /R s ), transit mid-time (T c ) and the coefficients of a limb-darkening quadratic law (u 1 and u 2 ). Furthermore, this version also allows to fit for a time dependent linear function (i.e. F slope and F shif t ) in addition to the noise parameters (σ red and σ white ) from the wavelet method, assuming that the correlated noise can be described by a 1/f γ function, where f is the frequency and γ is assumed to be equal to 1 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carter &amp; Winn (2009)</ref>      In order to explore any variation as a function of wavelength, in a first step we grouped the transits according to the filter and telescope and fit for R p /R s and (u 1 ,u 2 ) on each set of light curves. We modelled i and a/R s simultaneously in all the transits, fixing P to 0.81347385 d from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murgas et al. (2014)</ref>, and e = w = 0. The midtime of each transit ( T c ) and the rest of the parameters were left free to vary individually on each transit. We used 10 MCMC chains of 10 5 links each. The resulting parameters were obtained from the median of the posterior distributions and its respective uncertainties from the 16 and 84 percentile levels. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1 and 2</ref>, we show each transit light curve and its final model for the LCOGT and literature transits, respectively, and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> we show the parameters obtained using TAP. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> we show the values of R p /R s for each group of light curves, which present a very good agreement for the optical filters. Only the two transits in I and i of <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ricci et al. (2015)</ref> deviate from the rest of the optical band transits, probably due to the low quality of these light curves. We also notice that the NIR transits depths (J-,H-and K-bands) also deviate significantly from the optical values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> reported a similar deviation in the z -,H-and K-bands, but their differences were not statistically significant. A multi-epoch study in NIR bands would be needed to confirm this finding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Method 2: Joint modelling with common R p /R s</head><p>To take advantage of the large amount of data we have, we use all the light curves in the modelling to refine the final planet parameters. We repeated the method described in Section 3.1 but this time fitting R p /R s simultaneously for all the optical and the NIR transits from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2014)</ref>. Here we remove some transits from the joint modelling since we have identified in the previous step that its respective R p /R s values deviates considerably from the rest of the transits. In particular, we removed from the simultaneous modelling of R p /R s the i and I transits from <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ricci et al. (2015)</ref>, and the E=538, 554 and 624 transits from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murgas et al. (2014)</ref> whose transit depths were strongly affected by bad weather and/or technical issues during observation. We have not included in this step the data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. (2015)</ref> since these transits were only available at a final stage of this work. As in method 1, the u 1 and u 2  By doing this we obtained Rp/Rs = 0.15942 ± 0.00041 and R p /R s = 0.1498 ± 0.0021 for the optical and NIR bands, respectively. Additionally, we obtained i = 82.11 ± 0.10, and a/R s = 4.867 +0.023 −0.025 from all the light curves. As expected, the values of a/R s and i do not differ from those obtained before, but the optical R p /R s is one order of magnitude more precise by using the joint modelling. Regarding the mid-times of each transit we obtained values fully consistent between the two methods. Our derived R p /R s is also consistent with the values reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murgas et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. (2015)</ref>: 0.15988 +0.00133 −0.00145 , 0.15948 ± 0.00004, and 0.15929 ± 0.00045, respectively. On the other hand, the R p /R s derived from NIR transits deviates significatively from these measurements (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>), even though <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref> value is based on data which cover the J-and Hfilters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R P /R S white (a) clear (b) g (LCOGT) g (c) V (d) R (d) R (b) R (IAC80) R (f) r (e) r (c) i (c) i (LCOGT) i (d) I (d) I+z (e) z (c) J (c) H (c) K (c)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Timing Analysis</head><p>For the modelling of our light curves we use the mid-exposure time of each frame recorded in Julian Days (UTC). Later on, we transform the resulting T c for each transit to Barycentric Julian Days (BJD) in the Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) standard as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Eastman et al. (2010)</ref>. For the literature values we also performed the necessary transformation of the central times of their original time standard to BJD T DB . As mentioned before, we have obtained simultaneous observations of 6 transits epochs with two 1-m LCOGT telescopes (3 additional transits were not observed simultaneously). The mid-times we obtained for each of the simultaneous observations are consistent within the errors, with the exception of the transits of epoch 1834, which deviates by 1.5σ (very likely due to an underestimated error and/or unaccounted systematics in the g transit). Furthermore, our retrieved mid-times for the literature data are also consistent with the original reported values. The average difference between those mid-times is only ∼ 0.35σ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Timing results from the mid-times of our homogeneous analysis</head><p>To adjust the mid-times of the 67 transits obtained in Section 3, we used a linear ephemeris equation of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T (E) = T 0 + E × P,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the central time of the transit T c at epoch E, is calculated with respect to the reference time T 0 using the orbital period P . To update the linear ephemeris we used the scipy.optimize module of Python and the emcee MCMC sampler implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013</ref>). We fit for P and T 0 , and estimate its uncertainties using 1000 walkers with 5000 links each. In a first step, we identified that the two transits of epoch 1469 deviate by more than 147 s. As these transits were not included in the analysis on the original publication (private communication with the author) we also decided to remove them from the timing analysis. After repeating the MCMC analysis for the rest of the 65 transits, we obtained the following ephemeris equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T (E) = 2455528.868602(47) + E × 0.813474077(54),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where the quoted values and their uncertainties (in parenthesis) were adopted from the 50%, 16% and 84% percentiles of the drawn posterior distributions, respectively. The RMS of the timing residuals is 37 s. The χ 2 of this fit is 121, the reduced-χ 2 is 1.93 and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC = 2log(ν) + χ 2 , where ν is the number of degrees of freedom) is 130.</p><p>To probe for orbital decay, i.e. a shortening of the orbital period with time, we also explore the possibility that the transit times can be adjusted by including a quadratic additional term. Therefore we fit the transit times using, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. (2010)</ref>, the following ephemeris equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T c (E) = T 0 + E × P + 1 2 δP × E(E − 1),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the new term δP corresponds to the change rate of the orbital period per epoch −2 (δP = ˙ P ×P ). Using the same procedure as in the linear case, the resulting values of this quadratic fit are: δP = (0.38 ± 1.90) × 10 −10 d epoch −2 , P = 0.81347404(19) d and T 0 (BJD T DB ) = 2455528.868610(66). This new δP , which can be translated to ˙ P = 1.5 ± 7.3 ms yr −1 , is fully consistent with a constant orbital period.</p><p>This quadratic fit has a RM S of 37 s, a χ 2 of 121, a reduced-χ 2 of 1.96 and a BIC quad = 134. These numbers suggest that the linear equation is the most likely function to describe the transits of WASP-43b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Including additional transit mid-times</head><p>Although we could not include in our modelling the transit light curves presented in Hellier et al. (2011) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Stevenson et al. (2014)</ref>, we check our results by using their published mid-times. Since we do not have any common transit as a comparison point we use their reported uncertainties without scaling them. Thus, we repeat the fitting process using a total of 72 transits, resulting in the most comprehensive study of the WASP43b transits to date. We obtain in this case a ˙ P = −0.02 ± 6.6 ms yr −1 , consistent again with the constant orbital period case. Furthermore, in this case the BIC also favors the linear equation (BIC lin = 353) over a non-constant period scenario (BIC quad = 358). Therefore, this new value of ˙ P rules out definitively a rapid or slowly period decay of the WASP-43b exoplanet. Is worth mentioning that our monitoring includes a transit in the epoch=2329, which extends the monitoring 381 d beyond the last epoch reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. (2015)</ref>, totaling more than 5 years of followup. Long term monitoring is critical to probe small amplitude timing variations in the transits of exoplanets (e.g. see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.14</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birkby et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoyer et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Finally, using the 72 transits we calculate the updated linear ephemeris function:</p><p>where the RM S of the timing residuals is 35 s, the reduced-χ 2 = 4.9 and the BIC = 353.</p><p>The </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Constraints on Q*</head><p>Stellar tidal dissipation, usually characterized through the quality or efficiency factor, Q * , can drives the planet orbital motion and determine, for example, the life time before it collides with its host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Levrard et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Penev et al. 2012</ref>). Therefore, empirical constraints of Q * are relevant for models of formation and evolution of close-in exoplanets. Measuring the shortening of orbital periods of transiting exoplanets is a direct way to estimate Q * (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Matsumura et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Penev et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birkby et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hoyer et al. 2016</ref>). For WASP-43, previous studies pointed to Q * between 10 4 − 10 10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hellier et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blecic et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jiang et al. 2015</ref>). In particular, using the equations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birkby et al. (2014)</ref>, we calculate that the previous reported ˙ P = −30 ms yr −1 implies a Q * ≈ 4 × 10 4 and therefore a T shif t ≈ 170 s in the time arrival of the transits after 5 years. Such large time deviation is not detected in our O − C diagram <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4)</ref>. Now, based on the uncertainties of our estimation of ˙ P (±6.6 ms yr −1 ), we derive a Q * ≈ 2 × 10 5 and a T shif t ≈ 39 s after 5 yr which is is consistent with our transit timing, considering the RM S = 35 s of the time residuals we obtained. Larger values of Q * result, after 5 yr, in time deviations of smaller amplitude than the dispersion of the O − C. Thus, for WASP-43 we can discard Q * values smaller than 10 5 . With this precision in ˙ P , and if the dispersion of residuals of the transit times continues in the 30 s level after 5 additional years (i.e. around the epoch 4500), it would be possible to probe the Q * &lt; 10 6 limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>With the timing analysis of 72 transit of WASP43b, we have estimated that the change rate of the orbital period is consistent with zero. By extending the time span of the monitoring to more than 5 yr, i.e. to 2329 orbits, we have constrained the orbital decay to ˙ P = −0.02 ± 6.6 ms yr −1 , which is 3 order smaller than values previously reported. Based on our estimation of ˙ P , we can discard Q * &lt; 10 5 for WASP-43. Finally, by fitting together the optical transit light curves we have a re-estimation of the relative size of the planet, R p /R s = 0.15942 ± 0.00041, a value also consistent with previous studies. We also found a difference between the R p /R s derived from optical and NIR filters. We note that the HST data of <ref type="bibr">Steven- son et al. (2014)</ref> cover the 1.1 − 1.7µm wavelength range, i.e, it includes part of the J and H bands, and their reported R p /R s is fully consistent with our optical results. Thus, additional NIR observations are needed to state definitively this discrepancy.</p><p>This work makes use of observations made in LCOGT network and the IAC80 telescope operated on the island of Tenerife by the IAC in the Spanish Observatorio del Teide.
