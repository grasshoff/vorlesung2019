			<abstract>
				<p>We report the results of our spectropolarimetric monitoring of the weak-line T-Tauri stars (wTTSs) Par 1379 and Par 2244, within the MaTYSSE (Magnetic Topologies of Young Stars and the Survival of close-in giant Exoplanets) programme. Both stars are of a similar mass (1.6 and 1.8 M) and age (1.8 and 1.1 Myr), with Par 1379 hosting an evolved low-mass dusty circumstellar disc, and with Par 2244 showing evidence of a young debris disc. We detect profile distortions and Zeeman signatures in the unpolarized and circularly polarized lines for each star, and have modelled their rotational modulation using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps. We find that Par 1379 harbours a weak (250 G), mostly poloidal field tilted 65 • from the rotation axis. In contrast, Par 2244 hosts a stronger field (860 G) split 3:2 between poloidal and toroidal components, with most of the energy in higher order modes, and with the poloidal component tilted 45 • from the rotation axis. Compared to the lower mass wTTSs, V819 Tau and V830 Tau, Par 2244 has a similar field strength, but is much more complex, whereas the much less complex field of Par 1379 is also much weaker than any other mapped wTTS. We find moderate surface differential rotation of 1.4× and 1.8× smaller than Solar, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. Using our tomographic maps to predict the activity related radial velocity (RV) jitter, and filter it from the RV curves, we find RV residuals with dispersions of 0.017 kms −1 and 0.086 kms −1 for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. We find no evidence for close-in giant planets around either star, with 3σ upper limits of 0.56 and 3.54 M Jup (at an orbital distance of 0.1 au).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Stellar magnetic fields have their largest impact during the early evolution of low-mass stars. T-Tauri stars (TTS) are late-type pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars that are gravitationally contracting towards the MS, and are initially surrounded by a protoplanetary disc (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">André et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Donati &amp; Landstreet 2009</ref>). The radial contraction increases E-mail: chill@irap.omp.eu the density of the stellar interior, and eventually leads to the development of a radiative core (for stellar masses 0.35 M , <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chabrier &amp; Baraffe 1997)</ref>, where the core boundary is known as the tachocline. This change in stellar structure is thought to significantly alter the stellar dynamo mechanism, from one that is distributed throughout the convective zone, to a solar-like dynamo concentrated at the tachocline (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Durney et al. 1993)</ref>. Such changes to the underlying dynamo mechanism may exhibit themselves as variations in the resulting magnetic field topologies, and so observations of magnetic fields on young stars can lead to a better understanding of the behaviour and evolution of the underlying stellar dynamo mechanisms as the star evolves towards the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS).</p><p>At an age of 0.5-10 Myr, TTS may be classified into two groups (based on their accretion status), known as classical T-Tauri stars (cTTSs) and weak-line T-Tauri stars (wTTSs). cTTSs are defined as TTS that are accreting material from a massive (presumably planet forming) disc, whereas wTTSs have exhausted the gas in their inner discs and are no longer accreting (or are accreting at a low level).</p><p>Magnetic fields of cTTSs play a vital role in controlling accretion process and triggering outflows, and largely dictate their angular momentum evolution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bouvier et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Frank et al. 2014</ref>). In particular, large-scale fields of cTTSs can evacuate the central regions of accretion discs, funnel the material on to the star, and enforce co-rotation between the star and the inner disc Keplerian flows, causing cTTSs to rotate more slowly than expected from the contraction and accretion of the disc material (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davies et al. 2014</ref>). Furthermore, magnetic fields of cTTS and their discs can affect the formation and migration of planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baruteau et al. 2014</ref>). Moreover, fields of both cTTSs and wTTSs are known to trigger thermally driven winds through heating by accretion shocks and/or Alfvén waves (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cranmer 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cranmer &amp; Saar 2011)</ref>, resulting in flares, coronal-mass ejections, and angular momentum loss (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aarnio et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Matt et al. 2012)</ref>. It is clear then that characterizing magnetic fields in cTTSs and wTTSs is critical for testing and developing theoretical models (providing more physical realism), and trialling scenarios currently invoked to explain low-mass star and planet formation.</p><p>Magnetic fields were first detected on cTTSs nearly 20 yr ago (e.g. Johns- <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Krull et al. 1999</ref>), and through the MaPP (Magnetic Protostars and Planets) Large Observing Programme allocated on ESPaDOnS on the 3.6-m CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), the large-scale topologies of 11 cTTSs have been revealed (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Donati et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hus- sain et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Donati et al. 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Donati et al. , 2013</ref>. Here, the largescale stellar magnetic fields were mapped by performing an inversion of a time series of spectropolarimetric data, reconstructing the observed field with a spherical harmonic expansion, adopting a maximum-entropy approach. This technique (called Zeeman Doppler Imaging, ZDI) allows one to determine both the field strength and topology. This first survey revealed that the large-scale fields of cTTSs remain relatively simple and mainly poloidal when the host star is still fully or largely convective, but become much more complex when the host star turns mostly radiative ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gregory et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Donati et al. 2013</ref>). This survey also showed that these fields are likely of dynamo origin, varying over timescales of a few years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Donati et al. 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Donati et al. , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Donati et al. , 2013</ref>, and resembling those of mature stars with comparable internal structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Morin et al. 2008</ref>).</p><p>In the case of wTTSs, a total of five stars have been magnetically mapped to date (using ZDI), namely V410 Tau, LkCa 4, V819 Tau, V830 <ref type="bibr">Tau and TAP 26 (Skelly et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carroll et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yu et al. 2017</ref>). These few stars show a much wider range of field topologies compared to cTTSs and MS dwarfs with similar internal structures; while V819 Tau and V830 Tau display a mostly poloidal field topology, V410 Tau and LkCa 4 show significant toroidal components despite being fully convective, in surprising contrast to fully convective cTTSs and mature M dwarfs that harbour relatively simple poloidal fields ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Morin et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Donati et al. 2013</ref>). This toroidal component may develop by the stellar dynamo being influenced by the rapid spin-up that TTS experience, due to their gravitational contraction and angular momentum conservation, once their discs have dispersed (see discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Given that wTTSs are the transitional phase between cTTSs and ZAMS low-mass stars, studies of their magnetic topologies and associated winds are of great interest, as these are the initial conditions in which disc-less PMS stars initiate their unleashed spin-up as they contract towards the ZAMS. This is the goal of the MaTYSSE (Magnetic Topologies of Young Stars and the Survival of close-in giant Exoplanets) Large Programme, allocated at CFHT over semesters 2013a-2016b (510 h) with complementary observations with the NARVAL spectropolarimeter on the 2-m Telescope Bernard Lyot at Pic du Midi in France (420 h) and with the HARPS spectropolarimeter at the 3.6-m ESO Telescope at La Silla in Chile (70 h). As well as determining the magnetic topologies of ∼ 30 wTTSs and monitoring the long-term topology variability of ∼ 5 cTTSs, MaTYSSE will allow us to broadly study magnetic winds of wTTSs and corresponding spin-down rates (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Vidotto et al. 2014</ref>). Furthermore, we are able to filter-out most of the activity-related jitter from the radial velocity (RV) curves of wTTSs (using spectropolarimetry and doppler imaging to model surface activity) for potentially detecting hot Jupiters (hJs; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Donati et al. 2016)</ref>, and thus verifying whether core accretion and migration is the most likely mechanism for forming close-in giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alibert et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>Here, we present full analyses of the phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of Par 1379 and Par 2244, continuing our study of wTTSs in the framework of the MaTYSSE programme. For our study, we first document our observations in Section 2, then review the stellar and disc properties of both stars in Section 3. In Section 4 we describe the results obtained after applying our tomographic modelling technique to the data, and in Section 5 we use these results to filter out the activity jitter from the RV curves, and look for the potential presence of hJs around both stars. In Section 6 we discuss our results and their implications for understanding low-mass star and planet formation. Finally, in Section 7 we provide a summary of our results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS</head><p>Spectropolarimetric observations of Par 1379 were taken in January 2014, with observations of Par 2244 taken in December 2014 and January 2015, both using ESPaDOnS at the 3.6-m CFHT. Spectra from ESPaDOnS span the entire optical domain (from 370 to timesp1000 nm) at a resolution of 65,000 (i.e., a resolved velocity element of 4.6 kms −1 ) over the full wavelength range, in both circular or linear polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Donati 2003)</ref>.</p><p>A total of 10 circularly-polarized (Stokes V ) and unpolarized (Stokes I ) spectra were collected for Par 1379 over a time-span of 14 nights, corresponding to around 2.3 rotation cycles. Time sampling was regular apart from a five night gap due to bad weather near the middle of the run. For Par 2244, 14 spectra were collected over a 25 night timespan, corresponding to around 9.2 rotation cycles. Time sampling for these spectra was irregular, with a six night gap after the first four nights, then an eight night gap after the next 3 nights, with regular spacing after that. These observational gaps, corresponding to two and three rotation cycles, respectively, did not significantly affect our ability to model surface features and magnetic fields (see Section 4), and only became significant when applying our RV filtering technique (as discussed in Section 5).</p><p>All polarization spectra consist of four individual subexposures (each lasting 946.2 s for Par 1379, and 835 s for Par 2244), taken in different polarimeter configurations to allow the removal of all spurious polarization signatures at first order. All raw frames were processed using the esprit software package, which performs bias subtraction, flat fielding, wavelength calibration, and optimal extraction of (un)polarizedéchellepolarizedéchelle spectra, as described in the previous papers of the series ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Donati et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, also see Donati et al. 2010b</ref>, to which the reader is referred for more information. The peak signal-to-noise ratios (S/N, per 2.6 kms −1 velocity bin) achieved on the collected spectra range between 99 to 139 (median 126) for Par 1379, and between 96 and 164 (median 145) for Par 2244, depending mostly on weather/seeing conditions. All spectra are automatically corrected for spectral shifts resulting from instrumental effects (e.g., mechanical flexures, temperature or pressure variations) using atmospheric telluric lines as a reference. This procedure provides spectra with a relative RV precision of better than 0.030 kms −1 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Moutou et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Donati et al. 2008)</ref>. A journal of all observations is presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for both stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STELLAR AND DISC PROPERTIES</head><p>Both stars, belonging to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) flanking fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(F˝ urész et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Tobin et al. 2009</ref>), were classified as wTTSs by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rebull et al. (2000)</ref> due to their young age (based on evolutionary tracks), combined with a lack of UV excess (suggesting low levels of accretion). Indeed, our spectra show strong, non-variable Li i 6708Å6708Å absorption, confirming the young ages of these targets, with the lack of significant veiling supporting their status as wTTSs (see Section 3.3 for further discussion). Moreover, Rebull (2001) report very regular periodic light curves for both Par 1379 and Par 2244 that do not appear like that of a cTTS, further supporting their non-accreting status. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Megeath et al. (2012)</ref> place Par 1379 near the limit between wTTSs and cTTSs (based on mid-infrared photometry).</p><p>Photometric rotation periods of 5.620 ± 0.009 d and 2.820±0.002 d were determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rebull (2001)</ref> for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carpenter et al. (2001)</ref> finding a similar period of 2.83-2.84 d for Par 2244. For the remainder of this work, however, we adopt the rotation periods that are determined from our tomographic modelling in Section 4. Here, the equatorial rotational cycles of Par 1379 and Par 2244 (denoted E 1 and E 2 in Equation 1) are computed from Barycentric Julian Dates (BJDs) according to the (arbitrary) ephemerides <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Journal of ESPaDOnS observations of Par 1379 (first 10 lines) and Par 2244 (last 14 lines). Each observation consists of a sequence of 4 subexposures, each lasting 946.2 s for Par 1379 and 835 s for Par 2244, respectively. Columns 1-4 list (i) the UT date of the observation, (ii) the corresponding UT time at mid exposure, (iii) the Barycentric Julian Date (BJD), and (iv) the peak S/N (per 2.6 kms −1 velocity bin) of each observation.

Column 7 indicates the rotational cycle associated with each exposure, using the ephemerides given in Equation 1. </p></div>

(2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Stellar properties</head><p>We applied our automatic spectral classification tool (discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Donati et al. 2012</ref>) to several of the highest S/N spectra for both stars. This tool is similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Valenti &amp; Fischer (2005)</ref>, and fits the observed spectrum using multiple windows in the wavelength ranges of 515-520 nm and 600-620 nm, using Kurucz model atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kurucz 1993)</ref>. This process yields estimates of T eff and log g, where the optimum parameters are those that minimize χ 2 , with errors bars determined from the curvature of the χ 2 landscape at the derived minimum. For Par 1379, we find that T eff = 4600 ± 50 K and log g = 3.9 ± 0.2 (with g in cgs units).</p><p>Likewise, for Par 2244 we find that T eff = 4650 ± 50 K and log g = 4.1 ± 0.2. Our derived T eff is a good estimate in the approximation of a homogeneous star, however, there are likely large ranges in temperature across the photospheres of both stars, given the high level of spot coverage (see Section 4). A twotemperature model would provide a better T eff estimate of the immaculate photosphere, as well as the level of spot coverage (see Gully- <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Santiago et al. 2017</ref>), however, a homogeneous model is sufficient for our purposes.</p><p>Given the measured V magnitude of 12.8 for both stars, reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rebull et al. (2000)</ref>, and taking into account a spot coverage of the visible stellar hemisphere of ∼ 20 per cent (as is typical for active stars, see Section 4), we derive unspotted V magnitudes of 12.6±0.2 for both stars. We note that assuming a different spot coverage (such as 0 or 30 per cent) places our derived parameters within our quoted error bars.</p><p>Combining our spectroscopic T eff with the intrinsic colour and T eff sequence for young stars found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pecaut &amp; Mamajek (2013)</ref>, we find (V − I c ) 0 to equal 1.09 and 1.07 for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. Using the standard V band extinction of A v = 3.1E(B − V), combined with the conversion of E(V − I c ) = 1.25E(B − V) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bessell &amp; Brett (1988)</ref>, and the measured colours of V − I c (equal to 1.28 and 1.52), we determine A v to be 0.5 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.2, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. Given that we directly measure the spectroscopic temperature, our extinction values are more accurate than those found using colours alone by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rebull et al. (2000)</ref> (equal to 0.2 and 0.23).</p><p>Using the visual bolometric correction BC v expected at these temperatures (equal to −0.57 ± 0.04 and −0.53 ± 0.03, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Pecaut &amp; Mamajek 2013)</ref>, combined with A v , and the trigonometric parallax distance to the ONC of 388 ± 5 pc (corresponding to a distance modulus of 7.94±0.03, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kounkel et al. 2017</ref>), we obtain absolute bolometric magnitudes of 3.6 ± 0.3 and 3.0 ± 0.3, or equivalently, logarithmic luminosities relative to the Sun of 0.45 ± 0.11 and 0.72 ± 0.11, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. When combined with the photospheric temperature obtained previously, we obtain radii of 2.7 ± 0.2 and 3.5 ± 0.2 R .</p><p>Coupling the rotation periods of 5.585 d and 2.8153 d for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively (see Equation 1), with the measured line-of-sight projected equatorial rotation velocity v sin i of 13.7±0.1 and 57.2±0.1 kms −1 (as determined from our tomographic modelling in Section 4), we can infer that R sin i is equal to 1.52 ± 0.04 R and 3.17 ± 0.02 R , where R and i denote the stellar radius and the inclination of its rotation axis to the line of sight. By comparing the radii derived from the luminosities, to that from the stellar rotation, we derive that i is equal to 35 • and 64 • (to an accuracy of 10 • ) for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively.</p><p>Using the evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref> (assuming solar metallicity and including convective overshooting), we find that the stellar masses are 1.6 ± 0.1 M and 1.8 ± 0.1 M , with ages of 1.8 ± 0.6 Myr and 1.1 ± 0.3 Myr, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively (see the H-R diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, with evolutionary tracks and corresponding isochrones). However, using the most recent evolutionary models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baraffe et al. (2015)</ref>, we obtain substantially different stellar masses of 1.3 ± 0.1 M and 1.4 ± 0.1 M , with ages of 1.0 ± 0.5 Myr and 0.5 ± 0.5 Myr, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. Given the inherent limitations of these evolutionary models, we do not consider the formal error bars on the derived masses and ages to be representative of the true uncertainties, and thus both parameters may be considered to be similar for each star. However, we note that for internal consistency with previous MaPP and MaTYSSE results, the values from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref> models should be referenced. We also note that the ages implied by both the <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baraffe et al. (2015)</ref> evolutionary models are somewhat lower than the mean age of the ONC of 2.2 ± 2 Myr, but are still within the spread of ages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Reggiani et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>As well as placing the stars at younger ages, with lower masses, the internal structure is also somewhat different between these two evolutionary models, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>. Here, the size of the convective envelope (by radius) for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref> models is around 70 per cent for both stars, whereas the Baraffe et al. (2015) models suggest both stars are fully convective. The most critical change in large-scale magnetic field topology is expected to occur when the star evolves from one that is largely convective, to one that is largely radiative (&gt; 50 per cent by radius, depending on the stellar evolution model; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gregory et al. 2012</ref>). Given that the observed field topologies for both stars show non-axisymmetric, mid-to-weak strength poloidal fields (see Section 4.2), the models of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref> place the stars in better agreement with expectations. Furthermore, the weaker field strength and higher differential shear (see Section 4.3) of Par 1379 suggests that it is likely more structurally evolved than Par 2244, possibly to the point of being mostly radiative (despite the model predictions), whereas Par 2244 is still in a largely convective state.</p><p>A more complete study of the change in magnetic topology with internal structure will be performed for the wTTSs in the MATYSSE sample in a future publication, where we will also discuss the implications for different evolutionary models. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Model and grid description</head><p>Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of Par 1379 and Par 2244 were constructed using photometric data collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rebull et al.

Deep, sensitive sub-mm and mm photometry are not currently available for the sources. The SEDs reveal that Par 1379 has an infrared excess starting at 2 µm, and that Par 2244 has an infrared excess starting at 22 µm, indicating that both objects have dusty circumstellar discs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>.</p><p>To constrain the basic physical properties of the discs, we fit the SEDs using a passively irradiated dusty disc model. For the modelling, we used the stellar properties derived earlier (in Section 3.1), a parametric disc geometry, and to calculate the disc continuum emission, the MonteCarlo dust-radiative transfer code mcfost ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pinte et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Pinte et al. , 2009</ref>. The parametric disc model has a flared geometry with a Gaussian density profile in the vertical direction ρ(r, z) = ρ(r) exp(−z 2 /2h(r) 2 ). The dust surface density distribution and the scale height as a function of the radius are described with power-laws Σ(r) = Σ 0 (r/r 0 ) α and h(r) = h 0 (r/r 0 ) β respectively, where h 0 is the scale height at the reference radius r 0 . The value of Σ 0 is deduced from the assumed disc dust mass M dust . The free parameters for computing a model are therefore the dust size distribution and composition, the disc inner radius R in , the disc outer radius R out , the dust disc mass M dust , the aspect ratio h 0 /r 0 , the flaring angle β, and the the surface density exponent α.</p><p>We assumed astronomical silicate opacities for the dust <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Draine &amp; Lee 1984)</ref> and tested models with two dust size distributions: a small dust distribution with 0.01-10 µm sized grains, and a large dust distribution with 0.01-2000 µm grains, assuming a size distribution slope of 3.5 for both distributions. We used a reference radius r 0 of 1 au and a flaring angle β of 1.1. Furthermore, we assumed disc inclinations of 36 • and 59 • for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively (from our tomographic modelling in Section 4), and a distance of 388 pc for both objects.</p><p>For each of the sources, we ran a uniform grid of SED models, varying the free parameters as described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The grid includes disc-like models extending tens to hundreds of au and narrow ring-like models with a width of a few au. In total we tested 3936 models for Par 1379, and 2430 models for Par 2244. For each SED model the χ 2 statistic was computing using the logarithm of the flux in each photometric band. Each χ 2 lead to a model probability defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P = exp − χ 2 /2</formula><p>. The ensemble of probabilities P of the grid were normalized such that the sum of P in the entire grid is equal to 1. Armed with the probability for each model in the grid, we constructed histograms for each free parameter, by summing P over all models in the grid that had the same value of the free parameter. In the case of R in and R out , for calculating the histograms, the sum of P in each histogram bin was divided by the number models in that bin, and the histograms were re-normalized such that their sum is equal to 1. This was necessary because models with R out &lt; R in are not possible, and the histograms need to be corrected for the different number of models per bin. Additionally, in the case of R in and R out , and M dust and R out , we constructed 2-D χ 2 plots to reveal cross correlations between these parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">SED fitting results</head><p>Our results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 2 and B1</ref>, and Table 3. Ring and disc solutions describe the SED equally well, highlighting that the solutions are degenerate. Indeed, to better distinguish between the models, one would require sensitive sub-mm and mm photometry as well as spatially resolved imaging. However, despite the degeneracies, we may draw general conclusions given that the near-IR SED enable us to constrain the inner radius of the IR-excess emission, as well as the disc's scale height (if the emission is optically thick). Furthermore, the SED provides us with an order-ofmagnitude estimate of the dust mass, given a disc's geometry and extension.</p><p>In the case of Par 1379, the near-IR excess requires the presence of warm dust at R&lt; 1 au. The probability histogram ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure B1</ref>) clearly displays a higher probability for models with inner radius 0.15 and 0.2 au. The outer disc is less well constrained, but there is a preference for models with an outer disc radius smaller than 10 au. The solution with the minimum χ 2 has R in = 0.15 au, and R out = 5 au. However, one should bare in mind that the preference for discs with an outer radius smaller than 10 au in the grid could be a bias due to the absence of sensitive sub-mm photometry. The SED could in fact be explained either by a narrow, low-mass (10 −7 M ) ring of warm dust between 0.15-1 au, a disc with mass 10 −6 M extending from 0.15 to 10 au, or a large 100 au disc with a dust mass of 10 −5 M (note that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure B1</ref>, for R in = 0.15 au, the probability of models with R out &gt; 2 au is similar). Large and dust grains distributions appear to have similar probabilities, and the dust surface density exponent is not well constrained, as all the values in the grid display a similar probability. However, the model with the minimum χ 2 has a dust distribution with large grains, and a dust mass of 10 −6 M with α = −1.0.</p><p>Compared with the dust mass measured in the discs of cTTSs in Taurus (10 −6 -10 −4 M , <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Andrews &amp; Williams 2005)</ref>, Par 1379 has a lower dust mass than a typical cTTS, if the disc of Par 1379 is smaller than 10 au. However, if the disc of Par 1379 is large, then its dust mass would be comparable to those of standard cTTS discs. The scale height h/r required to fit the SED of Par 1379 is between 0.02-0.03 at 1 au -a value similar to the scale height of 0.03 of an isothermal disc in hydrostatic equilibrium around a 1.6 M star at 1 au, assuming a mid-plane temperature of 350 K <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> . The scale height suggested by the SED fit indicates that some gas might be still present in the disc. In summary, the SED of Par 1379 suggests that it is surrounded by a dusty disc extending down to the silicate sublimation radius, and that this disc is likely primordial as its scale height is consistent with a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium.</p><p>In the case of Par 2244, the SED fit reveals that there is an inner dust cavity of at least 10 au in radius, with the models that best describe the data possessing an inner radii of 20 au. Dusty rings around 20-30 au with a width of 10-20 au have higher probabilities in the grid, however, a dust disc extending 10-100 au can also satisfactorily describe the data. The model with the lowest χ 2 is a dusty ring extending from 30-40 au, with a dust mass of 10 −7 M and large dust grains. However, a similar model with a small dust distribution and a mass of 5 × 10 −9 M describes the data equally well. The lack of sensitive sub-mm photometry limits our ability to distinguish between these two models, however, in the whole ensemble of the grid there is the statistical trend that the models that best reproduce the SED have dust masses of 10 −9 -10 −8 M , which are very low masses, when compared to the mass of cTTS in Taurus. The low dust-mass suggested by the SED fit (solutions are optically thin) together with the lack of strong accretion signatures (see Section 3.3), hints that Par 2244 has either recently dissipated its gaseous disc and we only observe the remaining primordial dust, or alternatively, that Par 2244 harbours a young debris disc. We note, however, that the grid slightly favours large grain solutions, lending weight to the hypothesis of remaining primordial dust. As the solutions are optically thin, stringent constraints on the scale height and surface density exponent can not be derived. In summary, the SED suggests that Par 2244 is surrounded by a low mass 10 −9 -10 −8 M dusty disc, extending at least to 50 AU with a 10 -20 au cavity. Par 2244 could be considered as a nonaccreting transition disc, or a young-debris disc.</p><p>Given that we detect discs around both our target stars, we may estimate the age at which disc locking ceased by assuming a disc-locking period of 6-12 d (for stars with M &gt; 0.3 M , see <ref type="bibr">Landin et al. 2016</ref>) with constant angular momentum evolution since then.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Accretion status</head><p>The presence of dusty discs in Par 1379 and Par 2244 raises the question of whether the discs still have gas, and whether the stars are still accreting. Given that we have obtained multiple high-quality spectra of both targets, we may determine their accretion status using several metrics. We find that Par 1379 and Par 2244 both show core Ca ii infrared triplet (IRT) emission, with mean equivalent widths (EWs) of around 0.44Å44Å (15.5 kms −1 ) and 0.20Å20Å (7.3 kms −1 ), similar to what is expected from chromospheric emission for such PMS stars, and somewhat lower than that for accreting cTTSs (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Donati et al. 2007</ref>). We also find that both Par 1379 and Par 2244 show Hα, Hβ and He i D 3 emission, with Par 1379 in particular displaying a timevarying absorption component in both Hα, Hβ.</p><p>One may estimate the level of surface accretion in TTSs by adopting the relations between line luminosity L line and the accretion luminosity L acc of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alcalá et al. (2017)</ref>. For this purpose we determined L line by assuming blackbody scaling using the stellar radius R and T eff given in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. Then, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gullbring et al. (1998)</ref>, the mass accretion rate M acc was calculated using the relationship</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M acc = L acc R GM (1 − R R in )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where R in denotes the truncation radius of the disc, and is taken to be 5R ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gullbring et al. 1998</ref>).</p><p>For Par 1379, we detect weak He i D 3 emission, with an EW of around 0.012Å012Å (0.6 kms −1 ), corresponding to log M acc −10.7 M yr −1 . For Hβ, we detect absorption components in several line profiles between phases 0-0.4 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>), and we find the EW of the Hβ emission to range between 0.01-0.34Å34Å (average of 0.16Å16Å, equivalent to 9.8 kms −1 , corresponding to log M acc −10.6 M yr −1 ). Moreover, we detect a redshifted absorption component (in addition to the emission) in several Hα line profiles between phases 0.0-0.4 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>). We find the EW of the emission ranges between 1.4-3.6 ˚ A (average of 2.4 ˚ A, equivalent to 108 kms −1 , corresponding to log M acc −9.9 M yr −1 ), and that of the absorption ranges between 0.1-1.4 ˚ A (average of 0.5 ˚ A, equivalent to 24 kms −1 ). In the case of Par 2244, we detect very weak He i D 3 emission, with an EW of around 0.005Å005Å (0.25 kms −1 ), corresponding to log M acc of around -11.1 M yr −1 . Furthermore, we find weak Hβ emission, with an average EW of 0.06Å06Å (3.7 kms −1 , corresponding to log M acc −10.9 M yr −1 ). Moreover, we do not find any absorption in the Hα profiles of Par 2244, with the mean emission EW of 1.3 ˚ A (60 kms −1 , corresponding to log M acc −10.1 M yr −1 , see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>). At such low EWs and accretion rates, chromospheric activity becomes a significant influence on the strength and width of emission lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ingleby et al. 2011</ref>). For TTSs in particular, their large convective turnover times (Gilliland 1986) combined with their rapid rotation means they possess a low Rossby number, placing them well within the saturated activity regime (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Reiners et al. 2014</ref>). For young stars, the Hα line luminosity is observed to saturate at around log[L(Hα)/L bol ] = −3.3 or lower (around −3.8 for K4 spectral types, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrado y Navascués &amp; Martín 2003</ref>; around −4.0 for later spectral types, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Newton et al. 2017</ref>). As our target stars both show line luminosities below these levels, with log[L(Hα)/L bol ] equal to −4.5 for Par 1379 and −5.0 for Par 2244, any measurements of accretion rates based on the line luminosities (especially Hα, and to a lesser extent Hβ) must be considered to be significantly influenced or even dominated by chromospheric activity.</p><p>The limit at which one can distinguish between accretion and chromospheric activity has been explored by several authors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Barrado y Navascués &amp; Martín (2003)</ref> propose a spectral-type dependant relationship between the EW(Hα) and the accretion rate. Their empirical criterion is based on the saturation limit of chromospheric activity (taken to be log[L(Hα)/L bol ] = −3.3) and is used to distinguish between accreting and non-accreting stars and brown dwarfs. Adopting the spectral type of K4 for both Par 1379 and Par 2244, as determined from our spectroscopic temperature in Section 3.1, the criterion of Barrado y <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Navascués &amp; Martín (2003)</ref> define a cTTS threshold of EW(Hα) = 4.4 ˚ A. Given that the EW(Hα) of Par 1379 and Par 2244 are both below these limits (with maxima of 3.6 and 2.1 ˚ A for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively), both stars fall into the nonaccreting regime (where line broadening is dominated by chromospheric activity).</p><p>Elsewhere, the impact of chromospheric activity on accretion rate measurements was explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Manara et al. (2013)</ref>, where the authors determined the point at which the line emission may be dominated by the contribution of chromospheric activity (termed chromospheric accretion 'noise'). Using the empirical relationships from <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Manara et al. (2013)</ref>, we have determined that the level of chromospheric noise for Par 1379 and Par 2244 is equal to log (L acc,noise /L star ) = −1.9 ± 0.1. For Par 1379, the measured line luminosities log (L acc /L star ) for Hα, Hβ and He i D 3 are respectively equal to −2.3 ± 0.3, −2.9 ± 0.3 and −3.1 ± 0.3. For Par 2244, we find that log (L acc /L star ) for Hα, Hβ and He i D 3 are respectively equal to −1.9 ± 0.3, −2.0 ± 0.3, and −3.3 ± 0.3. Comparing these values, we see that the luminosity of all three emission lines (for both stars) are significantly below the threshold where the line is dominated by chromospheric emission (apart from Hα and Hβ for Par 2244, which are at a similar level to the chromospheric noise). Thus, the accretion rates determined above for Par 1379 and Par 2244 must be taken to be upper limits, given that chromospheric emission is likely the dominant broadening mechanism. Indeed, Manara et al. (2013) derive a limit for the detectable accretion rate of M acc ∼ 3 × 10 −10 M yr −1 for a 1.1 M mass star at 3 Myr old (the closest mass and age available for our targets). Moreover, as higher mass stars have a higher detection limit, the fact that our derived M acc are lower than this limit indicates that our target stars are likely not accreting, or are accreting at a low (undetectable) level. Thus, as the accretion rates are likely very low, we refer to our target stars as wTTSs.</p><p>Given that the Hα emission in our targets is likely dominated by chromospheric emission, it is somewhat unreliable as a classification and accretion diagnostic. Nevertheless, <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">White &amp; Basri (2003)</ref> have proposed using the width of Hα emission at 10 per cent intensity to distinguish between cTTSs and wTTSs, with stars possessing a width &gt; 270 kms −1 classed as cTTSs (also see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fang et al. 2009</ref>). In the case of Par 1379, we find that the Hα width at 10 per cent intensity ranges between 163-313 kms −1 , with an average of 226 kms −1 , thus placing it well within the wTTS regime (Hα line profiles are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>). Indeed, only three of the ten spectra show a width above 270 kms −1 (at cycles 1.610, 1.783 and 1.974 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>). Compared to the average spectrum, these three line profiles are additionally broadened by a blueshifted emission component. This broadening may be related to accretion, however the blueshifted emission may also be explained by prominences rotating into view (see discussion in Section 6), given the reconstructed magnetic field topology (see Section 4.2). For Par 2244, we find that the Hα width at 10 per cent intensity ranges between 187-430 kms −1 , with an average of 318 kms −1 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref>), thus placing it within the cTTS regime. However, its high v sin i of 57.2 kms −1 (see Section 4) additionally broadens the Hα line, and if this and the significant chromospheric emission is accounted for, Par 2244 likely falls below the threshold for accretion.</p><p>As well as classing our targets as cTTSs or wTTSs, one may also estimate the mass accretion rate using the Hα width at 10 per cent intensity and the relationship found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Natta et al. (2004)</ref>. Here, the accretion rate log M acc for Par 1379 ranges between -9.9 and -11.3 M yr −1 , with an average of -10.7 M yr −1 . For Par 2244, the accretion rate ranges between -8.7 and -11.1 M yr −1 , with an average of -9.8 M yr −1 . However, the authors note that, due to the large dispersion, accretion rates derived from this relationship are necessarily inaccurate for individual objects, and so should be used with care. Indeed, given that Hα is likely dominated by chromospheric emission (see discussion above), this method for deriving accretion rates is unreliable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">TOMOGRAPHIC MODELLING</head><p>Having characterized the atmospheric properties, and the evolutionary and accretion status of Par 1379 and Par 2244, we now apply our dedicated stellar-surface tomographicimaging package to the spectropolarimetric data set described in Section 2. In using this tool, we assume that the observed variability in the data is dominated by rotational modulation (and optionally differential rotation). Then, the imaging code simultaneously inverts a time series of Stokes I and Stokes V profiles into brightness maps (featuring both cool spots and warm plages, known to contribute to the activity of very active stars) and magnetic maps (with poloidal and toroidal components, using a spherical harmonic decomposition). For brightness imaging, a copy of a local line profile is assigned to each pixel on a spherical grid, and the total line profile is found by summing over all visible pixels (at a given phase), where the pixel intensities are scaled iteratively to fit the observed data. For magnetic imaging, the Zeeman signatures are fit using a spherical-harmonic decomposition of potential and toroidal field components, where the weighting of the harmonics are scaled iteratively <ref type="bibr">(Do- nati 2001)</ref>. The data are fit to an aim χ 2 , with the optimal fit determined using the maximum-entropy routine of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gull &amp; Skilling (1991)</ref>, and where the chosen map is that which contains least information (maximum entropy) required to fit the data. For further details about the specific applica-tion of our code to wTTSs, we refer the reader to previous papers in the series (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Donati et al. 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>.</p><p>Given that typical Zeeman signatures have relative amplitudes of ∼ 0.1 per cent, with relative noise levels of around 10 −3 in a typical spectrum (for a single line), we require some means to improve the S/N to a sufficient level for reliable mapping of the stellar magnetic fields. To achieve this, Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Donati et al. 1997</ref>) was applied to all spectra. This technique involves crosscorrelating the observed spectrum with a stellar line-list, and results in a single 'mean' line profile with a dramatically improved S/N, with accurate errorbars for the Zeeman signatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Donati et al. 1997</ref>). The stellar line list used for LSD was sourced from the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD, ?), and was computed for T eff = 4500 K and log g = 4.0 (in cgs units), appropriate for both Par 1379 and Par 2244 (see Section 3.1). Only moderate to strong atomic spectral lines were included (with line-to-continuum core depressions larger than 40 per cent prior to all non-thermal broadening). Furthermore, spectral regions containing strong lines mostly formed outside the photosphere (e.g. Balmer, He, Ca ii H &amp; K and infra red triplet (IRT) lines) and regions heavily crowded with telluric lines were discarded (see e.g. The disc-integrated average photospheric LSD profiles are computed by first synthesizing the local Stokes I and V profiles using the Unno-Rachkovsky analytical solution to the polarized radiative transfer equations in a MilneEddington model atmosphere, taking into account the local brightness and magnetic field. Then, these local line profiles are integrated over the visible hemisphere (including linear limb darkening) to produce synthetic profiles for comparison with observations. This method provides a reliable description of how line profiles are distorted due to magnetic fields (including magneto-optical effects, e.g., Landi Degl <ref type="bibr">'Innocenti &amp; Landolfi 2004</ref>). The main parameters of the local line profiles are similar to those used in our previous studies; the wavelength, Doppler width, equivalent width and Landé factor being set to 670 nm, 1.8 kms −1 , 3.9 kms −1 and 1.2, respectively.</p><p>As part of the imaging process we obtain accurate estimates for v rad (the RV the star would have if unspotted), equal to 30.40 ± 0.07 kms −1 and 27.00 ± 0.05 kms −1 , the v sin i, equal to 13.7 ± 0.1 kms −1 and 57.2 ± 0.1 kms −1 , and the inclination i of the rotation axis to the line of sight, equal to 36 • ± 10 • and 59 • ± 10 • (in excellent agreement with the values derived in Section 3.1) for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the Stokes I and V LSD profiles of Par 1379 and Par 2244, as well as our fits to the data. All our fits correspond to a reduced chi-squared χ 2 r equal to 1 (i.e., where χ 2 equals the number of fitted data points, equal to 260 for Par 1379, and 1246 for Par 2244), emphasising the high quality of our data set and our modelling technique at reproducing the observed modulation of the LSD profiles. While the phase coverage for our two stars is less dense than that for LkCa 4, V819 Tau or V830 Tau (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>, the small rms of the RV residuals for both stars (see Section 5) and the large v sin i for Par 2244 (providing ∼ 4× the resolution compared to Par 1379), means we can safely claim that our maps include no major imaging artefact nor bias.</p></div>

The brightness map of Par 1379 features a single dark, circular spot over the polar region, with a region of bright plage extending from around 70 • to the equator (centred around phase 0.65). These relatively simple features are required to reproduce the observed Stokes I profile distortions for Par 1379 (concentrating in the line cores rather than in the wings, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>), and in particular, the small RV variations (of maximum amplitude 0.28 kms −1 , see Section 5). We find an overall spot and plage coverage of 5 per cent ( 2.5 per cent each for spots and plages), much lower than that for LkCa 4 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>), and around half that for V819 Tau and V830 Tau ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. 2015</ref>).

We find an overall spot and plage coverage of 19 per cent ( 11 and 8 per cent for spots and plages, respectively), where the numerous and complex surface features are required to fit the large RV fluctuations (of maximum amplitude 5.1 kms −1 , see Section 5) of the observed line profiles. We note that the relatively poor fit at cycle 3.225 (providing the largest RV residual, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 10</ref>) coincides with strong, relatively narrow Hα emission (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1)</ref>.</p><p>Note that the estimates of spot and plage coverage should be considered as lower limits only, as Doppler imaging is mostly insensitive to small-scale structures that are evenly distributed over the stellar surface (hence the larger minimal spot coverage assumed in Section 3.1 to derive the location of the stars in the H-R diagram).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Magnetic field imaging</head><p>The reconstructed magnetic fields are described as a sum of a poloidal and toroidal fields, each expressed a sphericalharmonic (SH) expansion, with and m denoting the mode and order of the SH ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Donati et al. 2006</ref>). For a given set of complex coefficients α ,m , β ,m and γ ,m (where α ,m char- acterizes the radial field component, β ,m the azimuthal and meridional components of the poloidal field term, and γ ,m the azimuthal and meridional components of the toroidal field term), one can construct an associated magnetic image at the surface of the star, and thus derive the corresponding Stokes V data set. The inverse is carried out here, where we reconstruct the set of coefficients that fit the observed data.</p><p>The reconstructed magnetic fields of Par 1379 and Par 2244 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>) are quite different in both strength and topological properties. For Par 1379, the field mainly consists of a mostly non-axisymmetric poloidal component (at a level of 74 per cent). The largest fraction of the reconstructed poloidal field energy (45 per cent) is contained in the quadrupolar ( = 2) SH mode, with the remainder split evenly between the other modes (i.e., with =1, 3 and 4). The large-scale topology of the poloidal component is tilted at 65 • from the rotation axis (towards phase 0.41), and generates an intense radial field in excess of 400 G at mid latitudes around phase 0.7 (see top left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>). We also find a mostly-axisymmetric toroidal component (containing 26 per cent of the total energy), with 44 per cent of the toroidal magnetic energy in the = 1 dipole, with a further 33 per cent of the toroidal energy in the = 4 mode, combining to producing fields in excess of 400 G at low to mid latitudes (see centre top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>). In total, we find an unsigned field strength of 250 G.</p><p>For Par 2244, the field mainly consists of a mostly non-axisymmetric poloidal component (58 per cent), with 48 per cent of the reconstructed energy contained in modes with ≥ 4 (with the remaining energy split fairly evenly between modes with &lt; 4). The poloidal component can be approximated at large distances from the star by a 330 G dipole tilted at 45 • from the rotation axis (towards phase 0.57), which when combined with higher order modes generates fields in excess of 1 kG at the surface (see bottom left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>). We also find a significant, mostly axisymmetric toroidal component (42 per cent of the total) with 31 per cent of the reconstructed energy contained in modes with = 1 and 4. This complex topology generates fields in excess of 2 kG at low latitudes (see bottom-centre panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>). In total, we find an unsigned field strength of 0.86 kG. Comparing the brightness and magnetic maps of Par 2244 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 5 and 6, respectively)</ref>, one can see there is some degree of spatial correlation between features. In particular, the moderately strong radial fields (around phases 0.4-0.5), and the strong azimuthal fields at low latitudes (at phases 0.15-0.35 and 0.55-0.65) loosely correlate with the high plage and spot coverage at these phases in the brightness map.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the SH expansions describing the reconstructed field presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> are limited to terms with ≤ 5 for Par 1379, as only marginal changes to the solution are observed when larger values are included, indicating that most of the detected Stokes V signal for Par 1379 concentrates at larger spatial scales. In contrast, the SH expansion for Par 2244 requires terms with ≤ 18 to fit the data to χ 2 r = 1, indicating a more complex and compact magnetic field topology. Given that the amount of reconstructed structure depends on the star's v sin i, we may expect to have around 4 times the effective resolution for Par 2244 as compared to Par 1379. Thus, to compare like-for-like, we reconstructed the brightness and magnetic maps for Par 2244 while limiting the number of SH terms to ≤ 5 (matching that for Par 1379). The resulting maps cannot be fit to the same level of χ 2 r , however, the resulting topology is very similar to that found when including significantly more terms: We find a mainly non-axisymmetric field split 60:40 between poloidal and toroidal components, with the largest fraction of poloidal energy in the ≥ 4 modes, and an unsigned field strength around 30 per cent larger. Thus, as the data were fit in the same manner, we confirm that Par 2244 has a significantly more complex field topology compared to Par 1379. This property is also reflected in the Stokes V profiles of Par 2244, as if one degraded them to the same velocity resolution as Par 1379, the Zeeman signatures would be weaker and more complex than those dominating the Stokes V profiles of Par 1379.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> we present the extrapolated large-scale field topologies of Par 1379 and Par 2244 using the potential field approximation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Jardine et al. 2002)</ref>, and derived solely from the reconstructed radial field components. These potential topologies represent the lowest possible states of magnetic energy, and provide a reliable description of the magnetic field well within the Alfvén radius ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Jardine et al. 2013</ref>). These plots show the largely quadrupolar field of Par 1379, and the complex field of Par 2244 that has a large fraction of energy in higher order modes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Surface differential rotation</head><p>Our observations of Par 1379 and Par 2244 were taken over reasonably long time-spans of 13 d (2.3 rotation cycles) and 26 d (9.3 rotation cycles), respectively, making them well suited to measuring differential rotation in the same way as has been carried out in several previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donati et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Donati et al. , 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>). We achieve this by assuming that the rotation rate at the surface of the star is varying with latitude θ as Ω eq − dΩ sin 2 θ, where Ω eq is the rotation rate at the equator and dΩ is the difference in rotation rate between the equator and the pole. One can then reconstruct brightness and magnetic maps at a given information content for many pairs of Ω eq and dΩ, finding the corresponding reduced chi-squared χ 2 r at which the modelled spectra fit the observations. The topology of the resulting χ 2 r surface usually has a well defined minimum, and by fitting a parabola to this surface, we may estimate both Ω eq and dΩ, and their corresponding error bars. This process has proved reliable for estimating surface differential rotation on various kinds of active low-mass stars (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Donati et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Donati et al. , 2010a</ref>) including wTTSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Skelly et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Skelly et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>, and we refer the reader to these papers for further details of this technique.</p><p>The low v sin i of Par 1379 means our maps have a coarser spatial resolution (as compared to Par 2244), reducing the accuracy to which we can measure differential rotation. However, the large, fairly narrow plage region extending across ∼ 70 • in latitude (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>) is well suited for measuring rotation periods and recurrence rates of profiles distortions across different latitudes. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the χ 2 r surface we obtain (as a function of Ω eq and dΩ) for both Stokes I and V, for Par 1379. We find a clear minimum at Ω eq = 1.125 ± 0.007 rad d −1 and dΩ = 0.039 ± 0.014 for Stokes I data (corresponding to rotation periods of 5.585 ± 0.035 d at the equator and 5.786 ± 0.07 d at the poles; see left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), with the fits to the Stokes V data of Ω eq = 1.118 ± 0.011 rad d −1 and dΩ = 0.039 ± 0.023 showing consistent estimates, though with larger error bars (right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>For Par 2244, we find a clear minimum in the χ 2 surface for Stokes I data at Ω eq = 2.2276 ± 0.0004 rad d −1 and dΩ = 0.0075 ± 0.0017 rad d −1 (left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Likewise, we also find a clear minimum for the fits to Stokes V data at Ω eq = 2.218 ± 0.0018 rad d −1 and dΩ = 0.0306 ± 0.0067 (right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). While these estimates do not agree within the formal error bars of the parabolic fit (to the region around the minimum), the minima found for each data set do however overlap at the 3σ level (see centre panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). We attribute the discrepancy between minima to the temporal evolution of spots and plages over the observation window, confusing the measurements for Stokes I data. This line of reasoning is supported by the fact that, for the same level of information content (i.e., unsigned magnetic field strength) we cannot fit the <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>.

The source surfaces at which the field becomes radial are set at distances of 5.5 R for Par 1379 and 2.7 R for Par 2244, as these are close to the co-rotation radii (where the Keplerian orbital period equals the stellar rotation period, and beyond which the field lines tend to open under the effect of centrifugal forces, Jardine 2004), but are smaller than the Alfvén radii of &gt; 10 R ( <ref type="bibr">Réville et al. 2016</ref>).

Furthermore, we obtain better fits to the Stokes I data when it is split into two groups that were obtained at similar times, and fit using Ω eq and dΩ derived from Stokes V data (further discussed in Section 5). Hence, we consider the values of Ω eq and dΩ derived from Stokes V data to be more robust (giving rotation periods of 2.8153 ± 0.0023 d at the equator and 2.872 ± 0.039 d at the poles).</p><p>We note that the values of Ω eq and dΩ determined above (for both brightness and magnetic maps, for both stars) do not change significantly when the LSD profiles are fit to different levels of information content (fitting to 30 per cent less and 5 per cent more information, compared to that for χ 2 r = 1), demonstrating the robustness of this method against under or over-fitting the data. Furthermore, the rotation periods of Par 1379 and Par 2244 determined from our analysis agree (to within 1 and 2σ) with the photometric periods found by Rebull (2001) of 5.62 ± 0.009 d and 2.82 ± 0.002 d, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">FILTERING THE ACTIVITY JITTER TO SEARCH FOR HOT JUPITERS</head><p>As well as studying the topology of magnetic fields, the MaTYSSE program also aims to detect potential hJs to quantitively assess the likelihood of the disc migration scenario (where giant planets form in the outer accretion disc and then migrate inward until they reach the central magnetospheric gaps of cTTSs, see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lin et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Romanova &amp; Lovelace 2006</ref>). We achieve this in practice by filtering out the activity-related jitter from the RV curves of wTTS, by subtracting the first-order moments of our fits to the LSD profiles, from those of the observed data (following the methods outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>. Then, once the predicted activity jitter has been removed, one can look for periodic signals in the RV residuals that may probe the presence of hJs. This method has been used with great success for other stars in the MaTYSSE sample, leading to the detection of a hJ around both V830 Tau ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Donati et al. , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Donati et al. , 2017</ref> and TAP 26 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yu et al. 2017</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the predicted activity jitter and filtered RVs we derive for Par 1379 and Par 2244. For Par 1379, the filtering process is very efficient, with the RV residuals exhibiting an rms dispersion of ∼ 0.017 kms −1 . These low residuals demonstrate that we are able to fit the simple surface features of Par 1379 to a very high degree -well below the intrinsic RV precision of ESPaDOnS (around 0.03 kms −1 , e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Moutou et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Donati et al. 2008</ref>), and to a similar level as the intrinsic uncertainty of the filtering process itself (around 0.01 kms −1 in this case). Indeed, the filtered RVs are consistent with having zero amplitude (within their error bars). Hence, we find that Par 1379 is unlikely to host a hJ with an orbital period in the range of what we can detect (i.e. not too close to the stellar rotation period or its first harmonics; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>), with a 3σ error bar on the semi-amplitude of the RV residuals equal to 0.024 kms −1 , translating into a planet mass of 0.56 M Jup orbiting at 0.1 au (assuming a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of the star; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>).</p><p>For Par 2244, the filtered RVs showed a significant rms dispersion of 0.15 kms −1 (using the optimum Ω eq and dΩ from Stokes I fitting; we find an rms dispersion of 0.14 kms −1 using the optimum fit to Stokes V data). Such a large dispersion is insignificant for assessing spot/plage coverage and magnetic field topology, but is very significant when searching for close-in giant planets. As mentioned previously, we attribute this large dispersion to the evolution of surface features over the observation gaps of 2 and 3 rotation cycles between data collection (around 6 and 8 nights, respectively; see Section 2), as starspot lifetimes are expected to range from several weeks to months (e.g., <ref type="bibr">I¸sikI¸sik et al. 2007</ref>). To take account of this evolution in our map reconstruction and RV filtering procedure, we split the Stokes I LSD profiles into two groups of seven (with the first group spanning <ref type="bibr">18-29 Dec 2014</ref>, and the second group 06-13 Jan 2015, i.e., after the gap of 3 rotation cycles). Then, each set of 7 LSD profiles was fit to the same level of spot and plage coverage as that found for the best fit to the complete data set. Adopting the optimum parameters for Stokes I data, this process yielded rms dispersions of the filtered RVs of 0.104 kms −1 and 0.131 kms −1 , for the first and second maps, respectively. However, when using the optimum parameters for Stokes V data, we find smaller rms dispersions of 0.084 kms −1 and 0.087 kms −1 for each map (an average of 0.086 kms −1 ), respectively, suggesting that the differential rotation measurement from fitting Stokes V data is more robust against the intrinsic evolution of surface features. Indeed, the magnitude of these dispersions are similar to the 0.087 kms −1 uncertainties on the filtered RVs, showing that our tomographic modelling can account for the majority of the RV variability. These residuals are lower than our detection threshold of 0.1 kms −1 (from preliminary simulations, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>). Furthermore, we find no significant peaks in a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the filtered RVs. Thus, we conclude that Par 2244 is unlikely to host a hJ with an orbital period of what we can detect, with a 3σ error bar on the semi-amplitude of the RV residuals equal to 0.206 kms −1 , translating into a value of ∼ 3.54 M Jup for a planet orbiting at a distance of 0.1 au (again assuming a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of the star; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>).</p><p>We note that we also fit both Stokes I and Stokes V profiles simultaneously for each group of 7 profiles, with the resulting magnetic field topologies being largely similar to that found when fitting all 14 profiles, except that the unsigned field strength was around 20 per cent lower. However, we were unable to reliably constrain a measurement of differential rotation using only 7 profiles.</p></div>

The centre panel shows the overlap of the confidence ellipses from both measurements, with 1σ, 2σ and 3σ ellipses shown (respectively depicting the 68.3, 95.5 and 99.7 per cent confidence levels) in red and blue for Stokes I and V data respectively. This figure is best viewed in colour.</p><p>at inclinations of 36 • and 59 • . We estimate their ages to be 1.8 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0. We find that Par 1379 harbours a dusty circumstellar disc with an inner radius of around 0.15 au, and with a dust mass ranging between 10 −7 -10 −5 M , with Par 2244 surrounded by a either primordial dust, or a debris disc (starting around 20 au). This may explain why Par 1379 rotates slower than Par 2244, despite being a similar age, suggesting that Par 2244 has dissipated its (presumably less massive) accretion disc somewhat sooner than Par 1379, and has spent more time spinning up.</p><p>By using common tracers of accretion (see Section 3.3), we find that Par 1379 and Par 2244 may be accreting at levels of log M acc −10 to −11 M yr −1 . Given that this accretion rate is so low, our measurements are likely to be strongly affected by chromospheric emission, and so they must be taken as upper limits. These very low accretion rates suggest that these targets may be classed as wTTSs.</p><p>As the accretion rates for Par 1379 are low, there may be other explanations for the absorption features seen in Hα that are unrelated to inflow along an accretion funnel. Using our map of surface magnetic fields (see Section 4.2), we have compared the observed variations in Hα in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure A1</ref> with our potential field extrapolation (see <ref type="figure">Figure A2</ref>). At cycle 0.191, we see the (observed) maximum of redshifted absorption in Hα, with the potential field extrapolation showing several large active regions, with many closed magnetic loops, some of which are aligned along the line of sight. At cycle 0.544, we see no redshifted absorption in Hα, with few regions of closed loops in the field extrapolation, but rather mainly open field lines. Finally, cycle 1.783 also shows no redshifted absorption, but rather blueshifted emission, with the extrapolation showing a region of many closed loops, aligned with the line of sight.</p><p>Given that the absorption appears when we see closed magnetic loops, it may be caused by an infall of material along these loops from flare or prominence material (as seen in the late-type rapid-rotator LO Peg, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Eibe et al. 1999</ref>). Furthermore, the strongest absorption occurs around 140 kms −1 -the same as the free-fall velocity of the star, and so infalling material from the top of the larger loops could create such absorption features. Moreover, the blueshifted emission (seen prominently at cycle 1.783) may trace the same prominence material that falls down towards the star in front of the disc around phase 0.2; the material may have be seen off the stellar limb (as a result of the low inclination), and is thus in emission and moving towards the observer (while still falling onto the star) around half a rotation cycle later. Alternatively, the blue-shifted emission may be caused by erupting prominence material along sight-aligned loops.</p><p>If the redshifted absorption were due to inflow along an accretion funnel, we would expect to see maximum absorption when many open field lines (that are able to connect to the inner disc) are aligned along the line of sight. This is not the case, as there is no absorption at, for example, cycle 0.544 (see <ref type="figure">Figure A2)</ref>, where many open field lines are seen. Additionally, we note that while <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Megeath et al. (2012)</ref> place Par 1379 near the limit between wTTSs and cTTSs, Rebull (2001) report a very regular periodic light curve for Par 1379 that does not appear like that of a cTTS, with <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rebull et al. (2000)</ref> reporting a lack of UV excess, further supporting the non-accreting hypothesis.</p><p>Using our tomographic imaging code (adapted for wTTSs, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>), we derived surface brightness maps and magnetic topologies of both stars. Cool spots and warm plages are found on both Par 1379 and Par 2244, with the latter exhibiting more complex features with higher contrast, that appear to show some intrinsic evolution over our ∼ 1 month observing window.</p><p>The reconstructed magnetic fields for Par 1379 and Par 2244 are significantly different in both strength and topology. Par 1379 harbours a predominately nonaxisymmetric poloidal field (3/4 of the total field), with the largest fraction of energy in the quadrupolar mode, and where the large-scale magnetosphere of the poloidal field is inclined at 65 • to the rotation axis. In contrast, the field of Par 2244 is split 3:2 into a mostly non-axisymmetric poloidal component (with half of the reconstructed energy in modes with ≥ 4), tilted at 45 • from the rotation axis, and a mostly axisymmetric toroidal component. The magnetic field of Par 2244 is fairly similar in strength and topology to that of V410 Tau, the wTTS lying closest in the H-R diagram that has been mapped with ZDI (M = 1.4 ± 0.2 M , age 1.2 Myr, average unsigned field strength 0.49 kG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Skelly et al. 2010</ref>). The fields of both of these stars are split fairly evenly between a mostly nonaxisymmetric poloidal component, and a toroidal component, with a similarly high number of modes required to fit the data ( ≤ 18 for Par 2244, = 15 for V410 Tau).</p><p>Compared to the lower mass wTTSs, V819 Tau and V830 Tau, Par 2244 has a similar field strength, but is much more complex ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. 2015</ref>). The field strength of Par 1379 is also weaker than that of Tap 35 (1500 G), but is similar to the 700 G field of Tap 10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Basri et al. 1992</ref>). In contrast, the much less complex field of Par 1379 is also much weaker than any other wTTSs that has been mapped to date, suggesting it is likely to be more structurally evolved than Par 2244 (assuming the magnetic topology is related to the development of a radiative core, based on Siess et al. 2000 models), becoming largely radiative already, despite model predictions.</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of the similarity between magnetic fields of wTTSs and cTTSs is still premature at this stage. For completeness, however, we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> an H-R diagram of the cTTSs from the MaPP programme, as well as the (analysed) MaTYSSE wTTSs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> also indicates the fraction of the field that is poloidal, the axisymmetry of the poloidal component, and shows PMS evolutionary tracks from <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Siess et al. (2000)</ref>. One can see that the wTTSs studied thus far generally show a wider range of field topologies compared to cTTSs, with large scale fields that can be more toroidal and non-axisymmetric (also see discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. 2015</ref>). Clearly, given our limited sample of wTTSs with which to compare field strength and topology, further studies of MaTYSSE stars are required before we can carry out a full analysis.</p><p>Our data indicate that significant latitudinal shear has occurred for both brightness and magnetic maps over the observation timescales for each star (14 and 25 nights, respectively). For Par 1379, we estimated the amount of differential rotation to be non-zero at a confidence level of 99.5 per cent, with a shear rate 1.4× smaller than that of the Sun (with an equator-pole lap time of 160 d, as opposed to 110 d for the Sun). Furthermore, the estimates derived from brightness and magnetic maps agree to within their error bars. For Par 2244, we estimate the amount of differential rotation to be non-zero at a confidence level of over 99.99 per cent (for both brightness and magnetic maps). We find that the intrinsic evolution of surface features over our observation window resulted in a much lower shear rate for the brightness maps, as compared to the magnetic maps (with shear rates 7.3× and 1.8× smaller than the Sun, for Stokes I and Stokes V data, respectively). However, by accounting for this evolution, we show that the estimate from the magnetic maps is more robust, and so determine the equator-pole lap time to be 205 d. Our results show higher shear rates than those for other wTTSs that have had a similar measurement, namely TWA 6, V410 Tau, V819 Tau, V830 Tau, LkCa 4 and TAP <ref type="bibr">26 (Skelly et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">26 (Skelly et al. , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Yu et al. 2017</ref>). However, all these stars (apart from V410 Tau) have significantly different masses, and occupy a different part of the H-R diagram. Furthermore, our measured shear rates are similar to that found for a cTTS with similar properties, namely V2129 Oph (where the shear is 1.5× smaller than the Sun, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Donati et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Using our tomographic maps to predict the activity related RV jitter, we were able to filter the RV curves of both stars in the search for potential hJs (in the same manner as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Donati et al. , 2015</ref>. For Par 1379, we find that the activity jitter is filtered down to a rms RV precision of 0.017 kms −1 , a value similar to the intrinsic uncertainty of the filtering process itself, and lower than the RV stability of ESPaDOnS. With no significant peaks in a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the filtered RVs, we find that Par 1379 is unlikely to host a hJ with an orbital period of what we can detect, with a 3σ error bar on the semi-amplitude of the RV residuals equal to 0.024 kms −1 , translating into a planet mass of 0.56 M Jup orbiting at 0.1 au. For Par 2244, we find a significantly larger rms dispersion of 0.086 kms −1 , however, these residuals are lower than our estimated detection threshold for hJs ( 0.1 kms −1 , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Donati et al. 2014</ref>). Furthermore, we find no significant peaks in a LombScargle periodogram of the filtered RVs, and thus conclude that Par 2244 is unlikely to host a hJ with an orbital period of what we can detect, with a 3σ error bar on the semiamplitude of the RV residuals equal to 0.206 kms −1 , translating into a value of ∼ 3.54 M Jup for a planet orbiting at a distance of 0.1 au.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">SUMMARY</head><p>We report the results of our spectropolarimetric monitoring of the wTTSs Par 1379 and Par 2244, within the MaTYSSE (Magnetic Topologies of Young Stars and the Survival of close-in giant Exoplanets) programme. We have determined out target stars to be of a similar mass (1.6 and 1.8 M ) and age (1.8 and 1.1 Myr), with Par 1379 hosting an evolved lowmass dusty circumstellar disc, and with Par 2244 showing evidence of a young debris disc. Using several accretion diagnostics, we find that the stars may be accreting at a very low level, however, our derived accretion rates are strongly influenced by chromospheric emission (due to stellar activity), and so are likely unreliable. Using tomographic imaging, we have modelled the rotational modulation of line profile distortions and Zeeman signatures, yielding brightness and magnetic maps of the surface. We find that Par 1379 harbours a weak (250 G), mostly poloidal field tilted 65 • from the rotation axis. In contrast, Par 2244 hosts a stronger field (860 G) split 3:2 between poloidal and toroidal components, with most of the energy in higher order modes, and with the poloidal component tilted 45 • from the rotation axis. Compared to the lower mass wTTSs, V819 Tau and V830 Tau, Par 2244 has a similar field strength, but is much more complex, whereas the much less complex field of Par 1379 is also much weaker than any other mapped wTTS. We find moderate surface differential rotation of 1.4× and 1.8× smaller than Solar. Using our tomographic maps to predict the activity related radial velocity (RV) jitter, and filter it from the RV curves, we find RV residuals with dispersions of 0.017 kms −1 and 0.086 kms −1 for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. We find no evidence for close-in giant planets around either star, with 3σ upper limits of 0.56 and 3.54 M Jup (at an orbital distance of 0.1 au).
