			<abstract>
				<p>A re-analysis of Gliese 581 HARPS and HIRES precision radial velocity data was carried out with a Bayesian multi-planet Kepler periodogram (from 1 to 6 planets) based on a fusion Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In all cases the analysis included an unknown parameterized stellar jitter noise term. For the HARPS data set the most probable number of planetary signals detected is 5 with a Bayesian false alarm probability of 0.01. These include the 3.1498±0.0005, 5.3687±0.0002, 12.927 +0.006 −0.004 , and 66.9±0.2d periods reported previously plus a 399 +14 −16 d period. The orbital eccentricities are 0.0 +0.2 −0.0 , 0.00 +0.02 −0.00 , 0.10 +0.06 −0.10 , 0.33 +0.09 −0.10 , and 0.02 +0.30 −0.02 , respectively. The semi-major axis and M sini of the 5 planets are (0.0285±0.0006 au, 1.9±0.3M ⊕), (0.0406±0.0009 au, 15.7 ± 0.7M ⊕), (0.073 ± 0.002 au, 5.3 ± 0.4M ⊕), (0.218 ± 0.005 au, 6.7 ± 0.8M ⊕), and (0.7 ± 0.2 au, 6.6 +2.0 −2.7 M ⊕), respectively. The analysis of the HIRES data set yielded a reliable detection of only the strongest 5.37 and 12.9 day periods. The analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data again only reliably detected the 5.37 and 12.9d periods. Detection of 4 planetary signals with periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, and 66.9d was only achieved by including an additional unknown but parameterized Gaussian error term added in quadrature to the HIRES quoted errors. The marginal distribution for the sigma of this additional error term has a well defined peak at 1.8 ± 0.4m s −1. It is possible that this additional error arises from unidentified systematic effects. We did not find clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the combined HIRES/HARPS data set.</p>

In addition, the Bayesian MCMC algorithm provides full marginal parameters distributions. The algorithm includes an innovative adaptive control system that automates the selection of efficient parameter proposal distributions even if the parameters are highly correlated Gregory 2010. A recent application of the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gregory &amp; Fischer 2010)</ref> confirmed the existence of a disputed second planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fischer et al. 2002</ref>) in 47 Ursae Majoris (47 UMa) and provided orbital constraints on a possible additional long period planet with a period ∼ 10000d. This paper reports the results of a re-analysis of the HARPS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mayor et al. 2009</ref>) and HIRES data ( <ref type="bibr">Vogt et al. 2010</ref>) for Gl 581 using the above Bayesian multi-planet Kepler periodogram. Section 2 provides an introduction to our Bayesian approach and describes the adaptive fusion MCMC algorithm. Section 3 gives the model equations and priors. Sections 4 and 5 present the parameter estimation and model selection results for the analysis of the HARPS data alone.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE ADAPTIVE FUSION MCMC</head><p>The adaptive fusion 2 MCMC (FMCMC) is a very general Bayesian nonlinear model fitting program. After specifying the model, Mi, the data, D, and priors, I, Bayes theorem dictates the target joint probability distribution for the model parameters which is given by p( X|D, Mi, I) = C p( X|Mi, I) × p(D|Mi, X, I).</p><p>where C is the normalization constant and X represent the set of model parameters. The first term on the RHS of the equation, p( X|Mi, I), is the prior probability distribution of X, prior to the consideration of the current data D. The second term, p(D| X, Mi, I), is called the likelihood and it is the probability that we would have obtained the measured data D for this particular choice of parameter vector X, model Mi, and prior information I. At the very least, the prior information, I, must specify the class of alternative models (hypotheses) being considered (hypothesis space of interest) and the relationship between the models and the data (how to compute the likelihood). In some simple cases the log of the likelihood is simply proportional to the familiar χ 2 statistic. For further details of the likelihood function for this type of problem see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gregory (2005b)</ref>.</p><p>To compute the marginals for any subset of the parameters it is necessary to integrate the joint probability distribution over the remaining parameters. For example, the marginal probability density function (PDF) of the orbital period in a one planet radial velocity model fit is <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Following on from the pioneering work on Bayesian periodograms by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jaynes (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bretthorst (1988)</ref> 2 In earlier papers the algorithm was referred to as a hybrid MCMC. We subsequently learned that this term already exists in the literature in connection with a Hamiltonian version of MCMC. In this paper we replace the term hybrid by fusion. </p><p>where p(P, K, V, e, χ, ω, s|D, M1, I) is the target joint probability distribution of the radial velocity model parameters (P, K, V, e, χ, ω) and s is an extra noise parameter which is discussed in Section 3. p(P |M1, I) is the prior for the orbital period parameter, p(K, V, e, χ, ω, s|M1, I) is the joint prior for the other parameters, and p(D|M1, P, K, V, e, χ, ω, s, I) is the likelihood. For a five planet model fit we need to integrate over 26 parameters to obtain p(P |D, M1, I). Integration is more difficult than maximization, however, the Bayesian solution provides the most accurate information about the parameter errors and correlations without the need for any additional calculations, i.e., Monte Carlo simulations. Bayesian model selection requires integrating over all the model parameters.</p><p>In high dimensions, the principle tool for carrying out the integrals is Markov chain Monte Carlo based on the Metropolis algorithm. The greater efficiency of an MCMC stems from its ability, after an initial burn-in period, to generate samples in parameter space in direct proportion to the joint target probability distribution. In contrast, straight Monte Carlo integration randomly samples the parameter space and wastes most of its time sampling regions of very low probability.</p><p>MCMC algorithms avoid the requirement for completely independent samples, by constructing a kind of random walk in the model parameter space such that the number of samples in a particular region of this space is proportional to a target posterior density for that region. The random walk is accomplished using a Markov chain, whereby the new sample, Xt+1, depends on previous sample Xt according to a time independent entity called the transition kernel, p( Xt+1| Xt). The remarkable property of p( Xt+1|Xt) is that after an initial burn-in period (which is discarded) it generates samples of X with a probability density proportional to the desired posterior p( X|D, M1, I) (e.g., see Chapter 12 of Gregory 2005 for details).</p><p>The transition kernel, p( Xt+1| Xt) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p( Xt+1| Xt) = q( Xt+1| Xt)α( Xt, Xt+1),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where α( Xt, Xt+1) is called the acceptance probability and is given by equation 4. This is achieved by proposing a new sample Xt+1 from a proposal distribution, q( Xt+1| Xt), which is easy to evaluate and is centered on the current sample Xt. The proposal distribution can have almost any form. A common choice for q( Xt+1| Xt) is a multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. With such a proposal distribution, the probability density decreases with distance away from the current sample. The new sample</p><p>Xt+1 is accepted with a probability α( Xt, Xt+1) given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">α( Xt, Xt+1) = min 1, p( Xt+1|D, I) p( Xt|D, I) q( Xt| Xt+1) q( Xt+1| Xt) ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where q( Xt| Xt+1) = q( Xt+1| Xt) for a symmetrical proposal distribution. If the proposal is not accepted the current sample</p><p>Xt is repeated. An important feature that prevents the fusion MCMC from becoming stuck in a local probability maximum is parallel tempering <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Geyer (1991)</ref> and re-invented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hukushima &amp; Nemoto (1996)</ref> under the name exchange Monte Carlo). Multiple MCMC chains are run in parallel. The joint distribution for the parameters ( X) of model Mi, for a particular chain, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">π( X|D, Mi, I, β) ∝ p( X|Mi, I) × p(D| X, Mi, I) β .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Each MCMC chain corresponding to a different β, with the value of β ranging from zero to 1. When the exponent β = 1, the term on the LHS of the equation is the target joint probability distribution for the model parameters, p( X|D, Mi, I). For β ≪ 1, the distribution is much flatter.</p><p>In equation 5, an exponent β = 0 yields a joint density distribution equal to the prior. The reciprocal of β is analogous to a temperature, the higher the temperature the broader the distribution. For parameter estimation purposes 8 chains with β = {0.09, 0.13, 0.20, 0.29, 0.39, 0.52, 0.72, 1.0} were employed. At an interval of 10 iterations, a pair of adjacent chains on the tempering ladder are chosen at random and a proposal made to swap their parameter states. A Monte Carlo acceptance rule determines the probability for the proposed swap to occur (e.g., Gregory 2005a, equation 12.12). This swap allows for an exchange of information across the population of parallel simulations. In low β (higher temperature) simulations, radically different configurations can arise, whereas in higher β (lower temperature) states, a configuration is given the chance to refine itself. The lower β chains can be likened to a series of scouts that explore the parameter terrain on different scales. The final samples are drawn from the β = 1 chain, which corresponds to the desired target probability distribution. The choice of β values can be checked by computing the swap acceptance rate. When they are too far apart the swap rate drops to very low values. A swap acceptance rate of ≈ 40% works well.</p><p>At each iteration, a single joint proposal to jump to a new location in the parameter space is generated from independent Gaussian proposal distributions (centered on the current parameter location), one for each parameter. In general, the σ's of these Gaussian proposal distributions are different because the parameters can be very different entities. If the σ's are chosen too small, successive samples will be highly correlated and will require many iterations to obtain an equilibrium set of samples. If the σ's are too large, then proposed samples will very rarely be accepted. The process of choosing a set of useful proposal σ's when dealing with a large number of different parameters can be very time consuming. In parallel tempering MCMC, this problem is compounded because of the need for a separate set of Gaussian proposal σ's for each tempering chain. This process is automated by an innovative three stage statistical control system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gregory 2007b</ref><ref type="bibr">, Gregory 2009</ref>) in which the error signal is proportional to the difference between the current joint parameter acceptance rate and a target acceptance rate, typically 25% ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Roberts et al. 1997)</ref>. A schematic of the first two stages of the adaptive control system (CS) is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. A third stage that handles highly correlated parameters is described in Section 2.1.</p><p>The first stage CS, which involves annealing the set of Gaussian proposal distribution σ's, was described in Gregory 2005a. An initial set of proposal σ's (≈ 10% of the prior range for each parameter) are used for each chain. During the major cycles, the joint acceptance rate is measured based on the current proposal σ's and compared to a target acceptance rate. During the minor cycles, each proposal σ is separately perturbed to determine an approximate gradient in the acceptance rate. The σ's are then jointly modified by a small increment in the direction of this gradient. This is done for each of the parallel chains. Proposals to swap parameter values between chains are allowed during major cycles but not within minor cycles.</p><p>The annealing of the proposal σ's occurs while the FM-CMC is homing in on any significant peaks in the target probability distribution. Concurrent with this, another aspect of the annealing operation takes place whenever the Markov chain is started from a location in parameter space that is far from the best fit values. This automatically arises because all the models considered incorporate an extra additive noise term (Gregory 2005b) whose probability distribution is Gaussian with zero mean and with an unknown standard deviation s. When the χ 2 of the fit is very large, the Bayesian Markov chain automatically inflates s to include anything in the data that cannot be accounted for by the model with the current set of parameters and the known measurement errors. This results in a smoothing out of the detailed structure in the χ 2 surface and, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ford (2006)</ref>, allows the Markov chain to explore the large scale structure in parameter space more quickly. The chain begins to decrease the value of the extra noise as it settles in near the best-fit parameters. An example of this is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> for a two planet fit to the HARPS data as discussed in Section 4.1. The three panels shows the evolution of the Log10 <ref type="bibr">[Prior × Likelihood]</ref>, the s parameter and the two period parameters. In the early stages the extra noise is inflated to around 16m s −1 and then rapidly decays to much lower values as it homes in on possible solutions. This is similar to simulated annealing, but does not require choosing a cooling scheme. In this example, the starting parameter values were far from the best and the MCMC algorithm finds several less probable solutions on route to a final best choice. Initially it homes in on the two periods of 5.37 and 66.9d and the CS switches off around iteration 220,000, but around iteration 500,000 it detects a much more probable solution for the period combination of 5.37 and 12.9d. In this example the adaptive control system switched on again briefly following the detection of the much improved solution.</p><p>Although the first stage CS achieves the desired joint acceptance rate, it often happens that a subset of the proposal σ's are too small leading to an excessive autocorrelation in the FMCMC iterations for these parameters. Part of the second stage CS corrects for this. The goal of the second stage is to achieve a set of proposal σ's that equalizes the FMCMC acceptance rates when new parameter values are proposed separately and achieves the desired acceptance rate when they are proposed jointly. Details of the second stage CS were given in Gregory 2007b. The first stage is run only once at the beginning, but the second stage can be executed repeatedly, whenever a significantly improved parameter solution emerges. Frequently, the algorithm homes in on the most significant peak within the span of the first stage CS and the second stage improves the choice of proposal σ's based on the highest probability parameter set. Occasionally, a new higher (by a user specified threshold) target probability parameter set emerges after the first two stages of the CS have completed. The control system has the ability to detect this and automatically reactivate the second stage. In this sense the CS is adaptive. If this happens the iteration corresponding to the end of the control system is reset. The requirement that the transition kernel be time independent means that q( Xt+1| Xt) be time independent, so useful FMCMC simulation data are obtained only after the CS is switched off.</p><p>The adaptive capability of the control system can be appreciated from an examination of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. The upper left portion of the figure depicts the FMCMC iterations from the 8 parallel chains, each corresponding to a different tempering level β as indicated on the extreme left. One of the outputs obtained from each chain at every iteration (shown at the far right) is the log prior + log likelihood. This information is continuously fed to the CS which constantly updates the most probable parameter combination regardless of which chain the parameter set occurred in. This is passed to the 'Peak parameter set' block of the CS. Its job is to decide if a significantly more probable parameter set has emerged since the last execution of the second stage CS. If so, the second stage CS is re-run using the new more probable parameter set which is the basic adaptive feature of the existing CS.</p><p>The CS also includes a genetic algorithm block which is shown in the bottom right of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. The current parameter set can be treated as a set of genes. In the present version, one gene consists of the parameter set that specifies one orbit. On this basis, a three planet model has three genes. At any iteration there exist within the CS the most probable parameter set to date Xmax, and the current most probable parameter set of the 8 chains,</p><p>Xcur. At regular intervals (user specified) each gene from Xcur is swapped for the corresponding gene in Xmax. If either substitution leads to a higher probability it is retained and Xmax updated. The effectiveness of this operation can be tested by comparing the number of times the gene crossover operation gives rise to a new value of Xmax compared to the number of new Xmax arising from the normal parallel tempering FMCMC iterations. The gene crossover operations prove to be very effective, and give rise to new Xmax values ≈ 3 times more often. Of course, most of these swaps lead to very minor changes in probability but occasionally big jumps are created.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene swaps from</head><p>Xcur2, the parameters of the second most probable current chain, to Xmax can also be also utilized. This gives rise to new values of Xmax at a rate approximately half that of swaps from</p><p>Xcur to Xmax. Crossover operations at a random point in the entire parameter set did not prove as effective except in the single planet case where there is only one gene. Further experimentation with this concept is ongoing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Highly correlated parameters</head><p>The part of the algorithm described above <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1</ref>) is most efficient when working with model parameters that are independent or transformed to new independent parameters. New parameter values are jointly proposed based on independent Gaussian proposal distributions ('I' scheme), one for each parameter. Initially, only this 'I' proposal system is used and it is clear that if there are strong correlations between any parameters the σ's of the independent Gaussian proposals will need to be very small for any proposal to be accepted and consequently convergence will be very slow. However, the accepted 'I' proposals will generally cluster along the correlation path. In the optional third stage of the control system shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>.1, every second accepted 'I' proposal is appended to a correlated sample buffer. Only the 300 most recent additions to the buffer are retained. A 'C' proposal is generated from the difference between a pair of randomly selected samples drawn from the correlated sample buffer, after multiplication by a constant. The value of this constant is computed automatically by another control system module which ensures that the 'C' proposal acceptance rate is close to 25%. With very little computational overhead, the 'C' proposals provide the scale and direction for efficient jumps in a correlated parameter space.</p><p>The final proposal distribution is a random selection of 'I' and 'C' proposals such that each is employed 50% of the time. The overhead to generate the 'C' proposals is minimal. The combination ensures that the whole parameter space can be reached and that the FMCMC chain is aperiodic.</p><p>The parallel tempering feature operates as before to avoid becoming trapped in a local probability maximum.</p><p>Because the 'C' proposals reflect the parameter correlations, large jumps are possible allowing for much more efficient movement in parameter space than can be achieved by the 'I' proposals alone. Once the first two stages of the control system have been turned off, the third stage continues until a minimum of an additional 300 accepted 'I' proposals have been added to the buffer and the 'C' proposal acceptance rate is within the range 0.22 and 0.28. At this point further additions to the buffer are terminated and this sets a lower bound on the burn-in period.</p><p>Full details on the operation and testing of the combined 'I' and 'C' proposal scheme are given in Gregory 2010.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MODELS AND PRIORS</head><p>In this section we describe the model fitting equations and the selection of priors for the model parameters. We have investigated the Gl 581 data using models ranging from 1 to 6 planets. For a one planet model the predicted radial velocity is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v(ti) = V + K[cos{θ(ti + χP ) + ω} + e cos ω],<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and involves the 6 unknown parameters V = a constant velocity. K = velocity semi-amplitude. P = the orbital period. e = the orbital eccentricity. ω = the longitude of periastron. χ = the fraction of an orbit, prior to the start of data taking, that periastron occurred at. Thus, χP = the number of days prior to ti = 0 that the star was at periastron, for an orbital period of P days.</p><p>θ(ti + χP ) = the true anomaly, the angle of the star in its orbit relative to periastron at time ti.</p><p>We utilize this form of the equation because we obtain the dependence of θ on ti by solving the conservation of angular momentum equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dθ dt − 2π[1 + e cos θ(ti + χ P )] 2 P (1 − e 2 ) 3/2 = 0. (7)</formula><p>Our algorithm is implemented in Mathematica and it proves faster for Mathematica to solve this differential equation than solve the equations relating the true anomaly to the mean anomaly via the eccentric anomaly. Mathematica generates an accurate interpolating function between t and θ so the differential equation does not need to be solved separately for each ti. Evaluating the interpolating function for each ti is very fast compared to solving the differential equation, so the algorithm should be able to handle much larger samples of radial velocity data than those currently available without a significant increase in computational time. For example, an increase in the data by a factor of 6.5 resulted in only an 18% increase in execution time.</p><p>As described in more detail in Gregory 2007a, we employed a re-parameterization of χ and ω to improve the MCMC convergence speed motivated by the work of Ford (2006). The two new parameters are ψ = 2πχ + ω and φ = 2πχ − ω. Parameter ψ is well determined for all eccentricities. Although φ is not well determined for low eccentricities, it is at least orthogonal to the ψ parameter. We use a uniform prior for ψ in the interval 0 to 4π and uniform prior for φ in the interval −2π to +2π. This insures that a prior that is wraparound continuous in (χ, ω) maps into a wraparound continuous distribution in (ψ, φ). To account for the Jacobian of this re-parameterization it is necessary to multiply the Bayesian integrals by a factor of (4π) −nplan , where nplan = the number of planets in the model. Also, by utilizing the orthogonal combination (ψ, φ) it was not necessary to make use of the 'C' proposal scheme outlined in Section 2.1 which typically saves about 25% in execution time.</p><p>In a Bayesian analysis we need to specify a suitable prior for each parameter.

Case (ii) was found to be significantly more successful at converging on the highest posterior probability peak in fewer iterations during repeated blind frequency searches.

Thus, the combination of the known errors and extra noise has a Gaussian distribution with variance = σ 2 i +s 2 , where σi is the standard deviation of the known noise for i th data point.

In this situation periodogram probability peaks are purely the result of the effective noise. The orbits corresponding to these noise induced periodogram peaks exhibited a well defined statistical bias towards high eccentricity. They offered the following explanation for this effect.

The fifth period parameter shows 3 peaks but the 400d period is almost 1000 times stronger than the other two. We filtered the 5 planet MCMC results to only include fifth period values from the 400d peak region and used the Gelman-Rubin (1992) statistic to test for convergence. In parallel tempering MCMC, new widely separated parameter values are passed up the line to the β = 1 simulation and are occasionally accepted. Roughly every 100 iterations the β = 1 simulation accepts a swap proposal from its neighboring simulation. The final β = 1 simulation is thus an average of a very large number of independent β = 1 simulations. We divide the β = 1 iterations into 10 equal time intervals and inter-compared the 10 different essentially independent average distributions for each parameter using a Gelman-Rubin test.

This is done by taking a sample of typically 200 FMCMC iterations and for each iteration we compute the predicted velocity points for that realization of the 5 planet plus V parameter set.

These residuals for the set of observation times are converted to residuals versus phase using the mode of the marginal distribution for the 3.15d period parameter. An orbital phase model velocity fit is then computed at 100 phase points for each realization of the 3.15d planet parameter set obtained in the same sample of 200 iterations as above. At each of these 100 phase points we construct the mean model velocity fit and mean ±1 standard deviation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">MODEL SELECTION FOR HARPS ANALYSIS</head><p>One of the great strengths of Bayesian analysis is the builtin Occam's razor. More complicated models contain larger numbers of parameters and thus incur a larger Occam penalty, which is automatically incorporated in a Bayesian model selection analysis in a quantitative fashion (see for example, Gregory 2005a, p. 45). The analysis yields the relative probability of each of the models explored. To compare the posterior probability of the i th planet model to the four planet model we need to evaluate the odds ratio, Oi4 = p(Mi|D, I)/p(M4|D, I), the ratio of the posterior probability of model Mi to model M4. Application of Bayes theorem leads to,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Oi4 = p(Mi|I) p(M4|I) p(D|Mi, I) p(D|M4, I) ≡ p(Mi|I) p(M4|I) Bi4<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the first factor is the prior odds ratio, and the second factor is called the Bayes factor, Bi4. The Bayes factor is the ratio of the marginal (global) likelihoods of the models.</p><p>The marginal likelihood for model Mi is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">p(D|Mi, I) = d Xp( X|Mi, I) × p(D| X, Mi, I).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Thus Bayesian model selection relies on the ratio of marginal likelihoods, not maximum likelihoods. The marginal likelihood is the weighted average of the conditional likelihood, weighted by the prior probability distribution of the model parameters and s. This procedure is referred to as marginalization. The marginal likelihood can be expressed as the product of the maximum likelihood and the Occam penalty (see Gregory 2005a, page 48). The Bayes factor will favor the more complicated model only if the maximum likelihood ratio is large enough to overcome this penalty. In the simple case of a single parameter with a uniform prior of width ∆X, and a centrally peaked likelihood function with characteristic width δX, the Occam factor is ≈ δX/∆X. If the data is useful then generally δX ≪ ∆X. For a model with m parameters, each parameter will contribute a term to the overall Occam penalty. The Occam penalty depends not only on the number of parameters but also on the prior range of each parameter (prior to the current data set, D), as symbolized in this simplified discussion by ∆X. If two models have some parameters in common then the prior ranges for these parameters will cancel in the calculation of the Bayes factor. To make good use of Bayesian model selection, we need to fully specify priors that are independent of the current data D. The sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the prior range depends on the shape of the prior and is much greater for a uniform prior than a Jeffreys prior (e.g., see Gregory 2005a, page 61). In most instances we are not particularly interested in the Occam factor itself, but only in the relative probabilities of the competing models as expressed by the Bayes factors. Because the Occam factor arises automatically in the marginalization procedure, its effect will be present in any model selection calculation. Note: no Occam factors arise in parameter estimation problems. Parameter estimation can be viewed as model selection where the competing models have the same complexity so the Occam penalties are identical and cancel out.</p><p>The MCMC algorithm produces samples which are in proportion to the posterior probability distribution which is fine for parameter estimation but one needs the proportionality constant for estimating the model marginal likelihood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clyde et al. (2006)</ref> reviewed the state of techniques for model selection from a statistics perspective and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ford &amp; Gregory (2006)</ref> have evaluated the performance of a variety of marginal likelihood estimators in the exoplanet context.</p><p>Estimating the marginal likelihood is a very big challenge for models with large numbers of parameters, e.g., our six planet model has 32 parameters. In this work we employ the nested restricted Monte Carlo (NRMC) method <ref type="bibr">de- scribed in Gregory &amp; Fischer 2010</ref> to estimate the marginal likelihoods. Monte Carlo (MC) integration can be very inefficient in exploring the whole prior parameter range because it randomly samples the whole volume. The fraction of the prior volume of parameter space containing significant probability rapidly declines as the number of dimensions increase. For example, if the fractional volume with significant probability is 0.1 in one dimension then in 32 dimensions the fraction might be of order 10 −32 . In restricted MC integration (RMC) this is much less of a problem because the volume of parameter space sampled is greatly restricted to a region delineated by the outer borders of the marginal distributions of the parameters for the particular model.</p><p>In nested RMC (NRMC) integration, multiple boundaries are constructed based on credible regions ranging from 30% to 99%, as needed. We are then able to compute the contribution to the total integral from each nested interval and sum these contributions. For example, for the interval between the 30% and 60% credible regions, we generate random parameter samples within the 60% region and reject any sample that falls within the 30% region. Using the remaining samples we can compute the contribution to the NRMC integral from that interval.</p><p>The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 22</ref> shows the contributions from the individual intervals for 5 repeats of the NRMC  Similarly, XU9984 = XU99 + (XU99 − XU84).</p><p>The NRMC method is expected to underestimate the marginal likelihood in higher dimensions and this underestimate is expected to become worse the larger the number of model parameters, i.e. increasing number of planets (Gregory 2007c). When we conclude, as we do, that the NRMC computed odds in favor of the five planet model compared to the four planet model is ∼ 10 2 we mean that the true odds is 10 2 . Thus the NRMC method is conservative. One indication of the break down of the NRMC method is the increased spread in the results for repeated evaluations.</p><p>We can readily convert the Bayes factors to a Bayesian False Alarm Probability (FAP) which we define in equation 12. For example, in the context of claiming the detection of m planets the FAPm is the probability that there are actually fewer than m planets, i.e., m − 1 or less. </p><p>If we assume a priori (absence of the data) that all models under consideration are equally likely, then probability of each model is related to the Bayes factors by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p(Mi | D, I) = Bi4 N j=0 Bj4 (13)</formula><p>where N is the maximum number of planets in the hypothesis space under consideration, and of course B44 = 1. For the purpose of computing FAPm we set N = m. Given the Bayes factors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and substituting into equation 12 gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">FAP5 = (B04 + B14 + B24 + B34 + B44) 5 j=0 Bj4 ≈ 10 −2<label>(14)</label></formula><p>For the 5 planet model we obtain a low FAP ≈ 10 −2 .

The last two columns list the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the extra noise parameter, s, and the RMS residual. For each model the NRMC calculation was repeated 5 times and the quoted errors give the spread in the results, not the standard deviation.

The quoted value is the median of the marginal probability distribution for the parameter in question (except eccentricity which uses the mode) and the error bars identify the boundaries of the 68.3% credible region 5 . The value immediately below in parenthesis is the MAP estimate, the value at the maximum of the joint posterior probability distribution. It is not uncommon for the MAP estimate to fall close to the borders of the credible region. In one case, the eccentricity of the fifth planet, the MAP estimate falls well outside the 68.3% credible region which is one reason why we prefer to quote median or mode values as well. The semi-major axis and M sin i values are derived from the model parameters assuming a stellar mass of 0.31 ± 0.02 M ⊙ ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Delfosse et al. 2000)</ref>.

The third period parameter exhibited other peaks but these were significantly less probable, the one at 82d is consistent with being a one year alias of the 66.9d period. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 35</ref> shows a plot of eccentricity versus period for a sample of the FMCMC parameter samples for the 3 planet model.

The four planet Kepler periodogram found the four starting periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, and 66.9d and no other peaks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 37</ref> shows the marginal posterior densities of a subset of the parameters. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows a comparison of the estimates of the dc, dsHIRES, and s parameters from the 2, 3, and 4 planet fits to the combined HIRES/HARPS data set. The parameter value listed is the median of the marginal probability distribution for the parameter in question and the error bars identify the boundaries of the 68.3% credible region. The value immediately below in parenthesis is the MAP estimate, the value at the maximum of the joint posterior probability distribution. As expected the extra noise parameter s decreases with the number of planets fit. The estimates of the offset parameter, dc, and the HIRES extra noise parameter, dsHIRES, agree within the quoted uncertainties and these uncertainties are smallest for the 4 planet model fit.</p><p>We carried out an analysis of the 4 planet normalized fit residuals (r1 j ). We define r1 j in equ. 21.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">r1 j = 1 ni n i i=1 residualij error 2 j + ds 2 HIRES i + s 2 i ,<label>(21)</label></formula><p>where j is an index for the combined HIRES/HARPS data set. ni is the number of post burn-in FMCMC equilib-  </p><p>which is the quadrature sum of the quoted error, dsHIRES i , and the extra noise term si. Of course, dsHIRES i only contributes to the effective noise σ of the HIRES data values. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 38</ref> shows a histogram of the r1 j values compared to a suitably normalized Gaussian with zero mean and standard deviation = 1. Within the uncertainties r1 j is consistent with a Gaussian distribution. The reduced χ 2 of the r1 j is given by equ. 23.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">χ 2 1 = 1 nt − np nt j=1 r 2 1 j = 1.008,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where nt = the total number of combined HIRES/HARPS data points and np = 24 is the number of fit parameters. The four period phase plots are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 39</ref>. The top left panel shows the data and model fit versus 3.15d orbital phase after removing the effects of the three other orbital periods. The upper and lower solid curves are the mean FMCMC model fit ±1 standard deviation. The HIRES data points are shown in grey and the error bars are the quoted errors added in quadrature with our median estimate of dsHIRES i = 1.84m s −1 . The other panels correspond to phase plot for the other three periods. Examination of the 66.9d period phase plot indicates that the HIRES data do not lend much support to the 66.9 day period. In fact around a phase of 0.8 there are a series of ∼ 11 points that exhibit a systematic trend away from the mean light curve. To examine this further we carried out a one planet FMCMC fit to the HIRES residuals after subtracting off the 3.15, 5.37, and 12.9d mean orbits. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 40</ref> shows the one planet Kepler periodogram of these residuals. Three prominent peaks are present at 26.3, 65.6, and 73d along with many minor peaks. The thin solid vertical lines highlight these peaks.</p><p>The strongest peak has a period of 73d which explains the absence of good support for a 66.9d period in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 39</ref>.   noise term dsHIRES, as in equ. 24, we conclude dsHIRES = 1.84 +0.35 −0.33 . An alternative possibility that we can test is that the HIRES data are systematically too low by a common factor. To check this out we re-did the four planet analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data using the following noise model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">σHIRES j = (bHIRES × σ quoted j ) 2 + s 2<label>(24)</label></formula><p>We assumed a uniform prior for the unknown parameter bHIRES in the range 0.5 to 4.0. The results were qualitatively very similar to the results obtained with dsHIRES noise term. Following similar calculations to those outlined in Section 6.5 we computed the reduced χ 2 of the residuals divided by the total effective noise σ and obtained a value of 1.009, indistinguishable from the reduced χ 2 obtained using the dsHIRES parameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 43</ref> shows the marginal probability distributions for bHIRES and s parameters. The dashed curve in the lower panel is the marginal for s from the 4 planet fit to the HARPS only data. Employing the bHIRES parameterization results in a significantly larger estimate in the s term than was required by the HARPS only analysis or the dsHIRES parameterization of the combined HIRES/HARPS data.</p><p>Although the two different parameterizations of the HIRES extra noise lead to similar values of the reduced χ 2 we can gain additional insight about which parameterization is better from a more microscopic exploration by binning the 4 planet fit residuals/(effective noise) and examining the χ 2 values of the individual bins. If we add two χ 2 random variables one of which has ν1 degrees of freedom and the other has ν2 degrees of freedom then their sum will be χ 2 with ν1 + ν2 degrees of freedom, e.g., see Gregory 2005a p. 144. Similarly, we can take the quantity r1 j of equ. 23 which is χ 2 with (nt − np) degrees of freedom and divide the r1 j values into k bins. Suppose the k th bin has n k r1 j values then the χ 2 of these values will be given by equ. 25.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">χ 2 k = 1 n k nt × (nt − np) n k j=1 r 2 1 j ,<label>(25)</label></formula><p>which is χ 2 with n k nt × (nt − np) degrees of freedom. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 44</ref> shows a plot of the χ 2 statistic versus the original quoted errors that have been binned into 0.5m s −1 bins for the 4 planet fit to the combined HIRES/HARPS data using the dsHIRES parameterization. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 45</ref> shows a similar plot for the bHIRES parameterization. Ideally the χ 2 distribution would be flat with a value of 1.0. It is clear that the dsHIRES parameterization achieves a flatter distribution than the bHIRES parameterization. Further the noise model involving dsHIRES leads to a jitter noise estimate s which is  much closer to the value expected from the HARPS only 4 planet analysis.</p><p>Our HARPS only analysis provides evidence for 5 planetary signals while incorporating the HIRES data seems to degrade the evidence for both a 66.9 and ∼ 400d periods even when we allow for an extra HIRES noise term of order 1.8m s −1 . We suspect this extra noise term may arise from an as yet unidentified systematics which may be the reason for the degradation in the quality of fits beyond three planets. Alternatively, could unidentified HARPS systematics be responsible for the extra periods evident in their lower noise data?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A Bayesian re-analysis of published HARPS and HIRES precision radial velocity data for Gl 581 was carried out with a multi-planet Kepler periodogram (from 1 to 6 planets) based on our fusion Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In all cases the analysis included an unknown pa-rameterized stellar jitter noise term. For the HARPS data set the most probable number of planetary signals detected is 5. The Bayesian false alarm probability for the 5 planet model is 0.01. These include the 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, 66.9d periods reported previously plus a 399 +14 −16 d period. The orbits of 4 of the 5 planets are consistent with low eccentricity orbits, the exception being the 66.9d orbit where e = 0.33 <ref type="bibr">+0</ref> −0.7 M ⊕ ). The Bayesian false alarm probability for the six planet model is extremely large 0.999978 so we are unable to support any claim for a sixth companion on the basis of the current data.</p><p>The analysis of the HIRES data set yielded a reliable detection of only the strongest 5.37 and 12.9 day periods. The analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data again only reliably detected the 5.37 and 12.9d periods. Detection of 4 planetary signals with periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, and 66.9d was only achieved by including an additional unknown but parameterized Gaussian error term added in quadrature to the HIRES quoted errors. The marginal probability density of the sigma for this additional HIRES Gaussian noise term has a well defined peak at 1.84 +0. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> −0.33 m s −1 . Phase plots indicate that incorporating the HIRES data seems to degrade the evidence for the 66.9 and ∼ 400d periods even when we allow for the extra HIRES noise term. We suspect this extra noise term may arise from unidentified systematics which may be the reason for the degradation in the quality of fits beyond three planets. Alternatively, could unidentified HARPS systematics be responsible for the extra periods evident in their lower noise data? Independent experimental confirmation of the HARPS low noise level results would be very desirable.</p></div>
