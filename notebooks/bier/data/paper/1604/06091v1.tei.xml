				<p>Contrary to Earth, which has a small orbital eccentricity, some exoplanets discovered in the insolation habitable zone (HZ) have high orbital eccentricities (e.g., up to an eccentricity of ∼ 0.97 for HD 20782 b). This raises the question of the capacity of these planets to host surface liquid water. In order to assess the habitability of an eccentric planet, the mean flux approximation is often used. It states that a planet on an eccentric orbit is called habitable if it receives on average a flux compatible with the presence of surface liquid water. However, as the planets do experience important insolation variations over one orbit and even spend some time outside the HZ for high eccentricities, the question of their habitability might not be as straightforward. We performed a set of simulations using the Global Climate Model LMDz, exploring the limits of the mean flux approximation when varying the luminosity of the host star and the eccentricity of the planet. We computed the climate of tidally locked ocean covered planets with orbital eccentricity from 0 to 0.9 receiving a mean flux equal to Earth&apos;s, around stars of luminosity ranging from 1 L to 10 −4 L. Using here a definition of habitability based on the presence of surface liquid water, we find that most of the planets considered can sustain surface liquid water on the dayside with an ice cap on the nightside. However, for high eccentricity and high luminosity, planets cannot sustain surface liquid water during the whole orbital period. They completely freeze at apoastron and when approaching periastron an ocean appears around the substellar point. We conclude that the higher the eccentricity and the higher the luminosity of the star, the less reliable the mean flux approximation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The majority of the planets found in the insolation habitable zone (HZ, zone in which a planet could sustain surface liquid water, as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>) are on eccentric orbits. The actual percentage depends on the definition of the inner and outer edges considered for the HZ. For instance, about 80% of the planets spending some time in the conservative HZ, whose the inner edge corresponds to the "runaway greenhouse" criterium and the outer edge to the "maximum greenhouse" criterium (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kopparapu 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kopparapu et al. 2014</ref>) have an eccentricity of more than 0.1 <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</p><p>While most of the planets detected in the HZ are very massive planets and probably gaseous, five of them have masses below 10 M ⊕ and eleven of them have radii smaller than 2 R ⊕ (such as <ref type="bibr">Kepler-186f</ref> with an estimated eccentricity of ∼ 0.01, <ref type="bibr">Quin- tana et al. 2014</ref>). Among these sixteen possibly rocky planets, four of them have eccentricities higher than 0.1: GJ 832 c ( <ref type="bibr">Bai- ley et al. 2009</ref>), Kepler-62 e, Kepler-69 c ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borucki et al. 2011</ref>) and GJ 667 Cc (Anglada- <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Escudé et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Robertson &amp; Ma- hadevan 2014)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the characteristics of these four <ref type="bibr">1</ref> http://physics.sfsu.edu/~skane/hzgallery/index.html planets as well as the percentage of the orbital phase spent within the HZ for two different definitions of the inner and outer edges.</p><p>We expect more small planets to be discovered in the HZ with the future missions to increase the statistics (e.g., NGTS, TESS) and also better constrain the eccentricity (e.g., PLATO). In any case, this discovery raises the question of the potential habitability of planets that, as GJ 832 c and GJ 667 Cc, only spend a fraction of their orbit in the HZ.</p><p>The influence of the orbital eccentricity of a planet on its climate has already been studied using various methods: EnergyBalanced Models (EBMs) and Global Climate Models (GCMs). EBMs assume that the planet is in thermal equilibrium: it must radiate on average as much long-wave radiations to space as they receive short-wave radiations from the host star <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Williams &amp; Kasting 1997)</ref>. In such models, the radiative energy fluxes entering or leaving a cell are balanced by the dynamic fluxes of heat transported by winds into or away from the cell. On the contrary GCMs consistently compute on a three-dimensional grid the circulation of the atmosphere using forms of the Navier-Stokes equations. GCMs are therefore more computationally demanding but they are more accurate when simulating a climate. A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. GCM_excentricity_4 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Possibly rocky observed exoplanets with an eccentricity higher than 0.1 (from the Habitable Zone Gallery, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kane &amp; Gelino 2012)</ref>. HZ in−out,c corresponds to the inner and outer edge of the conservative HZ and HZ in−out,o corresponds to the inner and outer edge of the optimistic HZ (the inner edge corresponds to the "recent Venus" criterium and the outer edge to the "early Mars" criterium; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kopparapu 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kopparapu et al. 2014</ref>). τ HZ,c is the percentage of the orbital phase spent within the conservative HZ and τ HZ,o is the percentage of the orbital phase spent within the optimistic HZ. Using a GCM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Williams &amp; Pollard (2002)</ref> studied the influence of the eccentricity on the climate of Earth-like planets around a Sun-like star (with the correct distribution of continents and oceans, a 365 day orbit, a 24 hour day and a 23 • obliquity) and found that surface liquid water is possible even on very eccentric orbits. Using a GCM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Linsenmeier et al. (2015)</ref> studied the influence of both obliquity and eccentricity for ocean covered planets orbiting a Sun-like star on a 365 day orbit and a 24 hour day, like Earth. They found that planets with eccentricities higher than 0.2 can only sustain surface liquid water for a part of the year. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spiegel et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing et al. (2010)</ref> used EBMs to illustrate the effect of the evolution of eccentricity (through pseudo-Milankovitch's cycles; Milankovitch 1941). <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spiegel et al. (2010)</ref> found that the increase of eccentricity of a planet may allow it to escape a frozen snowball state. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing et al. (2010)</ref> found that increasing the eccentricity widens the parameter space in which the planet can only sustain surface liquid water for part of the year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planets</head><p>A major result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Williams &amp; Pollard (2002)</ref> was that the capacity of an eccentric planet of semi-major axis a and eccentricity e to host surface liquid water depends on the averaged flux received over one orbit. This averaged flux corresponds to the flux received by a planet on a circular orbit of radius r = a(1 − e 2 ) <ref type="bibr">1/4</ref> . If this orbital distance is within the HZ, then the planet is assumed to belong to the HZ (or to the eccentric HZ, as defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes et al. 2008)</ref>. However this study was performed by simulating the climate of an Earth-twin planet. The generalization of this result to the diversity of the planets discovered in the HZ is not straightforward. While, we expect this mean-flux approximation to be adequate for planets with low eccentricities, for high eccentricities however, the climate could be drastically degraded when the planet is temporarily outside the HZ. This would especially be an issue for planets around hot stars, for which the HZ is far from the star. The planet could spend a long time outside of the HZ, leading to the freezing of the water reservoir at apoastron and its evaporation at periastron.</p><p>The influence of the stellar luminosity/host star type has previously been considered for Earth-like planets on circular orbits (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Shields et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Shields et al. , 2014</ref>). Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wordsworth et al. (2011)</ref> have studied the climate of GJ 581d orbiting a red dwarf, for two different eccentricities (0 and 0.38). But no work has studied jointly the influence of the planet's eccentricity and the stellar luminosity.</p><p>We therefore aimed to explore here, in a systematic way, the influence of the planet's eccentricity and the star luminosity on the climate of ocean covered planets in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, receiving on average the same flux as Earth. In order to test the limits of the mean flux approximation, we performed three-dimensional GCM simulations for a wide range of configurations: we considered stars of luminosity 1 L , 10 −2 L and 10 −4 L and orbits of eccentricity from 0 to 0.9. We took into account the different luminosities by scaling the orbital period of the planets. It means that we did not consider here the spectral dependance of the stars. We investigated the capacity of these planets to sustain surface liquid water.</p><p>In Section 2, we first present our definition of habitability in terms of surface liquid water coverage. In Section 3, we explain the set-up of our simulations and in Sections 4 and 5, we discuss their outcome in terms of liquid water coverage. In Section 7, we discuss the observability of the variability caused by eccentricity. Finally, in Sections 8 and 9, we conclude this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Liquid water coverage vs. habitability</head><p>In this article, we do not consider that habitability is equivalent to the requirement of having a mean surface temperature higher than the freezing point of water, like in the energy balance models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Williams &amp; Kasting 1996)</ref> or the radiative-convective models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kasting et al. 1993</ref>). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Spiegel et al. (2008)</ref>, we choose here an assessment of the habitability of a planet based on sea ice cover. We focus here only on the presence of surface liquid water without having to conclude about the actual potential of the planets to be appropriate environments for the apparition of life.</p><p>The planets considered in this work are water worlds (or aqua worlds), i.e. planets whose whole surface is covered with water (here treated as an infinite water source). Considering water worlds is especially convenient for a first study because it allows us to have a small amount of free parameters (no land/ocean distribution, land roughness, etc...). A subset of this population is the ocean planets with a high bulk water fraction, which strongly alters their internal structure. Ocean planets were hypothesized in the early 2000s by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kuchner (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Léger et al. (2004)</ref>. They are believed to have a mass ranging from 1 M ⊕ (small rocky planets) to 10 M ⊕ (mini-Neptunes). Their composition was investigated, and the depth of the ocean of a Earth-mass planet was estimated to a few hundred kilometers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sotin et al. 2007</ref>). These planets could be identified providing that we would know mass and radius with enough precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sotin et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sel- sis et al. 2007)</ref>. Despite the lack of knowledge on their mass, some observed planets have been proposed to be ocean planets, for example <ref type="bibr">Kepler-62e and -62f (Kaltenegger et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Article number, page 2 of 17 Emeline Bolmont, et al.: Habitability of planets on eccentric orbits <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Model parameters</head><p>We performed the climate simulations with the LMD generic Global Climate Model (GCM) widely used for the study of extrasolar planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wordsworth et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wordsworth et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Selsis et al. 2011</ref>) and the paleoclimates of Mars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wordsworth et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Forget et al. 2013</ref>). In particular, we used the 3D dynamical core of the LMDZ 3 GCM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hourdin et al. 2006</ref>), based on a finitedifference formulation of the primitive equations of geophysical fluid dynamics. A spatial resolution of 64x48x30 in longitude, latitude, and altitude was set for the simulations. We assumed that the atmosphere is mainly composed of N 2 , with 376 ppmv of CO 2 , which corresponds to an Earth-like atmosphere. The water cycle was modeled with a variable amount of water vapor and ice. Ice formation (melting) was assumed to occur when the surface temperature is lower (higher) than 273 K, and temperature changes due to the latent heat of fusion were taken into account.</p><p>We used <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. (2013)</ref>'s computed high-resolution spectra over a range of temperatures and pressures using the HI-TRAN 2008 database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rothman et al. 2009</ref>). We adopted the same temperature grids as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. (2013)</ref> with values T ={110,170,...,710} K and the same pressure grids with values p ={10 −3 ,10 −2 ,...,10 5 } mbar. The water volume mixing ratio could vary between 10 −7 to 1. The H 2 O absorption lines were truncated at 25 cm −1 , but the water vapor continuum was included using the CKD model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clough et al. 1989</ref>). As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. (2013)</ref>, the opacity due to N 2 -N 2 collision-induced absorption was also taken into account.</p><p>We used the same correlated-k method as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wordsworth et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. (2013)</ref> to produce a smaller database of spectral coefficients suitable for fast calculation of the radiative transfer in the GCM. The model used 38 spectral bands for the thermal emission of the planet and 36 for the stellar emission. In our water world model, we did not take into account the oceanic circulation. We chose an albedo of 0.07 for the surface liquid water and an albedo of 0.55 for the ice and snow.</p><p>We considered the influence of some parameters on the outcome of our simulations: the thermal inertia I oc of the oceans and the maximum ice thickness h ice allowed in our model. We tested the following 3 combinations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">           h ice = 1 m, I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 , h ice = 10 m, I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 , h ice = 1 m, I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 .</formula><p>The results of Sections 4, 5 have been obtained with the first combination, while comparison with the two other sets of values is performed in Section 6. Changing thermal inertia is a way to model the ocean mixed layer depth which responds quickly to the climatic forcing. This mixed layer varies on Earth with location and time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Selsis et al. (2013)</ref> studied the effect of changing the thermal inertia of hot planets without atmospheres. They showed that increasing the thermal inertia of the surface of such a planet damped the amplitude of its temperature response to the eccentricity-driven insolation variations. They also showed that increasing thermal inertia introduced a lag of the response of the planet with respect to the insolation variations. Imposing a maximum ice thickness allowed in the model is a way to mimic oceanic transports which limits the growth of ice layers. It influences the time to reach the equilibrium and the eccentricitydriven oscillations (see Section 6).</p><p>Article number, page 3 of 17</p><p>A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Planets and initial conditions</head><p>We computed the climate of water worlds, initially ice-free, receiving a mean flux equal to Earth's (1366 W/m 2 ) on orbits of eccentricity from 0 to 0.9, around stars of luminosity:</p><p>-L = 1 L , corresponding to our Sun with an effective temperature of ∼ 5800 K; -L = 10 −2 L , corresponding to a M-dwarf of 0.25 M with an effective temperature of ∼ 3300 K; -L = 10 −4 L , corresponding to a 500 Myr old brown-dwarf of mass 0.04 M with an effective temperature of ∼ 2600 K.</p><p>Note that we did not take into account in this work the spectral dependance of the stars. For instance, we did not consider that a 10 −4 L star is much redder than a 1 L star. We took into account the different luminosities only by scaling the orbital period of the planets, as explained in the following.</p><p>We considered here planets in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, regardless of their eccentricity. However, a planet orbiting a 1 L star on a circular orbit and receiving a flux of 1366 W/m 2 (i.e. at an orbital distance of 1 au) will not reach a synchronous rotation state in less than the age of the universe. Moreover, if the planet is very eccentric, the probability that it is in synchronous rotation is low. The planet will more likely be either in pseudosynchronization (synchronization at periastron, Hut 1981), or in spin-orbit resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Makarov &amp; Efroimsky 2013)</ref>. The aim of our work was to investigate the effect of eccentricity and luminosity, so we only varied here these two parameters, keeping all others equal. Choosing a synchronous rotation allowed us to have, for a given eccentricity, the exact same insolation evolution for planets orbiting a high luminosity star as a low luminosity star. The obliquity of the planet was assumed to be zero. In all cases, the simulations were run from an initial ice-free state until runaway greenhouse/glaciation occurred or steady states of thermal equilibrium were reached.</p><p>For the different eccentricities, we scaled the orbital period of the planet (the duration of the "year") to insure that the planet receives F ⊕ = 1366 W/m 2 on average. A planet of semi-major axis a and eccentricity e receives an averaged flux over one orbit of:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">F = L 4πa 2 √ 1 − e 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where L is the luminosity of the star. In our study, we assume that the planet receives on average F ⊕ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F = F ⊕ = L 4πa 2 ⊕ = 1366 W/m 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where a ⊕ = 1 au.

For example, a planet around a Sun-like star with an eccentricity of 0.6 and receiving 1366 W/m 2 on average has a semi-major axis of 1.119 au. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the different values of the semi-major axis of the planets for different eccentricities, as well as the distances of periastron and apoastron, and the fluxes the planet receives at these distances for L = L . <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the planets' orbit characteristics for L = 10 −2 L and L = 10 −4 L . Since we consider synchronous planets, we can deduce the rotation period of the planets depending on the eccentricity and the type of the star. For a star of L = 1 L and a planet on a circular orbit, the year is 365 days long and the planet has a slow rotation. If the planet is on a very eccentric orbit (e = 0.9), then the semi-major axis is 1.516 au, the year is 681 days long and the planet has an even slower rotation. For a star of L = 10 −4 L and a planet on a circular orbit, the semi-major is 0.01 au, the year is ∼ 2 days long (∼ 4 days for e = 0.9) and the planet has a faster rotation.</p><p>Besides, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Selsis et al. (2013)</ref>, because of the optical libration due to the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, there is no permanent dark area on a planet with an eccentricity higher than 0.72. We define here the dayside as the hemisphere which is illuminated when the planet has an eccentricity of 0. For this case, the substellar point is at 0 • longitude and 0 • latitude, and the dayside extends to -90 • to 90 • in longitude and -90 • to 90 • in latitude. The nightside is the other side of the planet, i.e. from 90 • to 270 • in longitude and -90 • to 90 • in latitude. We use this geographic definition of the dayside and nightside independently of the eccentricity of the orbit.</p><p>We will first discuss the effect of varying the star luminosity on the climate of planets on circular orbits (Section 4), then we will extend the discussion to planets on eccentric orbits (Section 5).</p></div>

The mean surface temperature needs about ∼ 1500 days to reach its equilibrium, which is about 267 K. As the planet is in synchronous rotation, the dayside is much hotter than the nightside <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>, top left). The temperatures on the dayside reach 320 K at the substellar point, whereas temperatures on the nightside are around 240 K. From an initially free water ocean, an ice cap is formed in a few hundred years ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, top right). About 62% of the planet is covered with ice, 38% of the ocean remains free of ice around the substellar point. We obtain the same kind of features as an eyeball planet (like in Pierrehumbert 2011; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wordsworth et al. 2011</ref>, for GJ 581d). Evaporation occurs on a ring around the substellar point ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, bottom right), and there is a lot of precipitation at the substellar point due to humidity convergence and condensation of moisture along the ascending branch of an Hadley type cell ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, bottom left).</p></div>

In our model, the cloud ice particules have a size varying depending on the water mixing ratio (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. 2013</ref> for details). In Yang et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2013)</ref>  Surface temperature strongly depends on the oceanic transport, that is not included here.

This parametrization leads to a lower cloud cover, and thus a lower albedo. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the dayside and nightside mean profiles of temperature, water ice and water vapor in the atmosphere. These mean profiles were obtained by performing a time average over one orbital period 2 . The surface dayside temperatures are higher than the surface nightside temperatures.

On the dayside, water ice clouds are located around an altitude of ∼ 15 km (∼ 90 mbar), while on the nightside, there are no water ice clouds in the atmosphere. The concentration of water vapor is much higher on the dayside than on the nightside.

This mechanism has been identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yang et al. (2013)</ref> to allow the inner edge of the insolation HZ for synchronous planets to be closer than for non-synchronous planets. As a conclusion, over its orbit, a synchronized planet on a circular orbit around a 1 L star has therefore always a part of its ocean ice-free on the dayside (around the substellar point), while its nightside is covered by an ice cap.</p></div>

This is due to the higher Coriolis force that strengthens the mechanisms responsible for the equatorial super-rotation. Both the wave-mean flow interaction identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Showman &amp; Polvani (2011)</ref> and the three-way force balance identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Showman et al.

For 1 L , the wind is weak and isotropically transports heat away from the substellar point (stellar/antistellar circulation, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. 2013</ref>, for a slowly rotating Gl-581c). However, for 10 −2 L , the wind is stronger, especially the longitudinal component, and redistribute more efficiently heat towards the east. Due to this stronger wind, there is an asymmetry of the surface temperature distribution on the planet, so that the east is hotter than the west and the temperature is more homogeneous along the equator. The planet orbiting a 10 −2 L star is colder at the poles (surface temperature of ∼ 235 K) than for 1 L star (surface temperature of ∼ 250 K). The wind pattern here is marked by the presence of a Rossby wave typical of the Rossby wave transition region (as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carone et al. 2015</ref>, for tidally locked planets). In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carone et al. (2015)</ref>, the Rossby wave transition region for a Earth-size planet is said to occur for a rotation period of 25 day, which is approximately the rotation period here (22.85 day). In the 1 L case, the rotation period was much longer and no Rossby wave could develop (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, for 10 −2 L , the averaged ice density is similar to the one of the planet orbiting a 1 L star. However, due to the asymmetric surface temperature map due to the Coriolis force, the shape of the ice-free region is slightly different. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the shape of the surface ice density for L = 10 −2 L    (top panel). Although the percentage of ice-free region remains the same, the ocean for 10 −2 L reaches slightly lower latitudes and is more extended longitudinally than for 1 L .</p><p>Despite these small changes with respect to the case 1 L , a planet on a circular orbit around a 10 −2 L star is therefore equally capable to sustain surface liquid water.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">4.2.2. L = 10 −4 L</formula><p>For an even less luminous host body, the differences that were appearing for the case L = 10 −2 L are accentuated. The temperature maps and surface ice density maps show a more longitudinal extension than before. Due to the even higher rotation rate of the planet (rotation period of 2 day, see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), the winds are redistributing heat longitudinally from the substellar point, heating up efficiently the nightside of the planet. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> shows that the winds are much stronger for the case 10 −4 L (∼ 50 m/s vs ∼ 25 m/s for 10 −2 L and &lt; 10 m/s for 10 −4 L ) and redistribute very efficiently the heat along the equator. In this case, we notice the presence of longitudinal wind jets at latitudes of 45 • S and 45 • N and at a pressure level of ∼ 30 mbar. The wind velocity in the jets can reach almost 120 km/h. As the rotation period is of ∼ 2 day, the criteria for the Rossby wave to be triggered is met and super-rotation takes place <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Showman &amp; Polvani 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leconte et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carone et al. 2015</ref>). As for 10 −2 L , the colder regions are the poles, but their temperature is here even lower (a surface temperature about 20 K lower than for 10 −2 L ). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows that this super-rotation also causes a longitudinal uniformisation of the temperature, water ice clouds and water vapor distribution. Indeed, the nightside temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere for 10 −4 L is not as low as for 1 L and 10 −2 L , and there are much more ice clouds and water vapor on the nightside for 10 −4 L than for 1 L and 10 −2 L .</p><p>Let us note that the evolution of the surface ice density is less quick than in the previous two cases, for which in less than a few decades the surface ice density reaches its equilibrium. Here a few thousands days are needed to reach equilibrium. One of the main difference it implies is an initially lower surface ice density for planets around L = 10 −4 L stars than for more luminous objects. First, the ocean free region survives and forms a belt around the equator with the belt buckle at substellar point. As the eastward wind is losing heat, the eastern regions are hotter than the western regions. After about 700 days of evolution, the ice forms a bridge at 120 • west, closing the equatorial ocean. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows that, when the equilibrium is reached, the shape of the ocean for L = 10 −4 L is very different from the ones of the other two luminosities. When the equilibrium is reached, we find that this planet has an ice-free ocean of a similar size as the previous cases: about 40% of the planet is ice-free. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the mean surface evolution and mean ice density evolution for planets around the three different host stars. For the circular orbits, we can see that the mean surface temperature is higher for L = 10 −4 L than for L = 1 L and L = 10 −2 L . This is due to the strong winds in the atmosphere of the planet, which chase the clouds that are forming above the substellar point. Without the cloud protection, the surface temperature increases. For a tidally locked planet orbiting very low luminosity objects, the longitudinal winds are strong and the stabilizing cloud feedback identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yang et al. (2013)</ref> is less efficient. Therefore, one might expect that the HZ of tidally locked planets around very low luminosity stars is not as extended as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yang et al. (2013)</ref>. However, simulations for higher incoming flux should be performed to verify this claim, in particular to see how the albedo varies with increasing incoming flux.</p><p>Article number, page 7 of 17 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Eccentric orbits</head><p>As described in Section 3.2, we made sure that all planets receive on average the same flux as Earth. Increasing the eccentricity changes significantly the insolation the planet receives over one orbit and it leads to changes in general characteristics of the climate. The insolation varies over the orbit and the substellar point moves along the equator due to the optical libration. Temperature, atmospheric water ice, atmospheric water vapor and surface ice are influenced by this forcing, as shown in the following. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows an example of the evolution, during two orbits, of the mean surface temperature and mean ice thickness for planets on a circular orbit and planets with an eccentricity of 0.2 and 0.4, orbiting the three different kinds of object. The mean surface temperature oscillates with the change of insolation over the orbit. As the orbital period changes with the luminosity and eccentricity (see <ref type="table">Tables 2 and 3)</ref>, it oscillates with different frequency and amplitude for the different cases. This oscillation of insolation and thus temperature has an effect on the amount of water vapor and surface ice (as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). We discuss in the following sections how it has an impact on the climate of the planets considered here and the presence of liquid water at their surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Luminosity of L = 1 L</head><p>First, we consider a luminosity of the star similar to the luminosity of the Sun. Firstly, for small eccentricities, our simulations show surface temperature oscillations, ice density and water vapor oscillations. However, they remain small enough for the planet to keep surface liquid water. For example, a planet on an orbit of eccentricity 0.2 experiences temperature oscillations on the dayside of about 30 K in 371 days, while the mean temperature oscillations are of about 12 K (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). The surface ice density responds accordingly with the eccentricitydriven seasonal melting and freezing. On average, the surface ice density varies between ∼ 58% after the passage at periastron and ∼ 66% after the passage at apoastron. The region around the substellar point is always ice-free but the center of the ice-free region shifts on the surface of the planet by about 10 • during the orbit.</p><p>Secondly, when we increase the eccentricity to 0.4, the amplitude of the variations is higher. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows that the mean temperature variations increase from ∼ 12 K for an eccentricity of e = 0.2 to ∼ 23 K for an eccentricity of e = 0.4. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> also shows that the amplitude of the mean ice density variations of the planet also increases with the eccentricity. The planet's surface ice density after periastron is lower than previously (∼ 55% vs. ∼ 58%), but is much bigger after apoastron (∼ 80% vs. ∼ 66%). The planet is never completely frozen during its evolution since an ice-free region always survives even after the passage at apoastron. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref> shows the mean profiles of temperature, water ice and water vapor in the atmosphere for different eccentricities. For non zero eccentricities, the different quantities are plotted around apoastron and around periastron <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . When the eccentricity increases, the apoastron and periastron profiles depart more from the circular mean profile. At apoastron, the temperature profile is colder than for e = 0. There are less ice water clouds in the atmosphere and they are located closer to the surface. There is also less water vapor in the atmosphere. On the contrary, at periastron, the temperature profile is <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Evolution over two orbits of the mean surface temperature and the mean ice thickness of a planet orbiting a 1 L star (L00, green), a 10 −2 L star (L02, blue) and a 10 −4 L (L04, red) star on an orbit of eccentricity 0.0 (e00), 0.2 (e02) and 0.4 (e04). Note that the orbital periods are different for each case (see <ref type="table">Tables 2 and 3).</ref> hotter, there are much more clouds located higher in the atmosphere and there is also more water vapor in the atmosphere. For an eccentricity of 0.4, the water vapor concentration in the upper atmosphere can reach a few 10 −7 kg/m 2 , which is about 7000 times more that the water vapor concentration on Earth at the same altitude ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Butcher et al. 1992</ref>). Due to the passage at periastron where the planet can receive up to 2.5 times the insolation flux of the Earth, the water vapor peaks in the high atmosphere (pressure &lt; 1 mbar) for about 200 days above 10 −8 kg/m 2 , and for about 30 days above 10 −7 kg/m 2 . There is more water in the upper atmosphere for a planet on an orbit of eccentricity 0.4 than there is in the upper atmosphere of a planet on a circular orbit.</p><p>We thus expect atmospheric loss to be more important for a planet on an eccentric orbit than a planet on a circular orbit. This process happens faster at periastron where the star-planet distance is shorter, which also coincides with the moment when  the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere is higher. We thus expect a larger atmospheric escape rate at periastron. However, as atmospheric escape happens on very long timescales, it might be sensitive only to averaged value of the water vapor concentration, the difference of water vapor concentration at periastron or apoastron could not matter. Thirdly, for eccentricities higher than 0.6, the planet is completely frozen around apoastron (corresponding to a mean ice thickness of 1 m, our value of h ice .). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the evolution of the mean ice thickness for the three different host bodies. For an eccentricity of 0.6, the orbital period is 432 days and the planet spends ∼ 100 days in a completely frozen state, which corresponds to about 20% of its orbital period. When the planet gets closer to the periastron, the ice starts melting at a longitude of 60 • West and liquid water is again available on the dayside around periastron. However the water vapor concentration becomes very high and the surface temperature also increases to more than 300 K. As a conclusion, for planets with an eccentricity less than 0.6, the planet is always able to sustain surface liquid water. The ice-free region changes and shifts as the planet revolves around the star but never disappears. For planets with an eccentricity above 0.6, the planet cannot sustain surface liquid water during the whole orbital period. Let us note that for very high eccentricities and around periastron, the temperatures become higher than what the model allows us (&gt; 400 K). The mean flux approximation is therefore less valid for planets orbiting Sun-like stars on very high eccentricity orbits. However, departing from our definition of habitability based on sea-ice cover, we could speculate about how a potential life formed on such a planet would survive this succession of frozen winters around apoastron and hot summers around periastron. mean ice thickness (mm) Time (day) <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Luminosity of L = 10 −2 L</head><p>For a planet orbiting a 10 −2 L star with an eccentricity of 0.2, the dayside experiences temperature fluctuations of ∼ 40 K in about 23 days. It is of the same order of magnitude as for a 1 L star, but the fluctuation happens on a much shorter timescale. Recall that decreasing the luminosity was done by decreasing the orbital period (the planets have to be closer to receive a flux of 1366 W/m 2 ), and as the planets are synchronized, the rotation period decreases as well (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). We did not take into account the spectral dependance of the low luminosity stars.</p><p>However, the oscillations of the average quantities have a much smaller amplitude than for 1 L . Indeed, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows that the amplitudes of oscillations of mean surface temperature and mean ice thickness are significantly damped when decreasing the luminosity from 1 L to 10 −2 L . Due to the shorter orbital period, the frequency of the forcing is higher than for the case 1 L and the oscillations in the mean temperature, mean ice thickness, and mean water vapor concentration have a lower amplitude. The climate has indeed less time to react to the insolation forcing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> shows the mean atmospheric temperature profile for a planet at periastron and apoastron of an orbit of eccentricity 0.4 around the different kinds of object. The difference between apoastron and periastron is important for the case 1 L with a difference of about 40 K at pressure level of 800 mbar. However, for 10 −2 L the difference is negligible: a few kelvins from a pressure level of 800 mbar to 50 mbar and in the upper atmosphere (pressure &lt; 1 mbar). This shows the slowness of the climate to respond to the higher-frequency forcing. Decreasing the luminosity has the effect of pushing the limit of liquid water presence towards higher eccentricities. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows that a planet with an eccentricity of 0.6 orbiting a 10 −2 L star can always sustain surface liquid water whereas it cannot do so for the whole orbital period if it orbits a 1 L star.</p><p>For an eccentricity of 0.8, the planet passes by a complete frozen state around apoastron and partially melts around periastron so that for about ten days (∼ 1/3 of the orbit), there is a small ice-free oblong region.

Just before periastron, i.e. after the long eccentricity-induced winter, the region that was ice-free around periastron freezes but the ice layer depth does not reach the maximum value of 1 m (see top panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). However, for an eccentricity of 0.9, the planet rapidly becomes completely frozen. This state is reached at the first passage at apoastron, where the planet freezes completely with 1 m of ice covering the whole planet and melts partially around periastron. However, even around periastron there is always a thin layer of ice covering the whole planet.</p><p>As a result, we find that planets orbiting a 10 −2 L star can always sustain surface liquid water on the dayside for higher eccentricities than for a 1 L star (up to 0.8, instead of 0.6). For an eccentricity of 0.8 and higher, the planet remains completely frozen. All in all, the climate simulations are more in agreement with the mean flux approximation for planets orbiting 10 −2 L stars. This is due to the averaging of the climate caused by the quicker rotation. However, departing from our definition of habitability based on sea-ice cover, we could speculate about how a potential life form on such a planet would survive this rapid succession of frozen winters and hot summers (several tens of Kelvins in only ∼ 20 days).</p></div>

As the duration of the year is very short (2 to 4 days, as specified in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), there is therefore a more effective averaging of the mean surface temperature and ice thickness than for longer orbital period planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> shows the mean temperature profile for planets at periastron and apoasArticle number, page 10 of 17 Emeline Bolmont, et al.: Habitability of planets on eccentric orbits tron of an orbit of eccentricity 0.4. For the case 10 −4 L , there is no difference between periastron and apoastron. The shape of the surface ice density also changes when the luminosity decreases. For 10 −2 L , the ice-free region has a oblong shape, for 10 −4 L it has a more peanut shape due to the passage at periastron. The mean ice thickness for L = 10 −4 L is similar to the two previous cases but does not significantly vary over time (see <ref type="figure">Figure  7</ref>). We find that planets orbiting a 10 −4 L star remain always capable to sustain surface liquid water on the dayside throughout the orbit up to very high eccentricities (0.9, instead of 0.8 for 10 −2 L and 0.6 for 1 L ), due to the efficient averaging of the climate brought up by the rapid rotation. The mean flux approximation is therefore valid for small luminosities. However, for an eccentricity of 0.8, the dayside temperature varies over ∼ 50 K, between 300 K and 350 K in less than 4 days. This situation is very extreme for potential life so that the question remains of how life could appear in such an unstable environment.</p></div>

The time needed to reach the equilibrium does not change significantly when increasing the thermal inertia of the ocean from 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 to 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 but, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows, it increases when increasing the ice thickness from 1 m to 10 m. Indeed, as the model is allowed to create thicker ice layers, more time is needed to reach the equilibrium ice thickness.</p><p>For planets orbiting a 1 L star on a circular orbit, changing the thermal inertia does not influence the overall evolution. The mean surface temperature evolves similarly for both thermal inertia and the equilibrium value is slightly higher for I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 . The ice is more present for I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 than for I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 . When increasing the eccentricity, the main difference is that the oscillation amplitude in mean surface temperature and mean ice thickness is lower for I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 . For an eccentricity of 0.4, the mean surface temperature fluctuations amplitude is divided by two when multiplying the thermal inertia by two.</p><p>With a higher thermal inertia, the oceans can damp the climate fluctuations more efficiently. Although the temperature fluctuations on the dayside of the planet are still important, the extent of the ocean varies less with I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 than with I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 , which makes it an environment more stable for potential life. However, this higher thermal inertia of the oceans does not prevent the planet to be completely frozen for very eccentric orbits. For example, for e = 0.8, the planet freezes completely at apoastron.</p><p>For planets orbiting a 10 −2 L star on a circular orbit, the results are similar to the case 1 L . However, the damping of the oscillations amplitude is not as pronounced. Due to the faster rotation of the planet and the more efficient heat redistribution, the planet climate's is more averaged and is less sensitive to the difference in thermal inertia.</p><p>Increasing the thermal inertia of the ocean allows for the climate to have less extreme variations. Following our definition of habitability, changing the thermal inertia of the oceans does not  influence the results. While the planet is able to sustain surface liquid water on the dayside for I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 , it still can do so for I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 . While the planet is only able to temporally sustain surface liquid water on the dayside around periastron for I oc = 18000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 , it is also the case I oc = 36000 J s −1/2 m −2 K −1 .</p><p>For planets orbiting a 1 L star on a circular orbit, changing the maximum ice thickness, h ice , allowed in the model does change neither the equilibrium temperature of the planet (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>), nor the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, nor the geographical repartition ocean-ice. However, more time is needed to reach the equilibrium because a thicker ice-layer has to be created.</p><p>For eccentric orbits, the eccentricity-driven oscillations of mean surface temperature and mean water vapor content are not damped with respect to the case h ice = 1 m. However, the shape of the ocean free zone remains very similar throughout the eccentric orbit. The ice layer on the border of the ice-free zone located in the western and eastern regions, which receives a strong insolation when the planet passes by periastron, has time to only partially melt down. The ice-free zone is therefore smaller than for h ice = 1 m.</p></div>

If this angle is negative then the cell is not on the observable hemisphere of the planet and we set µ lon,lat = 0. In practice we use a suite of tools developed by Selsis et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(2011)</ref> that can visualize maps of the emitted/scattered fluxes and produce time-or phase-dependent disk-integrated spectra at the spectral resolution of the GCM. In addition to the inclination of the system, the orbital lightcurve of an eccentric planet depends also on the orientation of the orbit relative to the observer. Here we consider only observers in the plane of the orbit that see the planet in superior conjunction (full dayside) either at periastron or apoastron. In these configurations, a transit occurs at inferior conjunction and an eclipse at superior conjunction although these events are not included here. As shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Selsis et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Selsis et al. ( , 2013</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Mau- rin et al.

At an inclination of 0 • (polar observer), the phase angle is constant and the lightcurve is only modulated by the change of orbital distance. In general, the obliquity also introduces a seasonal modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gaidos &amp; Williams 2004</ref>) but all our cases have a null obliquity. In this article we only describe observables obtained for the 1 L case. The idea is more to illustrate the connection between climate and observables rather than to prepare the characterization of Earth-like planets around Sunlike stars, as no forthcoming instrument will be able to provide such data. JWST, on the other hand, may be able to obtain (at a large observing-time cost) some data for terrestrial habitablezone planets around cool host-dwarfs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cowan et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tri- aud et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Belu et al. 2013</ref>).

At short wavelengths, this substellar cloudy area is on the contrary the most reflective region due to the scattering by clouds (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). -As the modeled planet has a null obliquity and is locked in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, external forcing is constant at any given point on the planet. The 3D structure of the planet that influences the emerging fluxes is not, however, constant. Clouds in particular produce stochastic meteorological phenomena that induce variations in the observables. The amplitude of this variability is shown in Figure13 for one visible band and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> for 3 infrared bands probing different levels: the surface (11 µm), the lower and mid-atmosphere (6.7 µm, H 2 O band), and upper layers (15 µm, CO 2 band).</p><p>-The CO 2 absorption band at 15 µm band is the most noticeable spectral feature but it exhibits no phase-variation. This is due to the fact that the atmospheric layers emitting to space in this band (∼50-80 mbar) are efficiently homogenized by circulation. This can be seen in <ref type="figure">Fig 2:</ref> the mean day and night thermal profiles are nearly identical in the range 400-20 mbar and clouds (on the dayside) do not extend at altitudes above the 100 mbar layer. -Most of the cooling occurs within the 9-13 µm atmospheric window, which is transparent down to the surface in the absence of clouds, and between 16 and 24 µm, a domain affected by a significant H 2 O absorption increasing with the wavelength. In the 9-13 µm atmospheric window, most of the emission takes place on the cloud-free ring of the dayside. Except for the cloudy substellar region, the brightness temperature in this window is close to the surface temperature and thus goes from an average of around 270-280 K on the dayside down to 240-250 K on the nightside. In this window, the orbital lightcurve therefore peaks at superior conjunction, as we can see in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. -At thermal wavelengths absorbed by water vapor (5-7 µm and above 16 µm) most of the emission takes place on the nightside, producing light curves that peak at inferior conjunction. The 6.7 µm and 11 µm lightcurves in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> are therefore in phase opposition. On the dayside, the large columns of water vapor result in a high altitude, and therefore cold, 6.7 µm photosphere (around 200 mbar, 240 K). On the nightside, the 6.7 µm photosphere is the surface due to the low humidity (around 270-280 K).</p><p>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Yang et al. (2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gómez-Leal (2013)</ref> noted that the wavelength-integrated emitted and scattered light have opposed phase variations. We also find this behavior because the emission at λ &gt; 16 µm represents the larger part of the bolometric cooling, as we can see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. However, the emission in the 9-13 µm atmospheric band carries a significant fraction of the bolometric emission and does peak at superior conjunction as reflected light does. A broadband that includes both spectral regions (9-13 and 16-25 µm) therefore mixes two opposite phase variations while distinguishing between these two domains of the thermal emission could provide strong constrains on the nature of the atmosphere. Although this should be explored further, this opposite phase variations between the 9-13 and 16-25 µm intervals may be a strong sign of both synchronization and the massive presence of water. Adequate filters at thermal wavelength could be used to exploit this signature while maximizing the S/N.</p></div>

Because the maximum eccentricity of an observed possiblyrocky planet is only 0.27 (see Section 1), we choose to show our cases up to an eccentricity of e = 0.4. Several features can be noted:</p><p>-The emission in the 15 µm CO 2 band remains phaseindependent due to efficient heat redistribution at altitudes above the 100 mb layer. As a consequence, the two observation geometries produce the same lightcurve, which variations are only in response to the change of orbital distance (with some lag due to the inertia of the system). This is particularly noticeable in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>.</p><p>-The phase opposition that exists in the circular case between the scattered light and the emission in the 8-12 µm atmospheric window on the one hand and the emission in the 16-25 µm water vapor window on the other hand disappears at e = 0.4 and is hardly seen at e = 0.2 except when the superior conjunction appears at apoastron (second panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>). This can be explained by the strong periastron warming that generates a cloudiness that covers a larger fraction of the sunlit hemisphere and persists on the nightside. These clouds hence decrease the infrared cooling in the atmospheric window on the dayside. -Another effect of this large cloud coverage is to spread the observed scattered light over a broader range of phase angles, with no peak at superior conjunction when it occurs at apoastron. This can be seen on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> and 15.</p></div>

As we only consider cases with a 90 • inclination, the reflected flux is always null at inferior conjunction (transit). The reflected variation spectrum naturally depends on the eccentricity as the closest the planet approaches its hot star, the highest its reflected brightness (for a given albedo). The thermal variation spectrum shows, on the other hand, an overall minor dependency on the eccentricity. The amplitude of the differences in thermal flux does increase slightly with eccentricity but the differences between one eccentricity to another are not significantly higher than those induced by stochastic meteorological changes from one orbit to another. One exception is the amplitude of the variations in the 15 µm band, which increases notably with the eccentricity, from basically no variations at e = 0 to a factor of 2 variation at e = 0.2 and a factor of 5 at e = 0.4.</p></div>

This could be done with either of these two values if knowing the planetary radius and the incoming stellar flux, or from the LW/SW ratio without any other information. These estimates would however be biased by the observing geometry and emission/reflection anisotropies. We therefore tested how these measured values of the Bond albedo depart from its actual value. The actual Bond albedo calculated from the simulations as well as those that can be estimated by an observer are given in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>. We can see that the error is typically of the order of 10-20%, with a slight tendency to overestimate the Bond albedo. This is due to the fact that the reflected light is more focused into the orbital plane than the thermal emission, which is redistributed by circulation. A polar observer may on the contrary underestimate the Bond albedo.</p></div>

Taking this phenomenon into account would radically change the ice-albedo feedback, so that for redder objects it would not be able to drive the planets into a glaciation state (such as what we showed here for planets with high eccentricities around a L = 10 −2 L star). <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Godolt et al.

Our results would also be likely to change if we had considered other types of planets such as an Earth-like planet, a land planet, a planet with a Pangea-like continent, a planet with archipelagos (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Yang et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Besides, we consider here a planet whose atmosphere has a composition very similar to the Earth's composition.

First, tides act to damp the eccentricities of planets, so that a planet with an eccentricity of 0.8 would not keep its eccentricity forever (the timescale of eccentricity damping depending on many parameters such as the orbital parameters, the mass, radius and composition of the planet; e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mignard 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hut 1981)</ref>. However, a high eccentricity could be maintained if the planet is part of a multi-planet system. Indeed the gravitational interactions between the planets can contribute in exciting the eccentricity of the planet on long timescales. Second, such high eccentricities can be responsible for tidal heating in the interior of the planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jackson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolmont et al. 2014</ref>). This tidal heating is all the more important as we consider planets orbiting low luminosity objects. Indeed, a planet around a less luminous star and receiving the same average flux as Earth is much closer to its host star and thus susceptible to a higher tidal heating. This effect should be studied, as tidal heating could contribute significantly to the energy budget of the planet (and create "tidal Venuses" as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes et al. 2009</ref>). Third, tides also influence the rotation state of the planet. We considered here tidally locked planets, but planets on eccentric orbits are more likely to have a pseudo-synchronous rotation (synchronization around periastron, see Hut 1981) or to be in spin-orbit resonance (the higher the eccentricity, the higher the order of the resonance, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Makarov &amp; Efroimsky 2013)</ref>. The pseudo-synchronous rotation and the spin-orbit resonance are faster than the synchronous rotation, so the wind will be even more efficient to redistribute the heat on the planet. Finally, even for a circular orbit, atmospheric tides can drive a planet out of synchronization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Correia et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Leconte et al. 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we focused only on the presence of surface liquid water without having to conclude about the actual potential of the planets to be appropriate environments for the apparition of life.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusions</head><p>Thanks to climate simulations of synchronous ocean covered planets, we are able to assess their potential habitability in the sense of their capacity to host a liquid water ocean at their surface. We investigated whether the mean flux approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Williams &amp; Pollard 2002</ref>) is correct to assess the habitability of eccentric planets orbiting stars of different luminosity. In order to do so, we considered planets receiving on average the same flux as Earth and modeled their climates for different eccentricities and different orbital periods (used here as a proxy for the three different star luminosities we considered: 1 L , 10 −2 L , 10 −4 L ).</p><p>We found that tidally locked water worlds can sustain surface liquid water only on the dayside. For all luminosities and only small eccentricities, all the planets considered can always sustain surface liquid water on the dayside. Planets orbiting the less luminous objects considered here (10 −4 L ) can always sustain surface liquid water whatever is the eccentricity.</p><p>However, planets on high eccentricity orbits around luminous objects can only sustain surface liquid water around periastron. This is the case for planets orbiting a 1 L star with an eccentricity higher than 0.6, planets orbiting a 10 −2 L star with an eccentricity higher than 0.8 and planets orbiting a 10 −4 L star with an eccentricity higher than 0.9. For exemple, we find that a planet orbiting a 10 −2 L star with an eccentricity of 0.9 cannot have surface liquid water, it always has an ice layer covering the whole planet. Besides, for planets with high eccentricities, the dayside temperature variations over a period of 365 days (1 L ) to 4 days (10 −4 L ) can be huge (up to 100 K). This could have detrimental consequences for eventual life forms. For the planets considered here, i.e. water worlds planets for which the surface is treated as an infinite water source, tidally locked and with no obliquity, we found that the higher the eccentricity of the planet or the higher the luminosity of the star, the less reliable the mean flux approximation. These results are not in agreement with the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Williams &amp; Pollard (2002)</ref>, which assessed that the mean flux approximation is valid for all eccentricities. When considering L = 1 L , we draw similar conclusions to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Linsenmeier et al. (2015)</ref>, who pointed out that planets on eccentric orbits around a Sun-like star can be frozen during part of the year.</p><p>We explored the parameter space of our model by changing the thermal inertia of the ocean and the maximum ice layer thickness. Changing those parameters in the model does not change significantly the conclusions above.</p><p>Article number, page 16 of 17 Emeline Bolmont, et al.: Habitability of planets on eccentric orbits</p><p>We will address in a future work the limits discussed in the previous section, in particular the spectral difference between low mass stars and the Sun, the distribution of continents and tidal effects.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
