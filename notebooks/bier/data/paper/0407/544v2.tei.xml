			<abstract>
				<p>Exoplanets host stars present a clear metallicity excess compared to stars without detected planets, with an average overabundance of 0.2 dex. This excess may be primordial, in which case the stars should be overmetallic down to their center, or it may be due to accretion in the early phases of planetary formation , in which case the stars would be overmetallic only in their outer layers. In the present paper, we show the differences in the internal structure of stars, according to the chosen scenario. Namely two stars with the same observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical composition) are completely different in their interiors according to their past histories, which we reconstitute through the computations of their evolutionary tracks. It may happen that stars with an initial overmetallicity have a convective core while the stars which suffered accretion do not. We claim that asteroseismic studies of these exoplanets host stars can give clues about their internal structures and metallicities, which may help in understanding planetary formation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Since the historical discovery of the first exoplanet by Mayor et al 1995, more than one hundred and fifteen of these objects have presently been detected ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mayor 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Santos et al 2004</ref>. Due to technical limitations, the systems which have been observed are quite different from the solar system. They usually consist in a solar-type star surrounded by one or several Jupiter-like planets, orbiting at a short distance of the parent star.</p><p>A striking observation about exoplanets host stars concerns their metallicities which, on the average, are larger than those of stars without detected planets, by 0.2 dex (e.g.</p><p>Send offprint requests to: M. Bazot <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gonzalez 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, Gonzalez 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Murray et al. 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Martell &amp; Laughlin 2002</ref>. The origin of this overmetallicity is still a subject of debate and is directly related to the process of planetary formation.</p><p>Two extreme scenarios have been proposed to account for this observed overmetallicity : we discuss them separately although it is not excluded that they both occur together in the same stars. The first one assumes that the stellar systems with planets were formed out of an already metal-rich protostellar gas (see <ref type="bibr">Santos et al. 2004</ref> for a recent review on the subject). The subjacent idea is that a larger metallicity helps forming planets as it implies a larger density of grains and more frequent collisions among heavy particles. As a consequence it becomes easier for planetesimal to form and accrete matter (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pollack et al. 1996)</ref> The second scenario assumes no difference of metallicity in the protostellar gas. In this case the metallicity excess would be due to the accretion of newly formed planets in the early phases : due to their interaction with the disk, the planets may migrate towards the star and eventually fall on it. Evidences of planet migration come from the mere observation of giant planets close to the central stars : the formation scenarios assume that they have been formed further away and have spiralled down due to their interaction with the disk (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Trilling et al 1998)</ref>. The basic difficulty is to understand the reason why the migration stops : it must be due to the absence of disk matter close to the star, which may be related to different effects. Within this framework, the accretion of some planets in the early epochs seems quite plausible. It may also be supported by the presence of 6 Li in parent stars <ref type="bibr">(Israelian et al , 2004</ref>). As they are mostly composed of heavy elements, the accretion of these planets should increase the metallicity of the star in its outer layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Murray et al 2001)</ref>. However the number of planets needed to explain an overmetallicity by 0.2 dex is large : a 3M ⊕ terrestrial planet which could explain the 6 Li/ 7 Li ratio in HD82943 would increase the metallic abundance of the star by only ≃ 17% ( <ref type="bibr">Israelian et al 2004)</ref>. Of course this depends on the chemical composition of the planets, but an increase of the metallicity as observed would need that the stars swallow several tens of earths, which is not completely excluded but seems very high.</p><p>A strong argument against the accretion scenario was raised by Santos et al 2001, who pointed out that similar accretion rates on main sequence stars should lead to a metal excess larger for stars with larger masses, as their convective zones are shallower (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pinsonneault et al 2001)</ref>. On the contrary, the observations show similar overmetallicities for stars of various effective temperatures. However this argument did not take into account double-diffusive convection, which should partially mix the accreted matter below the convective zone <ref type="bibr">(Vauclair 2004</ref>). Also accretion could occur before the zero age main sequence, in which case the convective zones are deeper.</p><p>Another argument has been used in favour of the primordial scenario : the existence of a correlation between the frequency of planets and the metallicity ; the more metal rich is the star, the larger is the probability of finding planets in orbit around it (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Santos et al 2004)</ref>. This argument could however be used as a support of the accretion scenario as well : if many planets form around a star, the number of accreted ones is larger and the metallicity higher ; meanwhile the probability for the existence of an observable planet is also larger in this case.</p><p>In the present paper, we suggest to use asteroseismology of exoplanets hosts stars to check whether they are overmetallic down to their center ("overmetallic models") or only in their outer layers ("accretion models"), which may help chosing between the two scenarios and lead to a better understanding of planetary formation.</p><p>Helioseismology has proved to be a powerful tool for solar physics, even for the detection of very small variations in the internal chemical composition (e.g. Bahcall et al 1992,</p><p>Christensen-Dalsgaard et al 1996, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Richard et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, Brun et al 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, Turcotte et al 1998</ref>. Asteroseismology is now taking its turn and is expected to lead to major advances in stellar physics. The technics are different for the stars and for the Sun as the stars are always seen globally while the solar surface can be locally analysed. Contrary to the Sun, only modes with low l-degree values may be detected in stars (from 0 to 3 with the present asteroseismic technics). Even with such low degree modes, important clues can be obtained for the internal structure of the stars. Ground-based and space instruments (ELODIE, HARPS, MOST) are able to observe oscillations of solar-type stars. In the future, more precise observations are still expected from new missions like CoROT and possibly Eddington.</p><p>A good example of such asteroseismic studies is the detection of acoustic modes in αCen A ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouchy &amp; Carrier 2001</ref>) using the ELODIE spectrograph in Haute Provence</p><p>Observatory. Twenty eight modes of low degrees, (l = 0, 1, 2) and radial orders between 15 and 25 were identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bouchy &amp; Carrier 2002)</ref>. These oscillation frequencies were used to provide an accurate description of the internal physics of the star (Thevenin et al 2002, <ref type="bibr">Thoul et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Eggenberger et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>In the present paper, we compute stellar models for the overmetallic and accretion cases, which are iterated so that they converge on the same "observable" parameters (here we use L, T ef f and chemical composition). The stars could not be differentiated by classical observation, but we will show that they are quite different in their internal structure and that the differences can be tested with asteroseismology. </p></div>

Microscopic diffusion was included in all the models as described Evolutionary tracks (including standard pre main-sequence) were computed for stars with initial solar abundances (see table 1) modified by accretion in its outer layers (accretion models) and for stars with initial metallic excess (overmetallic models)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The accretion scenario</head><p>The accretion scenario assumes that the star is overmetallic only in its outer layers. This could be due to planetary material falling onto the star. We do not discuss here detailed scenarios for the accretion of planets, planetesimals or planetary material through evaporation. We assume, for a first approach, that the accreted matter has no hydrogen neither helium, while the other elements are present in solar relative abundances</p><p>(this assumption can be tested by spectroscopy when applied to a real star). Also the accretion process is treated as instantaneous compared to the evolution time scale and is assumed to take place on the ZAMS. Except for hydrogen and helium, we set the surface abundances at the time of zero age main sequence as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X a i = X i (1 + f a )</formula><p>where f a is a free parameter linked to the accreted mass. The hydrogen and helium mass fraction are then recomputed such that their ratio remains unchanged.</p><p>The effect of accretion on a standard model with solar initial abundances is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>. We can see that the models with accretion are cooler than those without accretion which have the same internal abundances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">The primordial scenario</head><p>The primordial scenario assumes that the star and the planets were formed out of initially overmetallic gas. This suggests that interstellar clouds inside the Galaxy may have metallic abundances varying by a factor of order two. We do not know however the helium We can see how accretion moves the tracks towards smaller effective temperatures. In the following we will compare models with the same external chemical composition and different internal structure. abundance in such clouds. A possible assumption would be that it follows the regression law found for extragalactic HII regions, namely :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y = Y p + Z ∆Y ∆Z (1)</formula><p>where Y p is the primordial helium ratio and ∆Y ∆Z the slope of the regression curve obtained from observations <ref type="bibr">(Isotov &amp; Thuan 2004</ref>).</p><p>But the chemical history of intersellar clouds may be different from the overall chemical evolution of galaxies as the average stellar mass fraction may not be the same. In this case it is possible that helium remains solar while the metal abundances increase.</p><p>In the first case, the helium value for a metal increase by a factor 2 compared to the Sun would be Y=0.33 while in the second case it would remain Y=0.27 as in the Sun.</p><p>The two cases have been treated in our computations as two possible extreme values. Thus, to obtain the same external parameters (L, T ef f and metallicity), with the same Y 0 and α, we expect that an overmetallic star will have a larger mass than a star which has suffered accretion. This fact has two major consequences which will be discussed later. First the internal structures of the stars are quite different and can hopefully be distinguished with asteroseismic studies ; second the determination of the masses of exoplanets may have to be reviewed if their host star is heavier than previously assumed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>We have studied two couples of models, each of them with identical outer (observable) parameters : L, T ef f , external chemical composition, but different histories. In each couple, one partner was a model with an overmetallicity down to the stellar center (overmetallic model) while the other partner was a model with normal (solar) composition with an metallicity increase in the external layers due to accretion (accretion model). In the first couple (models OM1 and AC1), the helium value was solar in the two partners, while in the second couple (models OM2 and AC2), the overmetallic model was assumed to have also an increase of helium, according to the Y-Z relation obtained for the chemical evomution of galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Izotov &amp; Thuan 2004</ref>).</p><p>We always considered that the accreted matter contained neither hydrogen nor helium. For the other elements, we assumed solar relative abundances. The accreted mate- rial was supposed to be instantaneously mixed in the convective zone at the beginning of the zero-age-main-sequence. For a first approach, double-diffusive mixing <ref type="bibr">(Vauclair 2004</ref>) was not introduced in the present computations. Models including this effect will be presented in a forthcoming paper.</p><p>We show that their are drastic differences between two models which would appear as the same star from outside, but which have different chemical composition inside.</p><p>The overmetallic models have a larger mass than the accretion models, and the most important differences in their internal structure is that the first ones develop a convective core while the second ones do not. Also the outer convective zones do not have the same depth and there is a metallic gradient below the convective boundary in the accretion models. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 13</ref>. Same as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.12</ref> for models AC2 and OM2.</p><p>We have investigated the possible asteroseismic tests of these differences. We found that the differences in the internal structure lead to signatures in the large separations (the acoustic radii of the stars are different), small separations and second differences.</p><p>While the second differences can give the position of the bottom of the outer convective zone, the most important effect is seen in the ratio of the small to the large separations : an oscillatory behavior clearly related to the presence of the convective core is seen in the overmetallic models and does not exist in the accretion models.</p><p>These first results are very encouraging and we may hope to be able to derive, by observing real central stars of planetary systems, whether they are overmetallic down to the center or suffered planetary accretion. Such results would be very helpful to understand the formation of planetary systems.   Rogers, F.

The boundary of the convective core induces a sharp variation in the sound velocity which leads to a partial reflexion of the waves which would otherwise travel down to the stellar center. Roxburgh &amp; Vorontsov 2001 have computed the oscillatory perturbations which appear in this case in the small separations. They exhibit a modulation with a period close to the acoustic radius of the core (time needed for the waves to travel between the stellar center and the core boundary) (</figDesc></figure>
