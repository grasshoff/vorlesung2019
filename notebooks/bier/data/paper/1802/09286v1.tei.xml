			<abstract>
				<p>Context. Astronomers recently started discovering exoplanets around binary systems. Therefore, understanding the formation and evolution of circumbinary disks and their environment is crucial for a complete scenario of planet formation. Aims. The purpose of this paper is to present the detection of a circumbinary disk around the system Oph-IRS67 and analyse its chemical and physical structure. Methods. We present high-angular-resolution (0. 4, ∼60 AU) observations of C 17 O, H 13 CO + , C 34 S, SO 2 , C 2 H and c−C 3 H 2 molecular transitions with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at wavelengths of 0.8 mm. The spectrally and spatially resolved maps reveal the kinematics of the circumbinary disk as well as its chemistry. Molecular abundances are estimated using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative-transfer tool RADEX. Results. The continuum emission agrees with the position of Oph-IRS67 A and B, and reveals the presence of a circumbinary disk around the two sources. The circumbinary disk has a diameter of ∼620 AU and is well traced by C 17 O and H 13 CO + emission. Two further molecular species, C 2 H and c−C 3 H 2 , trace a higher-density region which is spatially offset from the sources (∼430 AU). Finally, SO 2 shows compact and broad emission around only one of the sources, Oph-IRS67 B. The molecular transitions which trace the circumbinary disk are consistent with a Keplerian profile on smaller disk scales (200 AU) and an infalling profile for larger envelope scales (200 AU). The Keplerian fit leads to an enclosed mass of 2.2 M. Inferred CO abundances with respect to H 2 are comparable to the canonical ISM value of 2.7 × 10 −4 , reflecting that freeze-out of CO in the disk midplane is not significant. Conclusions. Molecular emission and kinematic studies prove the existence and first detection of the circumbinary disk associated with the system Oph-IRS67. The high-density region shows a different chemistry than the disk, being enriched in carbon chain molecules. The lack of methanol emission agrees with the scenario where the extended disk dominates the mass budget in the innermost regions of the protostellar envelope, generating a flat density profile where less material is exposed to high temperatures, and thus, complex organic molecules would be associated with lower column densities. Finally, Oph-IRS67 is a promising candidate for proper motion studies and the detection of both circumstellar disks with higher-angular-resolution observations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Low-mass star formation takes place within dense cold molecular clouds, where individual cores collapse due to gravity. Because of the initial core rotation, conservation of angular momentum will lead to the formation of a circumstellar disk around the young stars. The angular momentum is transferred to the outer regions of the disk and moved outward by energetic outflows, sweeping away material from the envelope. In the earliest stages, the young source is deeply embedded in its infalling envelope of cold gas and dust, obscuring the radiation from the central star. As the system evolves, the envelope dissipates, revealing the pre-main sequence star and the circumstellar disk. The properties and evolution of these disks are crucial for the final mass of the host star and the initial conditions of planetary systems.</p><p>Within the envelope, the large variations in temperature (tens to hundreds of K) and density (10 5 -10 9 cm −3 ) leave strong chemical signatures that can potentially be observed directly, thus making these systems interesting laboratories for astrochemical studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. 2004</ref>). Since individual molecular transitions are enhanced at specific temperatures and densities, their emission (and/or absorption) reveals the peculiarities and characteristics of the gas and can be used to reveal the physical structure and evolution of the young protostar (when the chemistry is taken into account).</p><p>While the overall framework of low-mass star formation is well accepted nowadays, the details are significantly more complex, particularly when the formation of binary and/or multiple systems is considered (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tobin et al. 2016</ref>). Circumstellar disks have been detected around individual binary components, as well as a circumbinary disk surrounding the system for Class I sources. Some cases show an alignment between the disks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dutrey 2015</ref>), while other systems consist of misaligned components (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brinch et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Takakuwa et al. 2017</ref>). For more evolved systems, discrepancies are reported between disk sizes inferred from observations in multiple systems and predictions from tidal interaction models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Harris et al. 2012</ref>). Apart from the physical structure, the chemical differentiation between the younger Class 0 and the more evolved Class I multiple systems provides information about the evolution of important parameters, such as temperature and density. Consequently, more observations are needed in order to understand the complexity of binary and multiple systems.</p><p>With the high angular resolution of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA), smaller scales (10-50 AU) can be resolved towards nearby star-forming regions, providing very detailed observations of the environments in which stars form. One of the closest star-forming regions is the Ophiuchus molecular cloud ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wilking et al. 2008</ref>), characterised by a high visual extinction (A V ) of between 50 and 100 magnitudes, and a high number of solar-type young stellar objects (YSOs) in different evolutionary stages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wilking et al. 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Ophiuchus is therefore one of the most important regions for studies of the star formation process and early evolution of young stars.</p><p>One of the particularly interesting YSOs in Ophiuchus is the proto-binary system IRS67AB, located in the L1689 part of the cloud. This source is also known as L1689SAB and WLY2-67. The distance to IRS67AB and L1689 were recently determined through proper motion and trigonometric parallax measurements by Ortiz- <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">León et al. (2017)</ref>. The distance was determined to be 147.3 ± 3.4 pc to L1689 as a whole and 151.2 ± 2.0 pc to IRS67AB specifically; in this paper, we adopt the latter.</p><p>IRS67AB was associated with a large-scale outflow structure ( 1000 AU), detected in CO J=2−1 emission by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bontemps et al. (1996)</ref>, and was also surveyed at infrared and other wavelengths as part of the Spitzer Space Telescope c2d legacy program ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Evans et al. 2009</ref>). In that survey, the source was associated with a bolometric temperature (T bol ) of 130 K, bolometric luminosity (L bol ) of 4.0 L , infrared spectral index (α IR ) of 1.39 and visual extinction of 9.8 magnitudes, all characteristics of embedded Class I young stellar objects. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McClure et al. (2010)</ref> proved the binary nature of the system (L1689S-A and L1689S-B in their work), through infrared observations, calculated a separation of 0.6 (∼90 AU) between the two sources, and identified sources A and B as a disk and envelope candidate, respectively.</p><p>In this paper, we present ALMA observations of Oph-IRS67AB. The study of this binary system demonstrates the complexity of protoplanetary disk formation and evolution (both circumstellar and circumbinary), from an observational point of view. Section 2 describes the observational procedure, data calibration, and covered molecular transitions. In Sect. 3, we present the results, highlighting the detection of the circumbinary disk and the chemical diversity of the system. Section 4 is dedicated to the analysis of the data, where dust and gas masses are calculated, and different velocity profiles are considered for the circumbinary disk. In addition, relative molecular abundances are estimated in order to compare them with values associated with a younger system. We discuss the structure and kinematics of the whole system, and the temperature profile of the circumbinary disk in Sect. 5. Finally, we end the paper with a summary in Sect. 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>IRS67 was observed with ALMA on four occasions between 2015 May 21 and June 5 as part of a larger program to survey the line and continuum emission towards 12 Class I protostars in Ophiuchus (program code: 2013.1.00955.S; PI: Jes Jørgensen). At the time of the observations, 36 antennas were available in the array (37 for the June 5 observations) providing baselines between 21 and 556 metres (784 metres for the June 5 observations). Each of the four sessions provided an on-source time of 43 minutes in total for the 12 different sources (i.e. each source was observed for approximately 15 minutes in total)</p><p>The observations targeted five different spectral windows and the choice of species has been made specifically to trace different aspects of the structure of protostars. For example, the lines of C 17 O, H 13 CO + and C 34 S are optically thin tracers of the kinematics of disk formation, while SO 2 and CH 3 OH are expected to trace the warm chemistry in the inner envelope or disk. Two spectral windows consist of 960 channels, each with 122.07 kHz (0.11 km s −1 ) spectral resolution centred on C 17 O J=3−2 and C 34 S J=7−6, while the other three contain 1920 channels each with 244.14 kHz (0.22 km s −1 ) spectral resolution centred on H 13 CO + J=4−3, the CH 3 OH J k =7 k −6 k branch at 338.4 GHz and the CH 3 CN 14−13 branch at 349.1 GHz. The latter two organic molecules are not detected towards IRS67, but instead the two settings pick up SO 2 , C 2 H, and c−C 3 H 2 transitions. The spectral setup and covered molecular transitions are summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The calibration and imaging were done in CASA 1 <ref type="bibr">(Mc- Mullin et al. 2007</ref>): the complex gains were calibrated through observations of the quasars J1517-2422 and J1625-2527, passband calibration on J1924-2914 and flux calibration on Titan.</p><p>The resulting dataset has a beam size of 0 . 44 × 0 . 33, a continuum rms level of 0.4 mJy beam −1 and a spectral rms level of 10 mJy beam −1 per channel. The channel width can be 0.11 or 0.22 km s −1 , depending on the spectral window (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the submillimetre continuum emission toward Oph-IRS67, where two peaks are detected toward the A and B sources plus a fainter disk-like structure. Oph-IRS67B is brighter than Oph-IRS67A (155 vs. 30 mJy) and was identified by <ref type="bibr">Mc- Clure et al. (2010)</ref> as a binary companion at infrared wavelengths. The disk-like structure has a deconvolved continuum size of (4 . 1 ± 0 . 2) × (0 . 82 ± 0 . 05) or (620 ± 20 AU) × (124 ± 7 AU), and a position angle (PA) of 54 • ± 1 • , measured from north to east. Assuming a toy model for a thin and circular structure, an inclination of ∼ 80 • (i = 0 • for face-on and i = 90 • for edge-on) is found by fixing the major and minor axis values of the deconvolved continuum size.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Continuum emission</head><p>The position and integrated flux of each source are obtained by fitting two-dimensional (2D) Gaussians to both peaks and are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The position of the geometric centre is also calculated, by taking the middle point between both sources. The separation between sources A and B is 0 . 71 ± 0 . 01 (107 ± 2 AU). All the figures and calculations in this work are shown relative to the geometric centre, and relative to the system velocity (V LSR ) of 4.2 km s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lindberg et al. 2017</ref>). The red diamond in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> represents the position of an offset region, that may be  3.2. Molecular emission <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> contains the parameters of the detected molecular transitions. The original proposal aimed at detecting the CH 3 OH J k =7 k -6 k branch, but no significant emission above 3σ is observed. In the case of C 2 H, the four lines compose two pairs of hyperfine splittings of two rotational levels. Since both hyperfine transitions in each pair are very close to one another, the C 2 H transitions are labelled as N=4−3, J=9/2−7/2 and N=4−3, J=7/2−5/2. All the listed species are detected towards at least one of the following regions: source A, source B, the disk-like structure or a region spatially offset from the system (∼430 AU from the geometrical center), located South-West from the continuum emission (red diamond in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Moment maps</head><p>Figures 2 and 3 present the integrated emission (moment 0) and the velocity field (moment 1) for C 17 O, H 13 CO + , C 34 S, the two doublets of C 2 H, both transitions of c−C 3 H 2 , and SO 2 . In moment 0 maps, the continuum emission from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> corresponding to 4 and 15σ contours is also plotted. C 17 O is tracing the disk-like structure, with a strong correlation with the continuum emission and its integrated intensity peaks at the position of source B. The H 13 CO + emission is very intense in the proximity of both sources, showing an S-shape correlated with the continuum emission, and is enhanced in the offset region. C 34 S peaks in isolated regions away from both sources and part of the emission lies beyond the continuum emission. The lines of C 2 H display the most extended emission and their integrated intensity dominates in the offset region. The North-East emission presents a curved shape beyond the continuum emission, while the South-West region is almost completely dominated by C 2 H emission. Close to the protostars, the C 2 H integrated intensity is below 5σ. Both c−C 3 H 2 transitions show extended emission only in the vicinity of the offset region and are anti-correlated with the continuum emission. SO 2 shows compact emission only toward source B, where the continuum emission peaks. The velocity ranges in Figs. 2 and 3 are chosen to bring forward the disk-like structure. For a detailed comparison of the more quiescent gas associated with the individual protostars, see the channel maps in Figs. A.1, A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A. The offset region shows strong emission of the two c−C 3 H 2 transitions. Since these two transitions are associated with high critical densities (n crit = 1.2 × 10 8 and 1.4 × 10 8 cm −3 ; see Table 1), the offset region is henceforth referred to as the high density region.</p><p>The moment 1 maps in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs. 2 and 3</ref> show the existence of a velocity gradient and suggest an approximately edge-on and flat morphology for the disk-like structure, with the blueshifted emission arising from the South-West region and the redArticle number, page 3 of 19 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no.

SO 2 transitions are only seen towards source B and show broad emission (from −8 to 10 km s −1 ), with an intense blue-shifted component and a weaker red-shifted one. One of the CH 3 OH J k =7 k -6 k transitions falls close to a SO 2 line <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5a</ref>), but since no other lines in the CH 3 OH branch are seen, including the lower excitation transitions, the line can clearly be attributed to SO 2 .</p></div>

C 34 S presents an Stype morphology and enhanced emission far away from the binary system, while C 2 H shows the most extended emission and the blue-shifted emission dominates over a wider region than the red-shifted one. Both c−C 3 H 2 transitions show the same behaviour, with intermediate blue-shifted velocities tracing the high-density region and no red-shifted counterpart.</p><p>High velocities are associated with C 17 O and SO 2 , showing compact emission only around Oph-IRS67B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Velocity profiles</head><p>C 17 O and H 13 CO + are the best candidates for studying the velocity profile of the disk-like structure through position-velocity (PV) diagrams, since they are correlated with the continuum emission. The other species are not suitable for studying the velocity profile of the disk-like structure, as they seem to be tracing different material. C 2 H has an important contribution beyond 2 and may be tracing envelope material, while C 34 S is tracing smaller regions from the outer parts of the disk-like structure, and SO 2 emission is unresolved within the beam size. On the other hand, c−C 3 H 2 is tracing the high-density region; its velocity profile is discussed in Sect. 4.1.2.</p><p>In order to obtain the velocity profiles, the peak emission for each channel is obtained through the CASA task imfit. Two fits are considered for high-velocity points (&gt;1.7 km s −1 ): (i) a Keplerian fit where ∝ r −0.5 and (ii) an infalling fit where ∝ r −1 (i.e. infalling motion where the angular momentum is conserved). In all cases, the central (0,0) position corresponds to the location of the geometric centre and the distance increase toward the disk-like structure direction (PA = 234 • ; grey solid arrow in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), assuming an inclination of 80 • .</p></div>

The spectrum of SO 2 does not show a central component but presents blue-and red-shifted emission, thus, a two component Gaussian fit was employed.

The calculated values for τ and column density are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>, and are obtained by assuming a H 2 number density of 1 × 10 7 cm −3 (collision partner), two kinetic temperatures (T kin ) of 30 and 100 K, and a broadening parameter (b) corresponding to the FWHM value of each transition (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 4</ref>). The chosen value for the H 2 number density is related to the average value for the critical densities of the observed transitions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). If we change the H 2 density by a factor of 10, the C 17 O column density remains constant since its level populations are thermalized (the critical density for this transition is 3.5 × 10 4 cm −3 ; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Structure of Oph-IRS67</head><p>The continuum emission <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref> shows the binary system, separated by 0 . 71 ± 0 . 01 (107 ± 2 AU), previously detected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McClure et al. (2010)</ref> at infrared wavelengths. They estimated a separation of 0.6 (∼ 90 AU) between the two sources and found that Oph-IRS67A (L1689S-A) is brighter than Oph-IRS67B (L1689S-B), while the opposite situation is observed in the submillimetre regime. The contrast between the sources at different wavelengths could be due to, (i) different evolutionary stages, i.e. Oph-IRS67A is more evolved than Oph-IRS67B, (ii) different dust grain sizes, (iii) different orientation of possible circumstellar disks, where the one associated with source A may be more face-on and the one related to source B more edge-on, (iv) different temperatures if the sources present distinct masses or one of them displays ongoing accretion bursts or, (v) the two sources lie differently in the circumbinary disk, where source B is more obscured than source A.</p><p>Since close binaries are expected to be coeval systems, options (i) and (ii) are less likely. Option (iii) is supported by SO 2 and C 17 O emission, where both species show compact morphology around source B at high velocities. Such behaviour would be expected for an edge-on circumstellar disk, however this emission can also be related to accretion shocks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Podio et al. 2015</ref>). On the other hand, source A is associated with C 17 O emission at low velocities but no SO 2 emission is observed towards this source. This supports the scenario where a possible circumstellar disk associated with source A is more face-on, where the shift in velocities is not as perceptible as in the edge-on case. Although a perpendicular misalignment between the two sources is statistically unlikely (∼ 2%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Murillo et al. 2016)</ref>, this scenario will be consistent with source A being brighter than source B at infrared wavelengths, where the warm dust in the line of sight is not obscured by the cold dust. Option (iv) is plausible if the sources have different masses, however if one of the sources presents higher temperatures due to accretion bursts, we would expect to detect gas-phase CH 3 OH around it. The arrangement proposed in option (v) agrees with the scenario suggested for IRS 43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brinch et al. 2016)</ref>, where one of the sources lies behind the circumbinary disk and, therefore, is more obscured by the material along the line of sight. In the case of IRS 43, the two continuum sources have the same mass but differ in intensity by a factor of 5−10. For Oph-IRS67 AB, the intensity of the two sources differs by a factor of 5, however there are no constraints on the individual masses.</p><p>The velocity difference between the two sources seen in C 17 O and H 13 CO + <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 4</ref>) is more consistent with emission arising from different regions than radial motion of both sources. If C 17 O and H 13 CO + trace radial motions, a better correlation between the parameters of their Gaussian fits is expected. This does not exclude that both sources are rotating around the centre of mass: indeed, such rotation is expected, but proper motion measurements are necessary to support this interpretation (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brinch et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>At first glance, the weaker emission associated with the disklike structure could be thought to be associated with a circumbinary disk, an inner infalling envelope or an outflow. However, the latter is ruled out since the system is already associated with an outflow perpendicular to the disk-like structure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bontemps et al. 1996</ref>). On the other hand, neither the Keplerian nor the infalling fit can be ruled out from the PV diagrams of C 17 O and H 13 CO + . A combination of both fits is more consistent with the data, where the large-scale structure is dominated by infalling motion and gas from inner regions follows a Keplerian profile (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harsono et al. 2014</ref>). The presence of low-velocity points that seem to follow a linear distribution is expected for a Keplerian disk with finite radius. In addition, the lack of infalling signatures towards the perpendicular direction at small scales, agrees with the existence of a circumbinary disk associated with Keplerian motion around a central mass of 2.2 ± 0.2 M . Assuming that the major axes of the deconvolved continuum size represents the circumbinary disk diameter, its value of 620 AU is three times larger than the typical size of circumstellar disks around Class I sources, which is about 200 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harsono et al. 2014</ref>). However, other detected circumbinary disks around Class I sources, such as IRS 43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brinch et al. 2016</ref>) and L1551 NE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Takakuwa et al. 2017)</ref>, show comparable sizes to that of Oph-IRS67 (diameters of ∼ 650 and ∼ 600 AU for IRS 43 and L1551 NE, respectively).</p><p>Given the low mass of the ambient core estimated from larger-scale SCUBA maps (0.08 M ; <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. 2008</ref>), the two protostars can only accrete a small amount of additional material from here on.

Therefore, the centrifugal barrier will be located in the discontinuous region between both molecular emission. In our case, a spatial difference is seen between C 17 O and c−C 3 H 2 , however there is no evidence of a discontinuous change in the motion of the gas. The infalling fit for c−C 3 H 2 is associated with a central mass that is not consistent with the value obtained from the Keplerian fit of C 17 O, thus a centrifugal barrier cannot explain the presence of the high-density region in Oph-IRS67. Option (ii) was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murillo et al. (2017)</ref> for the Class 0 source VLA 1623. They observed a correlation between c−C 3 H 2 and C 2 H in a region located ∼300 AU from the source, and interpret that this emission is arising from the outflow cavity, where material is being irradiated by the star.

This was observed in C 18 O emission and the velocity gradient was found between blue-and red-shifted emission from transverse directions with respect to the circumbinary disk. For IRS 67, the search for a velocity gradient will be incomplete without the red-shifted counterpart, however, this possibility cannot be ruled out. Finally, option (iv) was predicted by circumstellar disk formation simulations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harsono et al. 2015b</ref>): Shocks are generated when the infalling material from the ambient gas or envelope reaches the disk, and may induce the enhancement of some species, such as c−C 3 H 2 and C 2 H in the case of IRS 67. The presence of a red-shifted counterpart is expected for this scenario, however, the red-shifted emission may be obscured by the circumbinary disk material. Further modeling efforts and observations of multiple species would be required to clarify the nature of the high-density region. C 17 O and SO 2 show compact and high-velocity emission only around source B. This emission arises from a region with a diameter of ∼60 AU and could be related to a circumstellar disk or to accretion shocks. If circumstellar disks are present around the sources, they are unresolved in our data and observations with better resolution are necessary. Resolving possible circumstellar disks will be necessary to evaluate whether or not they are perpendicularly misaligned and to estimate individual masses.</p></div>

For a flat profile, a lower column density of material with high temperatures is expected. Since CH 3 OH desorbs from dust grains at a temperature of ∼100 K, less material at high temperatures would imply a lower column density for gas-phase CH 3 OH. Therefore, the flattened profile associated with the disk evolution would explain the low methanol column density seen toward circumstellar disks around Class I sources (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lindberg et al. 2014</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Disk mass and temperature structure</head><p>Independent from temperature, the CO abundance is found to be comparable with the canonical value of 2.7 × 10 −4 . This implies that freeze-out of C 17 O onto dust grains in the disk midplane or conversion of CO into other species (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderl et al. 2016</ref>) is not significant, assuming thin dust and C 17 O emission. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows that the continuum emission arises mainly from source B and presents a minor contribution from source A and the circumbinary disk. On the other hand, the gas emission from C 17 O <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2a)</ref> stands out toward source B and has an important contribution from the circumbinary disk, adding more surface area with significant contribution to the total gas mass. A similar case was seen for the proto-binary system IRS 43 <ref type="bibr">(Brinch &amp;</ref> Article number, page 13 of 19 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. IRS67 Jørgensen 2013), where HCO + shows strong lines and extended emission while the continuum is relatively weak and compact. They also studied the case of IRS 63 that shows a brighter continuum and weak HCO + emission, the opposite situation to IRS 43. The disk associated to IRS 63 is more massive than that of IRS 43 (0.053 vs. 0.0081 M ; <ref type="bibr">Jørgensen et al. 2009</ref>) and could explain the difference seen in HCO + . The more massive the disk, the stronger the shielding would be, and thus, the colder the midplane where molecules can effectively freeze-out. Oph-IRS67 and IRS 43 may present the same situation, where the disk mass is not enough to provide an efficient shielding and C 17 O (for the case of Oph-IRS67) is hardly affected by freeze-out. This means that most of the C 17 O is in the gas phase and a significant fraction of the disk has temperatures ≥ 30 K (temperature at which CO sublimates from dust grains). In addition to the radiation field of both sources, the presence of an envelope can be regarded as an extra heating source, where the envelope serves as a blanket and the circumbinary disk remains warm (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harsono et al. 2015a</ref>).</p><p>From C 17 O emission and lack of methanol emission, a range of temperatures between 30 and 100 K is suggested for the circumbinary disk gas content. This is a wide range, however other molecular transitions with sublimation temperatures between 30 and 100 K are needed in order to constrain the temperature profile. In particular, the detection of formaldehyde (H 2 CO) towards IRS 67 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lindberg et al. 2017</ref>) agrees with this range of temperatures, since H 2 CO can be formed in the gas-phase or via grain surface chemistry. In the gas phase, CO reacts with H 2 to form H 2 CO, and temperatures above 30 K are needed in order to prevent CO freeze-out, while a temperature of ∼50 K is required for H 2 CO to sublimate from the grain mantles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Summary</head><p>This work presents high-angular-resolution (0 . 4, ∼60 AU) ALMA observations of the proto-binary system Oph-IRS67AB and its associated circumbinary disk. The continuum emission is analysed, together with molecular species such as C 17 O, C 34 S, H 13 CO + , SO 2 , C 2 H, c−C 3 H 2 and CH 3 OH. The main results of this paper are provided below.</p><p>The flattened structure seen in the continuum proves the existence of a circumbinary disk around sources A and B, for which a diameter of ∼620 AU is estimated, assuming an inclination of ∼80 • . The kinematic analysis supports a scenario where a Keplerian profile is associated with the gas motion of the circumbinary disk around a 2.2 M central mass, however other velocity profiles cannot be ruled out from this analysis.</p><p>The contrast between sources A and B at different wavelengths is more likely to be a consequence of different temperatures between both sources or the position of the two sources within the circumbinary disk.</p><p>The high-density region shows strong emission from carbon chain molecules (C 2 H and c−C 3 H 2 ) and may be related to the inner envelope material (i.e. outflow cavity, spiral-arm structures or infalling material from the envelope to the circumbinary disk).</p><p>The SO 2 transition is optically thick (τ ≈ 2), shows compact emission, and is detected only around source B. The emission arises from a region of ∼60 AU in diameter, which is comparable with the beam size (∼45 AU × 60 AU). The width of the line (∼20 km s −1 ) may be related with the presence of an edge-on circumstellar disk or with accretion shocks. The absence of SO 2 emission towards source A is an intriguing fact and observations with better resolution are needed.</p><p>The lack of methanol emission suggests an upper limit between 10 −10 and 10 −9 for the abundance of CH 3 OH. This can be explained by the presence of the disk, where the bulk of the material is dominated by the flattened structure in the inner regions and less material is subjected to high temperatures (∼100 K), preventing CH 3 OH sublimation from dust grains.</p><p>For different temperatures, calculated CO abundances are comparable to the canonical value of 2.7 × 10 −4 , suggesting a non-effective shielding of the dust and, thus, no significant freeze-out of CO in the midplane. Considering that CO sublimates from dust grains at ∼30 K, and the lack of methanol detection, a temperature between 30 and 100 K characterises the bulk of the circumbinary disk.</p><p>The main conclusions of this work are the detection of the circumbinary disk and the clear difference seen by the chemistry between the high-density region and the circumbinary disk, where different physical processes are taking place in each of them. The high-angular-resolution observations make it possible to distinguish and differentiate the two regions. Future observation of other molecules and more transition from c−C 3 H 2 will provide more information about the high-density region, while higher-angular-resolution observations are needed in order to resolve the cimcumstellar disks around each source and explain the chemical differences seen between them. Finally, Oph-IRS67AB is an ideal candidate for proper motion studies and planet formation, not only around circumstellar disks, but also around circumbinary disks. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

shifted emission emerging from the North-East area. In addi-
tion, the high-density region only shows blue-shifted emission 
with no red-shifted counterpart, and its emission peaks around 
2 km s −1 . SO 2 emission shows a velocity gradient toward source 
B (PA ≈ 30 • ), misaligned with the gradient seen for the other 
detected lines (PA ≈ 54 • ). This orientation difference may reveal 
that a possible circumstellar disk around source B is misaligned 
with respect to the disk-like structure, if SO 2 is tracing circum-
stellar disk material, or SO 2 may be tracing accretion shocks and 
thus, related with infalling motion. 

3.2.2. Spectra 

Figure 4 shows the spectra of C 17 O, H 13 CO + , C 34 S, C 2 H and 
both c−C 3 H 2 transitions towards the positions of source B, 
source A, and the high density region. Each spectrum was ex-
tracted over 1 pixel, that is, 0 . 1 × 0 . 1. At the position of 
source B, C 17 O shows a central component with two clear peaks 
at higher velocities (between −8 and −4 km s −1 and +4 and 
+8 km s −1 ), H 13 CO + peaks near V LSR with a wing morphol-
ogy that extends over positive velocities, and both C 2 H doublets 
present two peaks, related with each hyperfine transition. C 34 S 
and both c−C 3 H 2 transitions are not detected towards source 
B. Source A is associated with narrower lines from C 17 O and 
H 13 CO + , showing only a central component, and a weaker con-
tribution from C 2 H. As for source B, C 34 S and c−C 3 H 2 are 
not detected towards source A. The high-density region presents 
weaker emission of C 17 O and H 13 CO + , where both lines peak at 
−1.7 km s −1 . The two C 2 H doublets show intense and broader 
lines, and both c−C 3 H 2 transitions are enhanced in this region. 
Observing the emission of C 17 O and H 13 CO + over both sources, 
the peak in the spectra associated with Oph-IRS67B appears 
slightly blue-shifted (Fig. 4a and d) with respect to V LSR , while 
Oph-IRS67A shows a red-shifted displacement (</table></figure>

the central mass associated with the infalling fit is 3.6 ± 0.3 M , 
which is not consistent with the central mass of 2.2 ± 0.2 M 
found from the Keplerian fit of C 17 O and H 13 CO + . This implies 
that the c−C 3 H 2 gas may not be following an infalling motion 
around the geometric centre and another velocity profile has to 
be considered for this molecular transition.
