				<p>Aims. We explore volcanic outgassing on purely rocky, stagnant-lid exoplanets of different interior structures, compositions and thermal states. We focus on planets in the mass range of 1-8 M C (Earth masses). We derive scaling laws to quantify first-and second-order influences of these parameters on volcanic outgassing after 4.5 Gyrs of evolution. Methods. Given commonly observed astrophysical data of super-Earths, we identify a range of possible interior structures and compositions by employing Bayesian inference modelling. The astrophysical data comprises mass, radius, and bulk compositional constraints, i.e. ratios of refractory element abundances are assumed to be similar to stellar ratios. The identified interiors are subsequently used as input for two-dimensional (2-D) convection models to study partial melting, depletion, and outgassing rates of CO2. Results. In total, we model depletion and outgassing for an extensive set of more than 2300 different super-Earth cases. We find that there is a mass range for which outgassing is most efficient (∼2-3 M C , depending on thermal state) and an upper mass where outgassing becomes very inefficient (∼5-7 M C , depending on thermal state). At small masses (below 2-3 M C) outgassing positively correlates with planet mass, since it is controlled by mantle volume. At higher masses (above 2-3 M C), outgassing decreases with planet mass, which is due to the increasing pressure gradient that limits melting to shallower depths. In summary, depletion and out-gassing are mainly influenced by planet mass and thermal state. Interior structure and composition only moderately affect outgassing. The majority of outgassing occurs before 4.5 Gyrs, especially for planets below 3 M C. Conclusions. We conclude that for stagnant-lid planets, (1) compositional and structural properties have secondary influence on outgassing compared to planet mass and thermal state, and (2) confirm that there is a mass range for which outgassing is most efficient and an upper mass limit, above which no significant outgassing can occur. Our predicted trend of CO2-atmospheric masses can be observationally tested for exoplanets. These findings and our provided scaling laws are an important step in order to provide interpretative means for upcoming missions such as JWST and E-ELT, that aim at characterizing exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Super-Earths are among the most abundant exoplanets and are characterized by small volatile fractions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dressing &amp; Charbonneau 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fulton et al. 2017</ref>). Super-Earths have planet masses and radii that exceed the diversity of the Solar System planets ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Our knowledge of the variability of their interiors is limited, because data (e.g., mass and radius) are few and do allow for very different interior structures and compositions. The only parts of exoplanets that can be directly probed are their atmospheres. So far, there are only few small-mass planets (GJ1214b, HD97658b, 55Cnc e, GJ1132b) for which constraints on their atmospheres are available. However, near future spectroscopic observations (e.g., E-ELT, JWST) will allow us to gain detailed insights into the atmospheric compositions for a number of super-Earths.</p><p>The anticipated diversity of atmospheres on super-Earth exoplanets is subject to planet formation and evolution processes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Leconte et al. 2015</ref>). Different processes can shape the thickness and chemical make-up of an atmosphere: gas accretion from the stellar nebular, atmospheric enrichment by the disruption of planetesimals, outgassing from an early magma ocean or longterm out-and in-gassing processes, and hydrodynamic escape. The understanding of these processes is crucial for the interpretation of atmospheric characteristics inferred from observations. Here, we focus on volcanic outgassing that can constantly release volatiles on geological timescales into the atmosphere that were once trapped in the mantle. Volcanic outgassing can be the origin of enriched atmospheres, that <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dorn &amp; Heng (2018)</ref> identified to be likely dominating those planets of small-masses and warm to hot equilibrium temperatures. The importance of volcanic outgassing on observed super-Earths is ongoing research. We anticipate that the diversity in planetary interiors and thermal states may significantly influence volcanic activity and consequently the thicknesses of outgassed atmospheres, which we will address in this study.</p><p>The diversity in interior structures and compositions for observed exoplanets is generally expected to be large. For rocky exoplanets, despite the given data of planetary masses and radii, there is significant ambiguity on possible core sizes and mantle compositions. This ambiguity can be significantly reduced by accounting for possible correlations between stellar and planetary compositions, specifically their relative abundances of rockforming elements (e.g., Fe, Si, Mg) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorn et al. 2015</ref>). The observed relative abundances on Fe/Si and Mg/Si of planet-hosting stars have limited variability <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2</ref>). Here, we assume that the variability of stellar abundance ratios (Fe/Si and Mg/Si) is reflected in the bulk composition of the majority of super-Earths. By using this assumption, we can calculate possible interior endmembers that account for the anticipated variability of superEarth structures and compositions. Furthermore, thermal states of super-Earths are expected to be highly variable, since ob- A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. main served planets have different ages. However, the thermal states of exoplanets are extremely difficult to constrain by observations. We thus use theoretical considerations to account for reasonable ranges of thermal parameters. On this basis, we investigate and compare how volcanic activity and outgassing is affected by the variability in structural, compositional, and thermal parameters.</p><p>Outgassing is dependent on the convection regime of a planet. It is a matter of debate, what the most likely convection regime is of super-Earths. Here, we focus on the stagnant-lid convection regime in order to fully investigate all relevant parameters, and also briefly discuss other regimes. Furthermore, we restrict the volcanic outgassing to pure CO 2 , since it is one of the major outgassed volatiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gaillard &amp; Scaillet 2014</ref>). We focus on the accumulated amount of outgassed CO 2 over the lifetime of 4.5 Gyr in order to compare with Solar System planets. In addition, we discuss the time dependence of outgassing for a range of planet masses and for ages up to 10 Gyrs (see Section 5).</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. We first provide an introduction on convection regimes and previous studies, we then describe our methodology and results based on the large number of planet simulations. We provide scaling laws for parameters of first and second order influence and end with discussion and conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Convection regimes</head><p>For a rocky planet there are commonly three possible convection regimes considered in geodynamics: mobile lid (potentially resembling plate tectonics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mallard et al. 2016)</ref>), stagnantlid (Solomatov 1995) and episodic regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stein et al. 2004</ref>). Yet, new convection regimes based on thermo-compositional convection are being reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Moore &amp; Webb 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gerya 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Sizova et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischer &amp; Gerya 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lourenço et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rozel et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The stagnant-lid case is characterized by a very rigid lithosphere, which naturally occurs when lithospheric deformation is incapable of triggering mechanisms for localizing shear and weakening the high viscosity lithosphere. In this case, the resistance of rocks to deform in the presence of stress, i.e. the viscosity, is high. If no other rheological mechanism is included, the lithosphere is so viscous that in cannot be recycled in the deep mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Solomatov 1995)</ref> and deformation only occurs in the sublithospheric mantle. In this case, outgassing is possible by eruption of melt. Mercury, Mars and the Earth's moon are examples of stagnant-lid regimes, for which their very intense craterisation gives evidence that the lithosphere has not been entrained in the deep mantle since billions of years.</p><p>The lithosphere of the Earth does extensively deform due to several complex mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kohlstedt et al. 1995)</ref>: brittle failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byerlee 1978</ref>), evolution of microstructures at plate boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burov 2007)</ref>, rock hydration-weakening and associated phase transitions ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mackwell et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schwartz et al. 2001</ref>), magmatism (Marsh 2010), etc. Due to a combination of all these processes, deformations of the lithosphere can result in a mobile-lid regime (i.e., plate tectonics) in which the lithosphere is constantly recycled in the mantle. This allows greenhouse gases (e.g., CO 2 , H 2 O) to cycle between mantle and atmosphere reservoirs by volcanism and subduction of carbonate sediments which result from weathering and erosion of surface rocks.</p><p>If mantle driving forces do not exceed lithospheric yield strength, the lithosphere slowly thickens and stresses grow until lithosphere deformation suddenly occurs through a catastrophic event during which the entire lithosphere sinks in the mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fowler 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Reese et al. 1998</ref>) and outgassing is efficient ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gillmann &amp; Tackley 2014)</ref>. In this so-called episodic regime, lithospheric growth and catastrophic resurfacing events happen episodically <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stein et al. 2004</ref>). Venus might experience similar dynamics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Strom et al. 1994</ref>).</p><p>Likelihood of convection regimes Determining the likelihood of convection regimes for super-Earths is still a very challenging problem in geodynamics. Many interdependent physical parameters are suspected to have a major effect on the dynamics of the lithosphere, which controls the global behaviour of planetary mantles. The strikingly different regime behaviours between Earth and Venus indicates that other parameters besides planet mass and size are determining factors. The difference in solar incident fluxes is often used to explain their respective convection regimes, however, potential key parameters include rock hydration, thermal state, viscosity, melt fraction, compositional heterogeneities and grain size distributions. Heavy numerical implementations and computational resources are required to test these parameters in order to obtain robust scaling laws for the likelihood of different convection regimes.</p><p>After the discovery of the first exoplanets, different studies estimate the likelihood of plate tectonics with increasing planet mass and conclude increasing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Valencia et al. 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Papuc &amp; Davies 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Valencia &amp; O'Connell 2009)</ref> and decreasing trends ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kite et al. 2009a</ref>). Furthermore, effects of rock hydration (Korenaga 2010) and thermal states (internal heating versus basal heating and initial temperatures) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Van Heck &amp; Tackley 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Noack &amp; Breuer 2014)</ref>, as well as complex rheologies and the pressuredependence of many physical quantities ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tackley et al. 2013</ref>) can have first-order influences. Overall, the likelihood of different convection regimes for super-Earths is ongoing research. Here, we focus on the stagnant-lid regime only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Previous studies</head><p>In the following, we highlight few principle studies that investigated outgassing on stagnant-lid planets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kite et al. (2009a)</ref> predict that stagnant-lid exoplanets have high melting rates even for massive super-Earth planets, but they did not consider that melt may be denser than surrounding solid mantle material at specific depths, leading to gravitationally stable melt, thus hindering surface volcanism and outgassing. Also, they considered a purely temperature-dependent viscosity, which is expected to overestimate the mantle convective velocities, and therefore leads to increased melting rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Vilella &amp; Kaminski (2017)</ref> derived improved scaling laws for planets for variable convection strength and predict the thermal evolution and melt occurrence on Earth-like exoplanets. They propose that the occurrence of melting decreases with age and planetary radius. Large planets would only show melting early on in their evolution. This study also does consider gravitationally stable melt.  investigated the outgassing efficiency for planets of variable core sizes and fixed Earth-like composition and size. Outgassing is strongly reduced for large core radius fractions (&gt;0.7 R C ) due to the larger pressure gradient in the lithosphere. However, how likely such large core radius fractions are among super-Earths requires further research. While varying Earth-like planets to masses of up to 10 M C assuming magnesium-silicate mantles and different core-mass fractions, Article number, page 2 of 20 Dorn et al.: Outgassing on stagnant-lid exoplanets <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Calculation of interior end-members</head><p>The first part of this study concerns the calculation of interiors that cover the anticipated variability of super-Earths. We calculate those interiors given commonly observed ranges of astrophysical data and theoretical prior considerations. The astrophysical data include planetary mass and radius, stellar bulk abundances, and associated uncertainties (listed below). Chosen data uncertainties compare to high data quality. For a specific super-Earth case, we use the probabilistic method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorn et al. (2015)</ref> to calculate the possible range of interiors. From this range, we identify those interiors of minimum and maximum core size that fit data within 1-σ uncertainty. These represent the extracted end-members, which are input to the convection model. The extracted models provide profiles for temperature, density, thermal expansion coefficient, thermal heat capacity, thermal conductivity, gravity, and pressure. We provide more details on data and interior model in the following and refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorn et al. (2015)</ref> for more details on the probabilistic method.</p><p>Article number, page 3 of 20 A&amp;A proofs: manuscript no. main Data The considered astrophysical data comprise the following, which are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and 2:</p><p>• planetary mass M p <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref>, uncertainty is fixed to 10 %),</p><p>• planetary radius R p <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref>, uncertainty is fixed to 5 %),</p><p>• bulk abundance Fe/Si bulk (Fe/Si bulk = {0.5, 1., 1.5} × Fe/Si Sun , see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, uncertainty is fixed to 20 %), • bulk abundance Mg/Si bulk (Mg/Si bulk = {0.5, 1., 1.5} × Mg/Si Sun , see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, uncertainty is fixed to 20 %), • surface temperature is set to 280 K for all cases.</p><p>Masses and radii are chosen such that they follow the massradius relationship of Earth-like interiors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Valencia et al. 2007b</ref>). </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M p /M C R p /R C 1.</formula><p>1. 1.5</p><p>1.1 2.</p><p>1.2 2.5</p><p>1.28 3.</p><p>1.33 4.</p><p>1.44 5.5</p><p>1.52 6.6</p><p>1.6 7.7</p><p>1.69 8.8</p><p>1.74</p><p>Interior model Our planet interior model consists of a layered sphere with an iron core surrounded by a silicate mantle. We allow for variable mantle composition and thicknesses of core and mantle. For the mantle composition, we use the FMS model chemical system that comprises the oxides FeO-MgOSiO 2 . Thus the interior parameters comprise:</p><p>• core size r core ,</p><p>• size of core and mantle r core+mantle ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">• Fe/Si mantle , • Mg/Si mantle .</formula><p>The prior distributions for the model parameters are stated in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> and are similar to those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dorn et al. (2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dorn et al. ( , 2017</ref>. We calculate the interiors using self-consistent thermodynamics for core and mantle. For the core we use the equation of state (EoS) fit of iron in the hcp (hexagonal close-packed) structure provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouchet et al. (2013)</ref> on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. For the silicate mantle, we compute equilibrium mineralogy and density as a function of pressure, temperature, and bulk composition by minimizing Gibbs free energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Connolly 2009)</ref>. We assume an adiabatic temperature profile for core and mantle.</p><p>The interior model is used to calculate interior end-members for super-Earths, that are subsequently used as input to the convection model in order to study melting and outgassing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Convection and melting model</head><p>The employed convection and melting model is described in detail by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. (2017)</ref>, but briefly outlined in the following.</p><p>We model convection in a compressible mantle in the 2-D spherical annulus geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hernlund &amp; Tackley 2008)</ref>. In order to describe compressible flow, we use the truncated anelastic liquid approximation (TALA). In this approximation, radial reference profiles are used together with calculated lateral variation fields for temperature, density, and pressure (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schubert 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">King et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. 2017</ref>). The reference profiles are those of temperature, density, gravity, and pressure, as well as material properties of thermal expansion coefficient, thermal heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. These profiles are provided by the extracted end-member interiors (see Section 2.1). Given the TALA formulation, the convection code solves the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">King et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>The convection behaviour of the mantle depends on the rheological properties of the generally polycrystalline rocks. Here, we use rheology laws that were developed specifically for Earth's mantle. For pressures in the upper mantle, we use the diffusion law for dry olivine from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Karato &amp; Wu (1993)</ref>,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">η(T, p) = 2.6 · 10 10 exp 3 · 10 5 + 6 · 10 3 p RT ,</formula><p>using the universal gas constant R; for pressures in the lower mantle, we use those of perovskite (pv) and post-perovskite (ppv) as derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tackley et al. (2013)</ref> ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">η(T, p) = 2.5 · 10 11 exp 3.7·10 5 +3.65·10 3 exp( −p 200 )p RT , for pv η(T, p) = 3.6 · 10 8 exp 7.8·10 5 +1.7·10 3 exp( −p 1100 )p RT</formula><p>, for ppv for pressure p given in GPa and temperature T in K. Thereby, we neglect compositional effects on rheology. However, we do investigate the role of the viscosity on our outgassing results by adding a viscosity prefactor ∆ η which is set to 10 in case 9 and 1 in all other cases. For the rheology laws given above, we obtain a reference viscosity of 1.6 · 10 20 , 3 · 10 23 and 1 · 10 34 Pa s for olivine, perovskite and post-perovskite, respectively, at a reference temperature of 1600 K and zero GPa.</p><p>Melting is tracked at every time step in our simulations. Where mantle temperature exceeds the solidus temperature, partial melting occurs. If the melt is gravitationally buoyant, we assume that melt should rise immediately to the surface and outgas. Instead of transporting the melt to the surface, we calculate the amount of CO 2 that should be outgassed. The residue is consequently depleted in volatiles. We use the same parametrization as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. (2017)</ref> for outgassing processes <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>, i.e., if melting occurs at pressures below the so-called density crossover pressure (P cross−over ), the melt with initially 1000 ppm of CO 2 rises to the surface and depletes by 10% in volatiles. Depending on mantle mixing and the occurrence of partial melting, this process can happen repeatedly, however, maximum mantle depletion d max is set to 30% (volumetric fraction). Mantle depletion is thus directly linked to the amount of outgassed volatiles.</p><p>To trace the volatile depletion in the mantle, we use a particlein-cell approach.</p><p>The amount of outgassing can be affected by mantle composition, because melting temperatures depend on rock composition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kiefer et al. 2015</ref>). Based on the laboratory studies summarised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kiefer et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hirschmann (2000)</ref>, we derive an iron-dependent melting law for low pressures. This is an addition to the usual solidus temperatures. For pressures above 12 GPa, the iron influence on the melting temperature is assumed to be pressure-independent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆ T s,F e = (102 + 64.1p − 3.62p 2 ) · (0.1 − X F e ) , if p ≤12 ∆ T s,F e = 360 · (0.1 − X F e )</formula><p>, else.</p><p>The iron content X F e is given in mass fraction and the pressure p in GPa. The melting temperature for iron contents between 0 and 0.4 is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. For some test cases (10 and 11), we account for hydrated rock and use a wet solidus formulation taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Katz et al. (2003)</ref> by assuming an initial amount of 500 wt-ppm water in all mantle rocks.

This trend dominates outgassing at small masses (1-2 M C ). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref> (lower half of each subplot), we show viscosity fields for the reference case at four different masses. Phase transitions between perovskite (pv) and post-perovskite (ppv) in the mantle are visible where viscosity increases by ∼ 1-2 orders of magnitude. At large masses, mantle viscosities become relatively uniform which is due to a self-regulatory process ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Tackley et al. 2013</ref>). This process can be understood as follows. Viscosity increases with pressure which tends to decrease the convective vigor. However, this leads to a higher internal temperature of the mantle.

In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 5</ref>, we show planets of similar (solar-like) bulk composition, but with a different distribution of the bulk iron between core and mantle. The planets with large cores (right panels in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>) have little iron in the mantle, whereas small cores imply a higher iron mantle content. For the planets of 2 and 3 M C , the interiors with higher iron mantle content and small cores seem less depleted. In this case, the mantle density is higher and leads to a higher pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere which reduces the depth range of buoyant melt production.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> for a 2M C planet, we show the effect on depletion and viscosity due to the variation of bulk composition in terms of Fe/Si bulk and Mg/Si bulk . Generally, the planets of high Mg/Si bulk and low Fe/Si bulk tend to be more depleted. Also, for a given bulk composition, the influence of the core size can result in larger or smaller mantle depletion. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8c</ref> (Fe/Si bulk = 1.5 Fe/Si sun and Mg/Si bulk = 0.5 Mg/Si sun ), a larger core results in higher depletion (similar to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>), whereas for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  8a</ref> (Fe/Si bulk = 0.5 Fe/Si sun and Mg/Si bulk = 0.5 Mg/Si sun ), we see the opposite. In this case, the reduced mantle depletion can be explained by reduced melting due to an increase in melting temperature with less iron content.</p><p>The dependence of depletion and outgassing on core size and mantle composition is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref> for the reference case. For low-mass planets (&lt; 2M C ), we see that increasing core size and decreasing mantle iron content leads to a decreased amount of outgassing. The amount of outgassed volatiles is limited by the absolute mantle volume, i.e., there is less outgassing for large cores. Mantle depletion in these cases is very efficient and weakly dependent on core size and mantle composition. Furthermore, influences of core size and mantle composition seem to become insignificant in the case of low radiogenic heating (case 3 in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) (not shown).</p><p>For large-mass planets (&gt; 2M C ), we see the opposite, in that larger core sizes and lower mantle iron contents result in higher amount of outgassing and higher mantle depletion. In these cases, the melting region is relatively shallow and mostly within the lithosphere. High mantle iron contents imply a higher mantle density, which reduces melting by increasing the pressure at the bottom of the lithosphere. Thus melting is reduced to a shallower region. Even though a higher iron content lowers the melting temperature which would imply enhanced depletion, the effect on mantle density is stronger.</p><p>We note that differences in mantle composition affect solidus temperatures as well as the reference profiles of temperature, density, gravity, and pressure, and also material properties of thermal expansion coefficient, thermal heat capacity, and thermal conductivity.

Reasonable ranges for P cross−over for anticipated variabilities of exoplanet mantle compositions are poorly understood.

A significant influence on p CO2 is only seen for the lower limit of P cross−over = 8 GPa. At intermediate planet masses (2-4 M C ), where outgassing is dominantly pressurelimited (see Section 3.1), the density-cross-over pressure can significantly alter the amount of outgassed CO 2 .

Our approximation of ∆R CO2 represents the thickness of the outgassed atmosphere, neglecting any primary or primordial atmosphere, chemical weathering, or atmospheric escape. We compare ∆R CO2 with independent atmospheric estimates for Venus and Mars and find good agreement <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">(Figure 17</ref>). Compared to our scaled estimates, the thicker atmosphere on Venus can be explained by catastrophic outgassing events, whereas the thinner atmosphere on Mars by atmospheric erosion. We note that for both Venus and Mars, regassing of CO 2 into the mantle is precluded, which is also due to the lack of liquid surface water and plate tectonics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Comparison between the time-dependent depletion</head><p>model and the scaling law for depletion for a fixed 4.5 Gyr evolution</p><p>Since the evolution of depletion relies on the numerical integration of partial differential equations, Equation 9 does not provide an explicit time-dependent prediction for depletion. Yet the necessity for most terms in Equation 9 can be better understood considering the driving processes in our time-dependent formulation.</p><p>The first term of equation 9 shows that depletion is strongly related to the relative volumes of CO 2 producing region and the overall mantle. In our time-dependent formulation, these relative volumes also play a central role. We observed that the time-dependence of the existence of this top region is necessary to reproduce the onset times of depletion (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  18</ref>). The existence of the top region strongly depends on both lithosphere thickness and internal temperature which are both strongly linked to the surface heat flux. The fact that the heat flux derived from boundary layer theory enables to reproduce the time-dependence of our simulations is remarkable and gives us confidence that boundary layer theory can be used in the investigation of exoplanet evolution. Yet, several terms of our scaling law for depletion (Equation 9) are very non-linear and cannot easily be derived from our time-dependent formulation which requires the use of convection simulations.</p><p>The second term of Equation 9 can also easily be understood using our time-dependent formulation. The occurence of melting and CO 2 degassing depends on whether or not the solidus temperature is reached. Equation 15 demonstrates the importance of the initial temperature to reach the solidus temperature T s .</p><p>The third term of Equation 9 shows that internal heating also governs the occurence of melting. Again this can easily be understood from Equations 15, 16 and 29.</p><p>The importance of the viscosity (fourth term in Equation 9) in mantle depletion arises from several processes in our timedependent formulation. The heat flux is related to the viscosity as demonstrated by boundary layer theory (Equations 17 and 24). The heat flux plays a central role in both temperature evolution (Equation 16) and lithosphere thickness (Equation 28). The negativity of the factor γ in Equation 9 shows that an increase in viscosity decreases the depletion. This shows the central role of existence of the CO 2 producing region as a large viscosity will result in a low heat flux and a large temperature. Melting is therefore more important (Equations 15, 16 and 29) but as the lithosphere is too thick there is no volcanism and outgassing of CO 2 .</p><p>The Mg/Si ratio does not enter our time-dependent formulation. We therefore cannot reproduce the 5th term in Equation 9. The impact of the Mg/Si ratio could probably be understood investigating its effects on the Rayleigh number through density variations.</p><p>The 6th and 7th term of our scaling law for depletion are very non-linear and can hardly be understood from our simple time-dependent formulation. These terms show that some combination of internal heating, iron content and core size have a second-order effect on depletion. The impact of iron content can be understood from our time-dependent formulation as the solidus temperature is strongly Fe-dependent as shown in section 2.2.</p><p>In conclusion, the time-dependence of CO 2 -outgassing in stagnant-lid planets can be understood using boundary layer theory for any planetary mass. One limitation of our model is that crust production is neglected which makes it impossible to observe the recycling of basaltic material in the mantle. This could easily be taken into account in a parameterized model by estimating the amount of basalt produced and comparing its volume to the volume of the lithosphere. If the volume of basalt exceeds the volume of the lithosphere, then the depletion of the mantle should be decreased as enriched material should be dripping back in the mantle from the base of the lithosphere. This would simply result in adding a source term in the depletion in the CO 2 producing region. However, this limitation has no impact on the Article number, page 16 of 20 Dorn et al.: Outgassing on stagnant-lid exoplanets large planets which anyway seem to never be able to produce basaltic material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>Interior dynamics and outgassing are linked to interior properties. The anticipated variability of super-Earth interior structures and compositions can be partly informed by commonly observed astrophysical data from exoplanets. These data include planetary mass and radius, and bulk abundances of rock-forming elements (i.e., Fe, Mg, Si). In addition, we expect a wide variability on key thermal parameters that are very difficult to constrain by observations. On this basis, we compiled a set of superEarths that incorporates the anticipated variability of structural, compositional, thermal parameters, and age of the majority of super-Earths. This set excludes super-Mercuries, that are distinct from super-Earths by larger core-mantle ratios. It is yet unclear how frequent super-Mercuries are. Thus, our study goes beyond a simple parameter study where only one parameter is altered at a time. Our test cases incorporate both knowledge and ignorance on rocky exoplanet interiors.</p><p>This study is a significant step towards interpreting astrophysical observations of exoplanet atmospheres by geophysical interior models. Any interpretation of astrophysical observations of super-Earths atmospheres must be done in light of relevant formation and evolution processes of atmospheres. Here, we have focused on long-term outgassing processes that shape the atmosphere of terrestrial-type stagnant-lid exoplanets but neglect other processes such as (1) the early outgassing from a magma ocean, or (2) atmospheric erosion due to stellar irradiation, (3) weathering, or (4) any primordial hydrogen atmosphere. Considering these complexities, our results represent first order estimates. We briefly discuss these aspects in the following.</p><p>Outgassing from magma oceans Early outgassing from a magma ocean (e.g., Elkins-Tanton 2008; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lebrun et al. 2013</ref>) can be in principle incorporated by choosing initial non-zero values of p CO2 . It is possible that such initial amounts of primary atmospheres exceed the variations due to the long-term volcanism by up to several 100 bars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lebrun et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Atmospheric escape Although atmospheric escape can efficiently erode hydrogen atmospheres, the erosion of CO 2 is much more inefficient, also because their high mean-molecular weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lopez 2016)</ref>. In addition, the Super-Earths of interest are temperate planets for which stellar irradiation is limited. If erosion of outgassed atmospheres is significant, than it is the early outgassed atmosphere from a magma ocean that is mainly effected, since the stellar high energy-irradiation is strongest during the early evolution of a star.</p><p>Weathering Outgassed CO 2 can also be removed from the atmosphere via carbonate weathering. However, weathering requires sufficient supply of fresh, weatherable rock, which is limited for stagnant-lid regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Foley &amp; Driscoll 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Fo- ley &amp; Smye (2018)</ref> argue that weathering can significantly limit atmospheric CO 2 accounting for supply-limited weathering. However, given the possible variability in Super-Earth's compositions, the variability in carbonation efficiency of different erupted rocks requires further understanding.</p><p>Other sinks of CO 2 are water oceans, however the carbon ocean reservoir is small compared to the mantle reservoir <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sleep &amp; Zahnle 2001)</ref>. The solubility of CO 2 in water is temperature dependent and increases with lower temperatures (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kitz- mann et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pierrehumbert 2010)</ref>. In principle, our predicted amounts of outgassed CO 2 can be used as input in climate models to investigate whether CO 2 would be present as gas in the atmosphere, as ice on the surface, or partially dissolved in a possible water ocean (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Menou 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abbot et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tosi et al. 2017</ref>). For Earth-sized stagnant-lid planets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Foley &amp; Smye (2018)</ref> suggest that CO 2 budgets low enough to prevent runaway greenhouse and high enough to prevent global glaciation range from 10 −2 − 1 times the Earth's budget.</p><p>Primordial hydrogen atmosphere Any primordial hydrogendominated atmospheres could in principle make the identification of outgassed atmospheres difficult. Fortunately, even if spectroscopic investigations of a Super-Earth's atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bourrier et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benneke et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Knutson et al. 2014)</ref> are not available, considerations of atmospheric escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dorn &amp; Heng 2018)</ref> can provide necessary constraints in addition to mass and radius to distinguish between hydrogen-dominated and enriched (e.g., outgassed) atmospheres. Thereby, the thickness or mass fraction of a gas envelope that is likely outgassed from the interior can be quantified <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dorn &amp; Heng 2018)</ref> and misinterpretations due to the presence of a hydrogen-dominated envelope can be reduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observational constraints on outgassed atmospheres</head><p>Characterizing interiors and atmospheres of exoplanets is a highly degenerate problem. However, it is possible to quantify probabilities of atmospheric properties (i.e., mass and radius fraction of an atmosphere and its enrichment in heavier molecules) as demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dorn &amp; Heng (2018)</ref>. They determine that enriched (and possibly outgassed) atmospheres preferably occur on planets of small masses and high equilibrium temperatures. Their use of a generalized Bayesian inference analysis allowed them also to quantify the atmosphere thicknesses for a set of about 20 exoplanets. Interpreting such a distribution of possibly outgassed atmospheres requires geophysical interior models. Our study provides a significant part of the necessary tools to perform an informed interpretation.</p><p>Improved estimates on the distributions of possibly outgassed atmospheres are expected to be possible by the data of upcoming missions (e.g., TESS, CHEOPS, JWST). These missions will not only significantly increase the number of exoplanet detections (e.g., TESS), but also provide better precision on the data that we use to characterize their interiors (e.g., CHEOPS) and make it possible to probe in details the atmospheres of some tens of Super-Earths (JWST).</p><p>If observations confirmed our predicted trend of CO 2 atmospheres with planet mass, this would suggest that the majority of Super-Earths are in a stagnant-lid regime. Deviating behaviours may be explained by dynamic regimes other than stagnant-lid, e.g., plate tectonics ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Valencia et al. 2007a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kite et al. 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Korenaga 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Van Heck &amp; Tackley 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">O'Neill &amp; Lenardic 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lenardic &amp; Crowley 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foley et al. 2012</ref>) or atmospheres being dominated by the early outgassing during the cooling of a magma ocean ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hamano et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>Commonly observed exoplanets orbit at close distances to their stars which involves much higher surface temperatures than our assumed 280 K fixed value.

Here, we focused on temperate exoplanets, for which upcoming missions (e.g., TESS, CHEOPS, JWST) will provide data for interior characterization, for example from planets around M-dwarf stars (e.g., Trappist-1 system).</p><p>Impact on Habitability The classical definition of the habitable zone assumes the availability of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kopparapu et al. 2014</ref>). The outer boundary of the habitable zone mostly depends on the amount of CO 2 , while the inner boundary of the habitable zone is characterized by both the amounts of CO 2 and H 2 O ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tosi et al. 2017</ref>). Since volcanism maintained over geological time-scales is possible for stagnant-lid planets, it is suggested that these planets can be habitable (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tosi et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Foley &amp; Smye 2018</ref>).</p><p>Our results show that volcanism is limited for stagnant-lid planets of masses larger than 5-7 M C or older than 5 Gyrs. This suggests that volcanic activity suitable for habitability is restricted to small planets (&lt;5-7 M C ) as well as planets younger than ∼ 5 Gyrs. This is in agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Noack et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Foley &amp; Smye 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Habitability depends also on the presence of other greenhouse gases that affect the surface temperature. Changes in surface temperatures feed back on the deformability of the lithosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bercovici &amp; Ricard 2014</ref>) and thus on outgassing. Possible greenhouse gases other than CO 2 that can drive this thermal feedback include for example H 2 O. The efficiency of these feedback mechanisms depend on atmospheric amounts of the gases and their recycling dynamics between mantle and atmosphere. Here, we focused on the outgassing of CO 2 only. However, the limitations in volcanic activity discussed in our study similarly affects the outgassing of gases other than CO 2 . For example, the solubility of H 2 O in melt is much higher than for CO 2 . Therefore, partial pressures of outgassed H 2 O can be one order of magnitude smaller compared to CO 2 , while evolution trends of outgassing are similar ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Tosi et al. 2017</ref>).</p><p>Scaling law We developed scaling laws to summarize the efficiency of mantle outgassing depending on several Super-Earth characteristics. The functional form of our derived scaling laws is based on physics and involves free fitting parameters. Our scaling law is able to describe the two trends of outgassing as a function of planet mass: at low mass, the outgassing increases with mass, whereas it decreases at higher masses. We showed that thermal, structural, and compositional parameters can alter the transition between these two trends. We expect that other parameters that we did not consider could similarly affect this transition, however, they would not influence the existence of both trends. For example, rheological variability due to different grain sizes, hydration, compositions, or melt fraction are neglected in the present study.</p><p>Thermal convection model As commonly done, the investigated stagnant-lid regime is based on pure thermal convection and excludes the dynamical effects of crust production that involves production and eruption of melt (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kite et al. 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Noack et al. 2012</ref>). Crust production is rarely modelled in global mantle convection simulations since it is computationally more expensive (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Xie &amp; Tackley 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Keller &amp; Tackley 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Nakagawa et al. 2010</ref>, for implementations), although <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Moore &amp; Webb (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lourenço et al. (2016)</ref> reported that melting and (basaltic) crust production can have a first order impact on the convection regime of Earth-like planets. For example, strong enough eruptive magmatism can turn stagnant-lid regime into an episodic regime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lourenço et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Yet, melting and crust production will not always affect the convection regime. Here, we showed that partial melting can hardly occur on very large exoplanets that are in a stagnantlid regime. Although magmatism might be important for Earthsized planets, it could be negligible for smaller mass (Marssized) or larger mass planets (super-Earths). Small planets cool much faster which makes melting only important in early stages as it has been shown in the case of Mars <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Taylor &amp; McLennan 2009)</ref>. For high planet masses there are two effects that lead to reduced depletion. The first effect is the decrease in density cross-over depth with mass (see details in Section 3.5). The second effect is the increase of melting temperature with pressure. Thus, for high mass planets, the melting temperature beneath the lithosphere is generally higher than the adiabatic temperature which prevents melting. In such cases, magmatism might be restricted to planets with very thin lithosphere thicknesses that can develop in regimes such as plate tectonics. In the future, further investigations are necessary to better understand the effect of different tectonic regimes on outgassing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The atmospheres of the terrestrial Solar System planets are shaped by volcanic outgassing that occur on geological timescales, which we also expect to be relevant for super-Earth atmospheres. Furthermore, the atmospheres are the only parts of exoplanets that can be directly probed and upcoming missions (e.g., JWST, E-ELT) will provide detailed insights on exoplanet atmospheres. The interpretation of super-Earth atmospheres crucially relies on our understanding of volcanic outgassing. Here, we have thoroughly studied the diversity of outgassing on stagnant-lid super-Earths given the anticipated diversity of their interiors. Thus, our study informs upcoming findings of observed super-Earth atmospheres.</p><p>Specifically, we investigated the amount of outgassed CO 2 given the anticipated diversity of super-Earths interiors. We built on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. (2017)</ref> and assumed a stagnant-lid convection regime. We accounted for a broad range of possible interiors of rocky exoplanets (1-8 M C ) that are in agreement with commonly observed astrophysical constraints of mass, radius, and stellar abundances. Stellar abundances of refractory elements are candidates for placing constraints on the relative abundance of rock-forming elements (i.e., Mg, Si , Fe) in the planet bulk. We also accounted for possible variations in interior parameters that are very difficult if not impossible to constrain from astrophysical data. These mostly include initial and thermal parameters, e.g., the amount of radiogenic heat sources, the initial mantle temperature, or additional heat flux from the core; other investigated parameters are composition-related effects such as viscosity, influence of water and density-cross over pressure. The surface temperatures were assumed to be Earthlike.</p><p>Our results are comparable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Noack et al. (2017)</ref>, where a simple silicate mantle and pure iron core composition was used, i.e., at high planetary masses outgassing ceases.</p><p>Based on our large number of 2340 super-Earth models, we conclude the following: the reference case), maximum mantle depletion is reached and outgassing positively correlates with planet mass, since it is controlled by the absolute mantle volume. At large masses (&gt; 2M C , for the reference case), depletion and thus outgassing decreases with planet mass, which is due to the increasing pressure gradient that leads to an increasing melting temperature beneath the lithosphere and limits melting to shallower depths. For stagnant-lid planets above ∼7 M C , the large pressure gradient and the high melting temperatures beneath the lithosphere generally prohibits partial melting at depth. Thus, for stagnant-lid planets, we expect that (1) there is a mass range of planets for which outgassing is most effective and (2) there is an upper mass limit above which outgassing rarely occurs. This predicted trend of CO 2 atmospheres with planet mass can be observationally tested for exoplanets. Deviating behaviours may be explained by dynamic regimes other than stagnant-lid, e.g., plate tectonics, or atmospheres being dominated by the early outgassing during the cooling of a magma ocean. The distribution of enriched atmospheres can be observationally tested with upcoming missions that aim at characterizing exoplanet atmospheres (e.g., JWST, E-ELT).</p><p>• Thermal parameters can significantly shift the mass range where maximum outgassing can occur and thus shift the transition between positive and negative correlation between M p and p CO2 . We find that by varying the initial mantle temperature from 1600 K to 2000 K, this shift is on the order of 1 M C , whereas the variation from 0.5 to 1.5 time the amounts of Earth-like radiogenic heat sources results in a shift on the order of 3 M C . The tested ranges of thermal parameters broadly covers the expected variability among stagnant-lid exoplanets.</p><p>• The anticipated range of exoplanet ages is wide and on the scale of Gyrs. Although, most of our results summarize the outgassing after 4.5 Gyrs of evolution, we discuss the evolution of volcanism up to 10 Gyrs (in Section 5). For ages below 4.5 Gyrs, planetary age can have first-order influence on depletion and the amount of outgassed CO 2 . However, outgassing beyond 4.5 Gyrs does only add small or negligible amounts of CO 2 to an atmosphere. Our investigation shows that planets of masses above 3 M C (reference case) do not have significant outgassing, even over an extended evolution of 10 Gyrs.</p><p>• Mantle composition seems to be of secondary influence for outgassing. Mantle composition influences melting temperature and mantle density. A more iron-rich mantle material has a lower melting temperature which increases melting and thus leads to higher outgassing (&lt; 2M C , for the reference case). At the same time, an iron-rich mantle composition implies high mantle densities which increases the pressure gradient in the lithosphere. Thus at large masses (&gt; 2M C , for the reference case) when melting is limited by the pressure gradient as discussed earlier, a more iron-rich mantle tends to outgas less. Composition also influences the viscosity of the mantle, the melting temperature and the density-cross over pressure. While all of these factors tend to influence the amount of outgassing in the intermediate mass range (2-4M C ), no significant change in outgassing is observed for low-mass planets, where depletion is efficient for all tested cases as well as for more massive planets, where little or no outgassing occurs.</p><p>• The effect of core size is of secondary influence for outgassing. At small masses, where outgassing is controlled by mantle volume, a smaller core size increases the amount of outgassing. At larger masses, we find the opposite trend. Due to the bulk abundance constraints, a smaller core implies an iron-rich and thus dense mantle material, which results in a higher pressure gradient in the lithosphere. Therefore, melting is limited to shallower regions and outgassing is reduced.</p><p>• We estimate the respective gas layer thicknesses of the calculated outgassed CO 2 and compare them with independent estimates of Venus and Mars and find good agreement.</p><p>Finally, we provide scaling laws that summarize the influence of first-and second-order interior parameters on mantle depletion and outgassing on stagnant-lid planets. Thereby, our study represents a significant step towards providing interpretative means for comparative studies of exoplanet atmospheres.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
