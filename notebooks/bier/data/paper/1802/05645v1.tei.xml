			<abstract>
				<p>Large-scale transit surveys such as NGTS, TESS and PLATO promise to deliver a wealth of potential targets for follow-up transmission spectroscopy study. This will usher in an era of comparative planetology that will be limited not by a paucity of targets but by the scarcity of follow-up assets on the ground and in space. It will become crucial to ensure that the selection of targets is matched carefully against the availability and capability of follow-up telescopes. We propose a metric-based target selection approach that relies only on primary transit observables. The metric can be easily deployed within a distributed heterogeneous network of telescopes equipped to undertake either broadband photometry or spectroscopy. We show how the metric can be used either to optimise the observing strategy for a given telescope (eg choice of filter) or to enable the selection of the best telescope to optimise the overall sample size. The metric can also provide the basis for a selection function to help evaluate the statistical completeness of follow-up transmission spectroscopy datasets. Finally, we validate our metric by comparing its ranked set of targets against planets which have had their atmospheres successfully probed. We also compare the target list selected by our metric against some existing prioritised exoplanet lists.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The techniques of transmission photometry and spectroscopy allow astronomers to probe the atmospheres of exoplanets. By studying the variation in depth of a planet's transit curve with wavelength, individual constituents such as H 2 O ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kreidberg et al. 2017</ref>), Na, K and TiO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sedaghati et al. 2017</ref>) can be identified, and the efficiency of heat redistribution from the planet's day-side to night-side can be probed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nikolov et al. 2017</ref>). Wider atmospheric processes such as Rayleigh scattering <ref type="bibr">(Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2008)</ref>, and the presence or absence of clouds and hazes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Palle et al. 2017</ref>) can also be identified. This information in turn allows us to probe planetary and system dynamics, from for-E-mail: jake.morgan@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk mation theories ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fortney et al. 2013</ref>) to possible migration and evolution pathways, as well as assessing the potential habitability of planets by searching for biosignatures.</p><p>In the near future, the number of targets that will be suitable for spectroscopic follow-up is expected to increase dramatically, with the advent of new ground and spacebased transit surveys that are designed to target nearby hosts. Such surveys include the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS - <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wheatley et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">, Wheatley et al. 2017</ref>), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS - <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ricker et al. 2015</ref>) and, in the next decade, the PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars mission ( <ref type="bibr">PLATO -Rauer et al. 2014</ref>). These surveys will provide many thousands of exoplanet candidates suitable for follow-up studies, which will subsequently be limited by availability of follow-up resources, rather than by a lack of of suitable candidates.</p><p>It is crucial, then, to effectively identify which transiting planets are viable for atmospheric study, either across several broad-band filters (for a photometric approach) or by taking a transmission spectrum across a broad wavelength range. At present, targets which are widely known to be good for spectroscopy are chosen based on their individual merit, with some of these efforts attempting to rank planets by expected signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), or some other desirable characteristic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al. 2017</ref>). However, in order to be able to objectively select targets from an ever-increasing population for study, a more comprehensive selection metric is needed, including factors such as transit-time integration and telescope capability.</p><p>A key application of such a metric will be to provide objective selection criteria for the statistical study of exoplanet atmospheres, as a means to prioritize targets and to decide on strategies to allocate limited telescope resources. Followup programmes that adhere to metric-based selection can deliver samples of planets directly amenable to statistical analysis, as their selection is based upon objective criteria. Efforts to undertake such comparative exoplanetology have already begun, with studies such as those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fu et al. (2017)</ref>, who collected Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) spectra for 34 observed planets to search for correlations between the presence of H 2 O spectral lines and planetary parameters. Looking ahead, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goyal et al. (2017)</ref> gathered together 117 planets identified as observationally significant for inclusion in their grid of forward atmospheric transmission spectra, generated by the ATMO modelling suite.</p><p>Our paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the derivation of our metric, and the various extensions that can be employed for specific scenarios. Section 3 explores the scaling of the metric upon various physical parameters, to assess the usable parameter range. Section 4 then demonstrates how the metric can be used to select telescope assets and optimize observation strategy. It also validates the metric against previously-studied samples. We summarise our work in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">THE DETECTABILITY METRIC</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Derivation</head><p>We base our detectability metric upon the contribution to the signal-to-noise ratio during transit of an exoplanet atmosphere of scale height h R p , which has some opacity at wavelength λ and surrounds a planet of radius R p . The signal corresponds to the excess number of host photons which are blocked by the atmosphere (in addition to those blocked by the body of the planet) during transit. In the ideal case, the noise is fundamentally limited by Poisson noise from the host. We stick to the "quiet star" approximation, in which the contribution to the overall noise from stellar activity is negligible. We also do not consider here other potential sources of noise such as host star activity, detector/read-out noise or atmospheric effects.</p><p>Let us consider a uniform time series of exposures collected during a transit. We define t exp to be the integration time of individual exposures, and t over to be the duration between the end of one exposure and start of the next (e.g. due to the detector read-out overhead). The summed photon count over all exposures obtained during transit scales as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N ph = 10 0.4(mzp−m * ) t 14 t exp t exp + t over ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where m * is the host apparent magnitude, m zp is the telescope zero-point magnitude and t 14 is the transit duration in seconds.</p><p>Considering Eq. (1), in the regime where the transit duration t 14 is much longer than the ingress time t 12 , the Poisson noise N from the host during transit, summed over all transit exposures, takes the following limiting form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N = 10 0.2(mzp−m * ) t 14 (1 − δ)t exp t exp + t over 1/2 (t 14 t 12 ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where δ is the transit depth, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δ = R 2 p R 2 *<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and R * is the radius of the host star. The remaining unblocked photons can then be considered to be the source of our noise. This should also include a correction for the presence of the atmosphere (which is responsible for some part of this blocking), but in the regime of R p h, this correction will likely be negligibly small. The strength of our transit signal will be not the number of photons received, as given in Eq. 1, but the number of photons blocked by the transiting planet/atmosphere. For a standard transit of a planet with no atmosphere, this fraction of photons blocked would simply be given by the transit depth, as given in Eq. (3). However, for transmission spectroscopy, we are specifically interested in the photons blocked by the planet atmosphere; it is this wavelengthdependent absorption that gives us insight into its composition. On discovery of a transit candidate, the key host and planet parameters, except for h, are typically measured or inferred. We can substitute h in the case of an atmosphere which can be approximated as an ideal gas, existing in an annulus of non-negligible area</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h = k B T p µg ∝ k B T eq µg ,<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">A ann ∝ 2π R p h,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where k B is the Boltzmann constant, T p is the temperature of the planetary atmosphere, µ is the atmospheric mean molecular weight and g is the planet surface gravity. Whilst T p may not be known, the inferred equilibrium temperature, T eq , provides a reasonable proxy. For the purposes of our comparison, we treat µ as fixed. The planet's surface gravity g ∝ M p R −2 p , with M p being the planet mass. This is not determinable without additional measurements such as radial velocity or timing variations; therefore the mass must be substituted through a massradius relation. The M p − R p relation is sometimes expressed as a simple power law, M p ∝ R n p . For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zeng et al. (2016)</ref> find that n 3.7 for rocky planets. However, generally the relation depends upon several factors including the planet composition, equation of state, age, tidal effects and host irradiation. Indicative values for larger planets based upon detections so far suggest n ∼ 2 for Earth-to Jupitermass planets and n ∼ 0 for more massive planets. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref> is a scatter plot using data from the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia database 1 exploring this relation.</p><p>Current data on large exoplanets show significant scatter, and therefore no clean trend between M p and R p . For the purposes of developing a useful metric, the best approach for massive planets is to treat M p and R p as independent (i.e. n = 0). For completeness, we shall include n within our metric but, since current studies are often confined to relatively large hot exoplanets, we shall adopt a default of n = 0 unless otherwise stated. Applying our scaling for surface gravity to Eq. (4) and dividing out constants, we recover a scaling for h of</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h ∝ ∼ T eq R 2−n p .<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Hence, our total atmospheric signal scales as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S = N ph A ann πR 2 * (7) ∝ 10 0.4(mzp−m * ) t 14 t exp t exp + t over 2πR p h πR 2 * .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Employing Eq. (3) in the form R −2 p δ = R −2 * , and our scaling from Eq. (6), we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">S ∝ 2 × 10 0.4(mzp−m * ) t 14 t exp t exp + t over T eq R 1−n p δ.<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The ratio of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(9)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S/N ∝ 2 × 10 0.2(mzp−m * ) t 14 (1 − δ) t exp t exp + t over 1/2 T eq R 1−n p δ.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>By re-casting Eq. (10), we define a detectability metric D ∝ S/N. We use this to define our metric score throughout</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">1 http://exoplanets.eu/.</formula><p>the remainder of the paper, unless specifically stated otherwise. It comprises a telescope-dependent component, and a term which depends on transit properties that are either directly measured or inferred</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D ∝ 2C T (λ)10 −0.2m * (λ) t 14 (1 − δ) 1/2 T eq R 1−n p δ ∝ ∼ 2C T (λ)10 −0.2m * (λ) t 1/2 14 T eq R 1−n p δ (R p R * ),<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where m * (λ) is the host apparent magnitude and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C T (λ) = N −1/2 λ 10 0.2mzp(λ) t exp t exp + t over 1/2<label>(12)</label></formula><p>contains all of the telescope-dependent factors, with m zp (λ) the telescope zero-point magnitude and N λ is the number of spectral channels available to an instrument in the chosen operating mode. For instruments using broad-band filters, this term will be unity. The inclusion of a channeldependency in this way allows the generalised use of spectrographs, as well as broadband photometric measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Metric Extensions: Habitability &amp; Long-Term Studies</head><p>The metric in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> is appropriate for observations carried out over a single transit. If instead one wishes to consider the co-added improvement in detectability for observations of a number of transits observed over a fixed time interval ∆t P, then a modified multi-transit version of D can be used</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">D multi = D ∆t P 1/2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where P is the planet orbital period. This extension causes the metric to favour shorter-period objects, which will be observable more often in a campaign of length ∆t. Another useful modification is to consider using the metric for habitability studies, i.e. targeting only planets where liquid water could exist on the planet surface. This is only possible for a comparatively narrow range of temperatures, and so the temperature-dependence is dropped, yielding</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">D habit ∝ 2C T (λ)10 −0.2m * (λ) t 1/2 14 R 1−n p δ.<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The two extensions in Eq. 13 and 14 can be combined to yield a metric useful for an extended campaign targeting habitable planets,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">D multi habit = D habit ∆t P 1/2 .<label>(15)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DEPENDENCE ON HOST AND PLANET PROPERTIES</head><p>If our metric is to prove useful for future statistical studies of exoplanetary atmospheres, it is important that it should not depend too sensitively on specific physical parameters of the host or planet, to the extent that it selects a very narrow subset of systems.</p><p>In the usual limit of R p R * , we see from Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> that</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">D ∝ ∼ (F * t 14 ) 1/2 T eq R 1−n p δ,<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where F * is the host flux. Reducing each term in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">in turn, we note that F * ∝ L * d −2</formula><p>, where L * is the host luminosity and d the distance of the host from the observer. This is only strictly true when considering the bolometric spectral energy distribution (SED), but is still useful for examining approximate dependencies. From Newton's laws of motion, the duration</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">t 14 ∝ M −1/2 * R * a 1/2</formula><p>, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. For the third and fourth terms in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_18">, we have T eq ∝ L 1/4 * a −1/2 and δ = (R p /R * ) 2 .</formula><p>Gathering all of these dependencies together gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">D ∝ ∼ L 3/4 * M −1/4 * R −3/2 * R (3−n) p a −1/4 d −1 .<label>(17)</label></formula><p>We can use simple power-law, mass-luminosity and mass-radius relationships for main-sequence stars (specifically <ref type="bibr">17)</ref>. For stars between 0.4 and 2 M , x 4 and y 0.8, whilst for more massive stars of up to 20 M , x 3.5 and y 0.6 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Eker et al. 2015</ref>). In either regime, we note that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L * ∝ M x * and R * ∝ M y * ), to contract Eq. (</formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">M −1/4 * R −3/2 * ∝ L −(1+6y)/4x * ∝ ∼ L −0.346 *</formula><p>. So for stars from 0.4 to around 20 M , Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref> reduces to</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">D ∝ ∼ L 0.404 * R (3−n) p a −1/4 d −1 (18) ∝ ∼ F 0.404 * R (3−n) p a −1/4 d −0.192 .<label>(19)</label></formula><p>An additional, temperature-dependent factor will be introduced into our selection metric, as it applies specifically to some wavelength of observation. The flux in this band will likely not trace the star's bolometric flux, particularly for bluer wavebands. For example, in R-band observations, objects with T 5000 K will be ranked lower by our metric than predicted from their bolometric flux, as the R-band traces the Wien tail of their spectral energy distribution.</p><p>Applying the same analysis for the multi-transit version of D defined by Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref>, and using Kepler's Third Law, we recover</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">D multi ∝ ∼ F 0.404 * R (3−n) p a −1 d −0.192 .<label>(20)</label></formula><p>The sensitivity of the metric to habitable zone planets can be gauged by considering Eq. (16) in the limit of constant T eq ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">D habit ∝ ∼ (F * t 14 ) 1/2 R 1−n p δ (21) ∝ ∼ F 0.154 * R (3−n) p a 1/4 d −0.692 .<label>(22)</label></formula><p>It is perhaps unsurprising that Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> show that D approximately scales with F 1/2 * , as the metric is based on signal-to-noise considerations. D is only weakly dependent on a, from the product of t 1/2 14 T eq . The dependence of D multi on a is stronger here, but still potentially allows the metric to favourably rank suitable exoplanets over a useful range of host separations. D habit also depends on a and d, though the additional dependencies in this form are not strong.</p><p>The scaling of Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> on R p clearly depends upon n. The most sensitive regime would be expected for Jupiter-sized planets, where we expect n 0. Though, even here, the dependence is R 3 p , with R 2 p of that stemming from the dependence of the transit method itself. For smaller planets, in the Earth-to Jupiter-size range, we might expect n 2, to yield D ∝ R p . This is a more modest dependence and indicates that, as transmission spectroscopy sensitivity increases, it should become possible to detect atmospheres over a wider range of planet sizes. Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(19)</ref> suggests that D has only a weak dependency on R p in the rocky planet regime where n 3.7 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zeng et al. 2016)</ref>. However, at very low planet masses we would expect the planet atmospheric density would become too low for detection, due to decreased surface gravity. Our metric assumes that the atmosphere is opaque at some wavelength and does not factor in the decrease in opacity that would be expected as surface gravity drops.</p></div>

The first configuration we have selected is the use of RISE 4 , a fast-readout wide-field camera intended for use in capturing transients, with a broad-band 720nm filter (described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>In the interests of including a medium-sized telescope with a spectrograph, the second configuration we have chosen here is the Spectrograph for the Rapid Acquisition of Transients (SPRAT) 5 , employing both red and blue arms in order to reasonably use the stated V-band zero-point magnitude of 16.5. With a read-out time of 10s, this allows C T to be kept high. In practice, the spectrograph can be either red or blue-optimised, depending on the nature of the target.</p><p>(iv) Very Large Telescope (VLT) -employing an 8m-class instrument for broad-band photometry is generally not useful, except for particularly faint hosts or small planets. Better precision can instead be achieved with a spectrograph, so the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) suite 6 is employed in our comparison here. After overcoming systematics associated with degraded prism coatings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boffin et al. 2016</ref>), it has successfully measured spectra for Jupiter-to-Saturn-mass exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nikolov et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, Sedaghati et al. 2017</ref>) with qualities comparable to space-based observation.</p><p>In order to test the capabilities of our five instruments against each other, the metric was run using Eq. 11 for a test planet. The chosen target was the bloated super-Neptune WASP-127b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lam et al. 2016</ref>), a low-density world in orbit around a moderately bright G5 star (V ≈ 10.15), which is now thought to have a cloudless atmosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Palle et al. 2017</ref>). In these respects, it is an ideal target for transmission spectroscopy. In using Eq. 11 for each telescope, filters covering the red end of the visible spectrum were employed, as these are able to access spectral features associated with Na and TiO/VO. The exposure time for each instrument was chosen such that an individual CCD well would be 50% filled, thus ensuring linear CCD behaviour and facilitating direct comparison between the different telescopes. These times are collected together in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1, while Table 2</ref> has the results of the test case.</p><p>As we might naively expect, the instrument with the lowest spectral resolution (TNT/ULTRASPEC) returns the highest D score, while the VLT/FORS2 and SPRAT, with higher resolution, return the lowest. The TNT set-up's zeropoint of 25.25 in r and the negligible read-out time of UL-TRASPEC allows it to image the target extremely quickly, meaning C T 1, which helps to produce very high D values. The LT with SPRAT is of comparable aperture but is using a spectrograph, with a zero-point nine magnitudes lower. Its D scores suffer as a result, but in practical terms, the ability to take longer exposures with far greater spectral resolution compensate for this.</p><p>It is also notable that the VLT/FORS2, despite having the largest aperture of our set-ups, places WASP-127b further down the table (position 57 of 1461) than any of the other instruments. The relative brightness of its parent star means that only a short exposure time is needed, meaning we enter the regime where t exp &lt; t over , as discussed in Section 2.2. This demonstrates that raw atmospheric S/N is not enough in itself to make a target viable, and that a fuller treatment of the population via a selection metric is needed to find the very best targets. Despite this, WASP-127b remains in the top 5% of targets for all five of the telescopes tested here, meaning its selection is validated.</p><p>We can repeat this exercise for two well-studied planets, the hot Jupiters WASP-33 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cameron et al. 2010</ref>) and HD 189733b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouchy et al. 2005</ref>), in orbit around an A5 and K-type star respectively. These two planets rank among the best targets to study, as we expect, with one notable exception; the VLT/FORS2 places HD 189733b 30 places further down the list compared to the other four instruments. This is due to the brightness of the host star (V = 7.7, listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bouchy et al. 2005</ref>), which means that we enter the regime of t exp t over , strongly suppressing the returned D. WASP-33 is also in orbit around a bright host (V = 8.3, listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cameron et al. 2010</ref>), but its far higher equilibrium temperature, longer transit duration and larger radius (in comparison with HD 189733) means it still places at the top of the table. For these brighter targets, the smaller-aperture LT/SPRAT outperforms the VLT/FORS2, due to its higher observing efficiency. This illustrates our metric's utility in identifying the most appropriate telescope assets to employ for a given target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Accessible Populations of Transiting Planets</head><p>While our detectability metric works for single targets, it is far more useful to extend its application to the entire population of transiting planets, and produce a ranked table which can be used to evaluate some sensitivity cut-off for a particular instrument. This can define the population that can be   reasonably targeted by a given telescope, allowing observers to assess the relative potential of different telescope assets for transmission spectroscopy studies. Unfortunately, an absolute figure of merit cannot be recovered, due to the fact that our metric does not have an absolute sensitivity limit for atmospheric detections, stemming from the approximate proportionality in the h-scaling in Eq. 6. Hence, when comparing set-ups, the best we can do is to select one set-up as a reference, and then compare others to it for some subjective cut-off, referred to as D cut . In this way, it can be used to gauge which regions of parameter space are accessible to a particular instrument,as well as comparing the relative performance of different set-ups.</p><p>Using the five set-ups described in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, the metric score D is calculated for all transiting planets. The initial intake of planets is provided by TEPCat 7 , described in Southworth (2011). This catalogue contains an extensive set of physical and observational properties for all confirmed exoplanets and brown dwarfs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows these scores plotted for each of our five set-ups, and how the number of planets selected will vary with the subjective cut-off D cut . All of our instruments obey 7 http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/tepcat.html the same general distribution, but those using photometry (PROMPT-8, LT/RISE, TNT/ULTRASPEC) have maximum scores three orders of magnitude greater than those using spectrographs (LT/SPRAT, VLT/FORS2). Hence, two calibration instruments are used; TNT/ULTRASPEC for photometry (green points) and VLT/FORS2 for spectrographic set-ups (red points).</p><p>In order to make a "viability cut", the sample of planets is first sorted by their D score, highest to lowest. Working down the sorted list, the D scores are summed until a chosen fraction of the total cumulative score is reached. This fraction is referred to as f (D &gt; D cut ). All planets that comprise this chosen fraction of the total cumulative score form the "viable sample" for the calibration instrument. The lowest absolute D that makes the cut for the calibration instrument is also recovered. Applying this to other instruments in turn, all targets which score higher than the calibration instrument's lowest viable D score are selected to form their viable sample. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the results of this exploration. The yaxis of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the fraction of the total cumulative D score that is above our cut-off value. It is apparent that the cumulative distribution has a distinct "knee", beyond which is a long tail of planets with very low scores.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice of D cut must be validated through  observations. However, for the purpose of this study, D cut is chosen in order to allow us access to the relative performance of all five instruments for comparison. Although not a "natural" cut, it is a sensible cut for this purpose.</p><p>To this end, D cut is placed such that f (D &gt; D cut ) = 0.99, with the number of planets yielded for each set-up displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. These are the samples used in our subsequent analysis. Considering our spectrographic set-ups, the fact that the VLT and LT/SPRAT samples are not identical defines a sub-set of targets that the VLT can access, but that the LT/SPRAT may not be able to.</p><p>With this sensitivity cut made, it is now useful to explore the size of each sample and how the sample is distributed across parameter space, in order to check that the selection is truly representative. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows plots of planet radius against semi-major axis for our five recovered samples. The vast majority of planets are not accessible to any of our set-ups: this population largely consists of Kepler planets orbiting stars too faint for effective follow-up. The hot-Jupiter-type population of large planets in close-in orbits is accessible to all five of our instruments, demonstrating that even small telescopes can be effectively used to study such targets. All of our larger instruments can access Jupiter-sized bodies at larger separations, but propor- tionally, fewer longer-period objects are selected than shortperiod. The transit technique is inherently biased towards detecting large, close-in planets, so this can be reasonably expected. Our metric scales with a −1/4 , but this weak dependency is not enough by itself to produce this selection effect. Objects in close-in orbits also have high T eq values, which D scales linearly with; it is this stronger co-dependency that causes long-period objects to be disfavoured. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows the same samples for planet radius against transit depth. The clustering for all five samples is stronger here; no viable targets have a depth below 0.5 mmag (0.05%). This is perhaps not surprising, as deep transits are required to achieve sufficient S/N (Section 2.1). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates that a major population of transiting planets (detected by Kepler ) is too faint for effective follow-up, which highlights the need for shallow, wide-field surveys to find planets in orbit around bright stars. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows planet radius against recovered R-band magnitude. We see a stratified distribution here in apparent R-band magnitude; PROMPT-8 can access a small set of bright targets, the LT and TNT can take a much larger sample, while the VLT has the largest number of viable targets, spanning the distribution of parent star magnitudes. Additionally, for the very brightest targets, the performance of the VLT's spectrograph diminishes due to its lengthy overheads, as we saw in Section 4.1. The conclusion here is that, for an instrument of sufficiently large aperture, the metric can access targets over a wide range of magnitudes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> explores our samples with planet radius plotted against equilibrium temperature. We know from Section 3 that the metric has a linear dependency on T eq , but the VLT <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Planet radius against R-band magnitude, with symbols as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>(and to a lesser extent, the TNT and LT) are able to sample targets over a broad temperature range, with PROMPT-8's small sample being confined to hot targets of T eq ≥ 1100K. The lone planet at T eq ≈ 4100K is the "super-puff" KELT-09 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gaudi et al. 2017</ref>), a very hot Jupiter in a close-in orbit around an A-type star. If other similar planets are discovered, e.g. by TESS, then small telescopes should be able to access this new population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Comparison with Previous Target Selections</head><p>As stated in Section 1, selection of promising targets for atmospheric study has been predominantly done manually, often based on their being identified as good targets for atmospheric study by the discoverers. If these targets truly are viable, then the metric developed here should score them highly. Of particular interest are those targets identified for early observation by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST ); it is vital that such a facility is employed in the optimal manner. It is a useful exercise then to review which planets have been studied so far, or that have been selected for future study through transmission photometry or spectroscopy, to see if they score highly and are ranked as viable by our selection metric.</p><p>TEPCat does not hold any planet spectra, but the NASA Exoplanet Archive's Transmission Spectroscopy ta- ble 8 holds a volunteer-submitted list of planets studied with this technique, including the instruments used and the wavelengths observed. We can then easily perform a crossreference to see how these planets fare when put through our metric. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows a series of cross-references with known samples, which will be discussed in turn. The first of these shows our "viable sample" for the VLT from previous, with all planets present in the NASA Archive over-plotted in two subsets (orange triangles and cyan diamonds).</p><p>It is apparent that planets that have been studied previously from the ground (in some cases, in conjunction with 8 https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgibin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&amp;config=transitspec space-based observations, shown by cyan diamonds in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 8)</ref> are picked up by our selection metric (operating in single-pass mode, as in Eq. 11). This sample is shown as the blue bars in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref>. Our metric identifies all of the previously-observed targets as viable, with only three exceptions: the super-Earth 55 Cnc e, the Earth-sized GJ 1132b and the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Of these three, 55 Cnc e and GJ 1214b have both had their atmospheres studied with the HST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tsiaras et al. 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">and Berta et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">, and Kreid- berg et al. 2014</ref> respectively), while GJ 1132b was successfully observed from the ground by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Southworth et al. (2017)</ref> in an extensive campaign, and has also been studied using the Spitzer Space Telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dittmann et al. 2016</ref>). Because of our metric's dependence on planet radius, targets such as <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Cross-reference plot of our metric cut with a selection of pre-existing catalogues. Green squares are the sample of 117 planets in the ATMO grid of forward models that have been identified as observationally significant.

Purple triangles are planets that have been identified as top-priority targets for the JWST, fromMollì ere et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(2016)</ref>   these will naturally not score as highly as hot-Jupiter targets, but remain valuable to study nonetheless. The crossreference confirms however, that these super-Earth targets cannot have their atmospheric spectra effectively captured in a single pass from the ground, necessitating either an extended campaign or space-based observations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows that our metric identifies the same subset of planets as targeted for follow-up observations by expert observers. Our metric has a high rate of sensitivity towards detecting good candidates (a high true positive rate). The specificity (false negative rate) cannot be adequately measured, as not all observable targets have been observed. Our metric does not take into account potential observability issues like nearby bright stars, nebulosity or stellar variability, but can produce an accurate, ranked list of planets from which problem objects can be manually removed.</p><p>Considering targets only observed from space with HST and/or Spitzer (marked with orange triangles in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>), many of these fall into the larger population of sub-Jupiterradius planets untouched by our metric selection. Many of these are Kepler planets in orbit around faint host stars, with nearly all of these coming from the study of <ref type="bibr">Désert et al. (2015)</ref>, which employed Spitzer to estimate false positive rates from the Kepler satellite and find possible blended stars in their data set, not to identify targets for atmospheric study. It should be little surprise, then, that our metric does not select these targets.</p><p>The red star markers in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> show the targets selected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fu et al. (2017)</ref>. All planets in their sample have been targeted by the HST, specifically with spectra in the region of 1.1-1.65 microns, where water absorption features may be seen. These planets were initially discovered however, by ground-based surveys (referring to <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fu et al. 2017</ref>), and as such nearly all of them are also picked up by our metric as being top targets. The only three which are not are GJ 1214b (which we have discussed previously), along with the super-Earth HD 96758b and the hot Neptune GJ 436b. The former is not present in the NASA Spectral Archive, but has been targeted by the Microvariability and Oscillation of STars (MOST ) mission and Spitzer for photometry, and had radial velocity follow-up using Keck/HIRES (Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Grootel et al. 2014</ref>). GJ 436b was targeted by both the HST and Spitzer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Knutson et al. 2011</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. As <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, but restricting the metric sample of VLT targets such that WASP-43b is the cut-off point. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Knutson et al. 2014</ref>), which found a featureless transmission spectrum, possibly indicating a high-level cloud deck.</p><p>The purple triangles in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> represent a sample of planets identified as priority targets for the upcoming JWST. These are drawn from planets identified byMollì ere et al. (2016) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morley et al. (2017)</ref>, with the latter looking at the potential of the JWST for studying Earth-like planets. In particular, the TRAPPIST-1 system of seven rocky planets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gillon et al. 2017</ref>) is identified as a high-priority target. Nearly all of the planets identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mollì ere et al. (2016)</ref>, with the exception of the super-Earths GJ 1132b and GJ 1214b, are also selected by our metric, and WASP-76b is flagged as an unstudied target <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(West et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>As we might expect, the VLT cannot effectively target any of the Earth-like planets identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morley et al. (2017)</ref> in a single pass, which is to be expected; the authors find that the JWST will need to capture multiple transits in order to reach 5σ-detection levels, but this is well within reach of an extended campaign.</p><p>The green squares in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> make up a larger theoretical sample; that chosen by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goyal et al. (2017)</ref> in the construction of their grid of forward spectral models, using the ATMO 1D-atmosphere model. Their selection is based on the expected signal of an atmosphere of one scale height, with the scaling</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">S/N ATMO ∝ 10 −0.2m * (V) R p h R 2 * ,<label>(23)</label></formula><p>compared to our overall metric scaling of</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">D ∝ 10 −0.2m * (λ) t 1/2 14 (1 − δ) −1/2 t exp t exp + t over R p h R 2 * (24)</formula><p>Using Eq. 23, the authors construct contours of S/N based around the planet WASP-12b, which tops their ranked list. For a cut-off, WASP-43b is used, as it falls on the contour of S/N ATMO =1 in the V-band (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goyal et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Inspecting <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>, we see strong overlap between our metric cut and the ATMO sample. Only four targets in the sample do not make the VLT cut: 55 Cnc e, GJ 1214b, HD 96758b and GJ 436b, as we have seen previously. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> extends this inspection, by taking the metric cut at WASP-43b (rank position 115, corresponding to a 57.95% cut in the total cumulative distribution) to better compare the two samples. It should be noted at this point that the fact that these two samples are of approximately equal size is coincidental, but useful for easily gauging the level of discordance between the two. In doing this, the divergence becomes more significant, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  11</ref> and in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for the top 15 targets identified by our metric. Only 68 planets are identified by both our metric and ATMO, meaning there are significant populations belonging to one set or the other.</p><p>Referring to TEPCat, we find that many of the planets flagged by our metric have had no previous study done on them; i.e. the only reference listed for them in TEPCat is that of their discovery paper. A significant fraction of these planets were only announced in 2017; their not being included in ATMO may be because they were simply unknown at the time. By contrast, in the subset of planets identified for ATMO but not our metric, only WASP-131b, -132b and -139b are recent discoveries, being announced together in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hellier et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>One factor in this observed divide is our metric's stronger dependence on planet radius, as we saw in Section 3. However, this alone cannot entirely explain the disparity between the planets identified by our metric and those for ATMO. Compared to the scaling employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Goyal et al. (2017)</ref>, given in Eq. 23, D in Eq. 24 has additional dependencies on transit duration, depth and the observational efficiency of the telescope being used. These correspond to the second, third and fourth terms of Eq. 24 respectively.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, but comparing the ATMO sample to the NASA spectral catalogue. The WASP-43b cut is marked with a dashed line.</p><p>In order to make the metric cut, a planet must perform well in all of these aspects, with its rank position being suppressed if it fares poorly in any one of them. Of the additional terms in Eq. 24, the transit depth term will be approximately unity, even for hot Jupiters producing the deepest transits. Therefore, it is the action of the transit duration and efficiency terms which drives the disparity between our metric selection and those planets identified for ATMO. Our metric will disfavour those planets with short transit durations, or planets for which t exp t over . This latter term will have no effect for fast-readout cameras, for which t over ≈ 0.</p><p>In this instance, our metric is also restricted to observing a single transit for each planet (Eq. 11); planets not identified by the metric (operating in single-pass mode) will therefore need extended campaigns to observe effectively. In the regime of limited follow-up resources (as is expected to be the case in the near future), these should be considered lower-priority targets, particularly in cases where archived spectra already exist. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> compares the ATMO set to existing data in the NASA Spectral archive. In the limit of the WASP-43  cut, there is generally good overlap between the two. However, four targets successfully observed from the ground are not identified for ATMO, but are for our metric. There are many targets identified for ATMO but not present in existing data. As we have seen previously, there are many possible reasons for this, such as host star activity, the presence of close companions or a simple lack of follow-up resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have set out the imminent need for a selection metric in order to choose samples of exoplanets for future observations and atmospheric study, in order to fully open up the fields of statistical exoplanet study and comparative exoplanetology. We have then presented the derivation of such a metric, as well as possible extensions to allow a user to apply it to extended observing campaigns, or to solely habitable planets. We find that both planet radius and transit depth, as well as equilibrium temperature, transit duration and host brightness are all important factors to consider in assigning a planet a metric score, which will also depend on the instrument being used. We then demonstrated a series of possible applications for our metric, including comparing expected instrument/filter performance for a single target, and exploring accessible populations of transiting planets for a given telescope/location as part of a wider software pipeline built on the TEPCat database. Hence, we are able to inspect which regions of parameter space can be studied by which instruments, allowing us to exclude targets that will be prohibitively expensive to study in terms of follow-up resources. In order to validate the metric, we compare the targets it identifies against several previous samples of planets, either already observed or identified as significant targets for the future. We find generally close agreement between these samples and our metric cut, although super-Earth size and below targets are excluded, as their atmospheric signals are too small to be effectively captured in a single transit, even for a large ground-based telescope.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

This also includes the recent result of Kreidberg et al. (2017). Red stars are planets which have been targeted by the HST, as selected by Fu et al. (2017) and also including the study of Kreidberg et al. (2017). Purple triangles are planets that have been identified as top-priority targets for the JWST, fromMollì ere et al. (2016) and Morley et al. (2017). All marker sizes are fixed, and do not scale with D score.</figDesc></figure>
