			<abstract>
				<p>In the third paper of this series we continue the exploitation of Kepler/K2 data in dense stellar fields using our PSF-based method. This work is focused on a ∼ 720-arcmin 2 region centred on the Solar-metallicity and Solar-age open cluster M 67. We extracted light curves for all detectable sources in the Kepler channels 13 and 14, adopting our technique based on the usage of a high-angular-resolution input catalogue and target-neighbour subtraction. We detrended light curves for systematic errors, and searched for variables and exoplanets using several tools. We found 451 variables, of which 299 are new detection. Three planetary candidates were detected by our pipeline in this field. Raw and detrended light curves, catalogues, and K2 stacked images used in this work will be released to the community.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The data collected during the reinvented Kepler/K2 mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Howell et al. 2014</ref>) allowed the community to search for new variable stars and exoplanets in many Galactic fields, containing various kinds of objects (single stars, open and globular clusters, extragalactic sources, etc.). Despite the lower quality of K2 data compared to Kepler main mission, many techniques for the extraction and the systematic correction of the light curves (LCs) have been developed in these last two years.</p><p>Libralato et al. (2016b, hereafter Paper I) developed a new tool to extract high photometric precision LCs from the K2 undersampled images of crowded environments, based on the usage of effective Point Spread Functions (ePSFs) and of a high-angularresolution input catalogue. However this approach is perfectly suitable for any stellar field. This PSF-based technique also allows us to extract LCs for sources in the faint magnitude regime (K P &gt; 15.5), increasing the number of analysable objects in a field.</p><p>In this work we take advantage of this method, focusing our attention on the moderate-crowded region containing the open cluster (OC) M 67 (NGC 2682). During the K2 Campaign 5 (K2/C5), ⋆ Based on observations with the Kepler telescope and with the Schmidt 67/92 cm Telescope at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Asiago, wich is part of the Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica.</p><p>† E-mail: domenico.nardiello@unipd.it two super-stamps (covering a region between two Kepler channels of module 6) centred on M 67 were achieved. We reconstructed all the images containing the super-stamps and applied our PSF-based approach to extract high-precision LCs.</p><p>The OC M 67 is one of the most studied and intriguing OCs in literature (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nardiello et al. 2016</ref> and references therein). This OC has an age and metallicity similar to that of the Sun (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bellini et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Heiter et al. 2014)</ref> and is located at a distance &lt; 1 kpc ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pandey et al. 2010</ref>). In a previous paper based on groundbased, Asiago Schmidt data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nardiello et al. 2016</ref>), we have already investigated this OC, detecting 43 new variables. In this work, we used the same input catalogue to extract LCs from the K2/C5 images, and search for new variable stars among M 67 members.</p><p>Together with M 44 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Quinn et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Malavolta et al. 2016</ref>) and the Hyades ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Quinn et al. 2014</ref>), M 67 is one of the few OCs that host stars with confirmed exoplanets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brucalassi et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brucalassi et al. ( , 2016</ref>, using radial velocity (RV) measurements, have detected four exoplanets orbiting M 67 members, three of which are main sequence (MS) stars. In this work we conducted a search for transiting planets on all M 67 member (and not) stars, in order to identify low-mass planets that could have been overlooked by RV searches. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION</head><p>The K2 observations were performed during C5. The data-set includes 3620 usable long-cadence observations, that spanned over 74.82 days (April 27th -July 10th, 2015). The bulk of M 67 falls in between the two KEPLERCAM channels 13 (Ch13) and 14 (Ch14) of module 6. In this work we focus exclusively on the point sources monitored by K2/C5 on these two channels.</p><p>In each channel a super-stamp was monitored. The one in Ch14 is 90×400 pixels 2 , while the one of Ch13 is larger, with 312×400 pixels 2 . Overall the two super-stamps would continuously cover a region of 402 × 400 pixels 2 (∼ 0.2 degree 2 ) centred on the M 67's centre (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) without considering the gap between the two channels. We have analysed as well the individual postage stamps present in both channels.</p><p>We downloaded the K2 Target Pixel Files (TPFs) containing the complete time series data from the "Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes" (MAST) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . We reconstructed the 3620 images (1132 × 1070 pixel 2 ) of the series for each channel, one for each cadence number of the TPFs. We assigned to each pixel the sum of the values of the columns FLUX and FLUX_BKG. To each image we assigned the average Kepler Barycentric Julian Day (KBJD) corresponding to the KBJD associated to the cadence number.</p><p>In the following we give a brief summary of the LC extraction, that was carefully described in Paper I. Our method for the LC extraction essentially relies on:</p><p>(i) time-perturbed effective PSFs (ePSFs), (ii) a high-angular-resolution stellar input catalogue, 1 https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php (iii) six-parameters, local linear transformations between singleimage catalogues and the input catalogue, (iv) neighbour subtraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Improved PSFs</head><p>In Paper I we have described how to model the undersampled PSF of Kepler using the recipe by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson &amp; King (2000)</ref>. In this work we used a slightly improved version of the ePSFs obtained with the method described in Paper I. The method will be explained in detail in a future paper of the series focus on M 4 ( <ref type="bibr">Libralato et al. in preparation)</ref>. It differs from that presented in Paper I only in the fact that neighbours are iteratively subtracted (using the current ePSF model and an input list) to the sample stars used to define the ePSF model and imposing the positions of the used stars from the input list before computing the new improved ePSF models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The Asiago Input Catalogue for M 67 (AIC-M67)</head><p>We used as input catalogue the Asiago Schmidt catalogue of M 67 released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nardiello et al. (2016)</ref>, hereafter AIC-M67 2 . This catalogue, obtained using Asiago Schmidt 67/92 cm data, gives positions, magnitudes in 8 filters, proper motions and membership probabilities for 6905 sources in a field of 58 × 38 arcmin 2 centred on M 67 cluster centre. The coverage of this input catalogue is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> (red rectangle). Many M 67 stars are located in postage stamps recorded by K2/C5 outside the AIC-M67 region in both channels (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), hence the need of extending the AIC-M67. For each channel we made a stacked image using all 3620 usable images, as described in Paper I. Then, we applied the same procedure adopted on single images to extract the catalogues from the stacked images, excluding all sources that fell inside the AIC-M67 region. For the Ch13 and Ch14, we created two additional input catalogues: the K2's Stacked-Image Ch13 (hereafter K2S-Ch13) containing 437 additional stars, and the K2S-Ch14 with 328 additional stars. For each channel, the final input list adopted was a merge between the AIC-M67 and K2S-Ch13 or K2S-Ch14 catalogue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A PSF-based approach to Kepler/K2 data -III</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">LIGHT CURVE EXTRACTION</head><p>For the extraction of the LCs, we used the software developed and described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nardiello et al. (2015)</ref> for the ground-based telescope Asiago Schmidt 67/92 cm and adapted in Paper I for K2 data. Given a target star in the input catalogue, the software locally transforms positions and magnitudes of all its input catalogue neighbours (inside a radius of 35 Kepler pixels, i.e., ∼ 2.3 arcmin) from the reference system of the input catalogue into that of the individual K2 image. Next, we subtracted these target neighbours from the considered image. We extracted the flux of the target source from the original and the neighbour-subtracted images, using three methods: (i) PSF-fitting, (ii) aperture, and (iii) optimalmask photometry. For aperture photometry we used four different apertures: 1-, 2.5-, 3.5-, and 4.5-pixel radii. For optimal-mask photometry, in analogy with <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</ref>, we used two different masks based on the ePSF model: for the first mask (mask-1), suitable for bright stars (K P &lt; 13), are considered only pixels for which the normalised ePSF value is 0.005%; the second mask (mask-2), suitable for fainter stars, is made by pixels for which the ePSF value is 0.1%.</p><p>We have already demonstrated in Paper I that the photometric precision is better for neighbour-subtracted photometries; for this reason, hereafter, we will only consider neighbour-subtracted LCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Light Curve detrending</head><p>The larger jitter of the spacecraft pointing during the K2-mission (if compared to that of the Kepler main mission) translates into a worse photometric precision. To correct the most of the systematic errors, that are related to the spacecraft drift, several methods appeared in the literature. In this work we used the same detrending algorithm presented in Paper I for the K2/C0 Ch81 data, slightly improved adding a new step, that proved to be effective in taking into account the specifics of each campaign.</p><p>Already in the original Kepler mission the LCs show some systematic effects not correlated with the positions and the magnitude of the stars on the detectors, but associated with spacecraft, detector and environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Christiansen et al. 2013</ref>). During a K2 campaign, all stars in the same channel show common systematic trends in their LCs. This particular behaviour allows to model these systematic trends as a linear combination of orthonormal functions, called cotrending basis vectors <ref type="bibr">(CBVs)</ref>. In an analogous way as the Kepler standard pipeline for the LC reduction, we used the publicly available 3 CBVs (released by the Kepler team) for modelling and correcting these systematic features.</p><p>Given a raw LC normalised to its median flux, as that shown in panel (a) of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> (star # 7187 in the input catalogue of Ch13, EPIC 211380061), and the CBV i , with i = 1, ..., 16, our routine finds the coefficients A i that minimise the expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F j raw − i A i · CBV j i (1)</formula><p>where F j raw is the raw flux at time j, j = 1, ..., N epochs , and N epochs is the number of points in the LC. For the minimisation, we used the Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Moré et al. 1980</ref>). In panel (b) of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> we show the cotrended LC. It is clear that most of the systematic effects are corrected.</p><p>After cotrending the LCs, we detrend them for residuals systematic errors using the same procedure as described in detail in Paper I. This method consists in a 2D self flat-fielding, similar to existing techniques developed by others, but that takes advantage of our high-precision positioning, a result of our careful ePSF modelling and of the local-transformations approach between the input list and the single-image catalogues.</p><p>For each target star, we modelled its median-normalised-flux LC in order to disentangle the true intrinsic stellar variability from the systematic errors above described. In order to obtain the model, we divided the LC in N − 1 segments (where N is the number of thruster firings during the entire campaign). Each segment contained the photometric points collected between two consecutive spacecraft thruster firings. We have identified the "break-points" between two segments thanks to the variations of the target positions (X, Y). In each segment we calculated the 3.5σ-clipped average of the photometric points, obtaining N knots. We obtained the final model of the intrinsic variability by a linear interpolation of the knots over the observing time (panel c of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>After correcting for the intrinsic variability, the modelsubtracted LC reflected the systematic effect originated by the motion of the star on the detector 4 (panel d of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). This is corrected according with Paper I recipes. Briefly, we divided the pixels "touched" by the target star into an array of 40 × 40 cells. We filled the grid by computing the 3.5σ-clipped median of the LC flux in each element of the grid (panel f of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). For each (x, y) position on the CCD, the correction is given by the bi-linear interpolation between the 4 closest grid points, as shown in panel (g) of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. After different tests, we found that for M 67 K2/C5 LCs the best detrending was achieved by splitting the time-series in two distinct segments (the boundary between the two LC segments is marked by a dashed grey lines in panels a-e of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, corresponding to ∼ 37.2 days after the beginning of the campaign). Our detrending is an iterative procedure, in such a way that both the model for the intrinsic variability and the spacecraft drift are improved at each step. The corrected LC is shown in panel (e) of <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. This correction is far from being perfect and it could be considered only preliminary. For example, the cotrend stage works well for a large sample of LCs, but there are variable stars for which the use of all the 16 CBVs is not the best solution. Indeed, the best solution is an ad-hoc combination of CBVs for each LC that both preserves the intrinsic stellar variability and gives the higher photometric precision. Since we checked that a large part of stellar LCs in our sample <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Overview of the procedure used for correcting the 3.5-pixel-aperture LC of star Ch13-#7187 (EPIC 211380061). Panels from (a) to (e) show the procedure for obtaining the systematic-corrected LC starting from the raw LC. Dashed grey line is the boundary line between the two segments in which the LC has been splitted during the detrending phase. In panel (f) we show cell and grid-point locations around the star Ch13-#7187 loci on the Ch13 over the entire K2/C5. The coloured cells (size 0.025 × 0.025-pixel 2 each) represent the correction applied to the flux at a given (x, y) position. The black-square region is zoomed in panel (g): for a (x, y) position at a given time (magenta asterisk), the correction is computed by using a bi-linear interpolation of the four surrounding grid points (see text for details). We excluded the points associated to thruster-jet from the LCs plotted in panels (a)-(e).</p><p>preserves their intrinsic signals, we postpone the development of new LC-correction techniques to future works. We release the raw LCs to the community to stimulate the development of independent detrending algorithms that could be tested in the meantime.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Photometric precision</head><p>As in Paper I, we extracted three different parameters to analyse the photometric precision:</p><p>(i) rms: we have defined this quantity as the 3.5σ-clipped 68.27th-percentile of the distribution around the median value of the points in the LC;</p><p>(ii) point-to-point (p2p) rms: for each LC, we have computed the quantity δF j = |F j − F j+1 |, with F j and F j+1 the flux values at times j and j + 1, with j = 1, ..., N epochs − 1. We have defined the p2p rms as the 3.5σ-clipped 68.27th-percentile of the distribution around the median value of δF.</p><p>(iii) 6.5-hour rms: we applied to each LC a 6.5h-running average filter. We divided the processed LC in bins containing 13 points. For each bin, we computed the 3.5σ-clipped rms and divided it by √ 12. We have defined the 6.5h rms as the median value of these rms measurements.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> we show a comparison between the 6.5h-rms of the different adopted photometric methods for bright (top panels) and faint (bottom panels) stars, and for stars in Ch13 (left panels) and Ch14 (right panels). On average, mask-1 gives the best LCs for saturated stars (K P 10.8), even if lower rms are associated to 4-pixel aperture photometry. Bright, unsaturated stars (10.8 K P 12.5) are well measured with the 4-pixel aperture photometry (lowest 6.5h-rms ∼ 13.5 ppm), while 2.5-and 3.5-pixel aperture photometric methods are the best solution for stars with 12.5 K P 16. In the faint regime of magnitude (K P 16) 1-pixel aperture, mask-2 and PSF-fitting photometric methods give the best photometric precision.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> we show the simple rms, the p2p rms, and the 6.5h-rms for 3.5-pixel aperture and PSF-fitting photometric methods, that are, on average, the best solution for bright and faint stars, respectively.</p></div>

Using all these tools it is possible to detect all kind of variable stars (sinusoidal, irregular, eclipsing binaries, etc.). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> summarises the procedure used to isolate candidate variable stars using the AoV method. The procedure is the same in the case of GLS and BLS. Briefly, from the histograms of the detected periods for all the LCs, we removed the spikes associated to spurious periods due to systematic effects. Left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref> shows the histogram before (black) and after (red) the spike suppression. Right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref> 6 http://www.astro.princeton.edu/∼jhartman/vartools.html shows the AoV Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the detected periods, in grey and in black before and after the spikes suppression, respectively. In this plot we selected by hand the stars having high SNR. These points refer to stars with high probability to be variable (azure points). We performed the same analysis for GLS and BLS method outputs. In the case of BLS periodograms we used as diagnostic the Signal-to-Pink noise. Finally, we visually inspected each of them in order to obtain the final catalogue. From this catalogue, we excluded all the obvious blends by comparing the shape and the period of each candidate-variable LC with that of its neighbours (within 20 K2 pixels).</p><p>Among a total of 4142 stars (Ch13 and Ch14) for which we have extracted a reliable LC, we have found 318 and 170 candidate variables for Ch13 and Ch14, respectively, for a total of 488 candidate variables. Among these candidates, we have flagged 11 stars as obvious blends and 26 stars as difficult to interprete. In the difficult-interpretation sample there are sources that could be real variable stars, blends or stars with residual systematic effects that mime a fake variability. Finally we have cross-matched our catalogue of candidate variable stars with the available catalogues in literature. We considered only the 451 surely not blended stars, and we find that 152 of them have already been catalogued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gilliland et al. (1991)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CANDIDATE EXOPLANET TRANSITS</head><p>To search for candidate-exoplanet transits, we used the procedure described in detail in Paper II. In the following we give a short description of our pipeline.</p><p>For each star, we flattened and cleaned its LC by modelling the stellar intrinsic variability with a k th -order spline with N break points, removing out the outliers as described in the previous section. To take into account different kind of variability, we performed the analysis using three different combinations of k and N: k = 3 and N = 75, k = 3 and N = 150, and k = 5 and N = 175.</p><p>For each flat/cleaned LC we extracted the BLS periodogram and we normalised it as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Vanderburg et al. (2016)</ref>, in order to minimise the long-period false detection. We selected the five most significant peaks in the normalised BLS periodogram, excluding the harmonics of each peak and the spurious signals related to the instrumentation.</p><p>For each of the five periods found, we used BLS again to refine the central time and the duration of the candidate transit. We phased the flat LC and checked if the transit flux drop was at least one σ below the out-of-transit level. Then, we verified whether there were or not other similar flux drops in the phased LC (e.g., due to an EB). Finally, we visually inspected the candidate transits that passed the previous checks to exclude false alarms. Excluding the obvious, already catalogued EBs and false alarms, we found 5 interesting objects: 2 are EBs in the M 67 field that, without a proper analysis, could be mistaken for transitingplanet host; the other 3 are candidate exoplanets.

The flattened-cleaned LC is shown in the middleleft panel, while in the middle-right panel the phased LC is plotted with the period (P∼2.66 d) found by our pipeline. A careful analysis of the phased LC reveals that, in addition to the minimum ∼ 0.013 mag deep, there is another minimum ∼ 0.002 mag deep. The identification of this star as an EB is reinforced by its location on the CMD of M 67: this star, member of M 67 (AIC-M67 membership probability of 99.13%), is on the sequence of binaries.
