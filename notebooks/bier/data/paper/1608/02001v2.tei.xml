			<abstract>
				<p>We report 13 high-precision light curves of eight transits of the exoplanet WASP-52 b, obtained by using four medium-class telescopes, through different filters, and adopting the defocussing technique. One transit was recorded simultaneously from two different observatories and another one from the same site but with two different instruments, including a multi-band camera. Anomalies were clearly detected in five light curves and modelled as star-spots occulted by the planet during the transit events. We fitted the clean light curves with the jktebop code, and those with the anomalies with the prism+gemc codes in order to simultaneously model the photometric parameters of the transits and the position, size and contrast of each star-spot. We used these new light curves and some from the literature to revise the physical properties of the WASP-52 system. Star-spots with similar characteristics were detected in four transits over a period of 43 d. In the hypothesis that we are dealing with the same star-spot, periodically occulted by the transiting planet, we estimated the projected orbital obliquity of WASP-52 b to be λ = 3 • .8 ± 8 • .4. We also determined the true orbital obliquity, ψ = 20 • ± 50 • , which is, although very uncertain, the first measurement of ψ purely from star-spot crossings. We finally assembled an optical transmission spectrum of the planet and searched for variations of its radius as a function of wavelength. Our analysis suggests a flat transmission spectrum within the experimental uncertainties.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Among all extrasolar planets, those that are transiting are recognised as the most interesting to study in detail. The fact that they periodically transit their parent stars makes it possible to measure their physical and orbital parameters with exquisite precision by means of standard astronomical techniques. These measurements can also include their spin-orbit alignment (i.e. the sky-projected angle between planetary orbital axis and stellar spin, λ), their thermal flux and reflected light, and the chemical composition of their atmosphere. These parameters are precious for theoretical astrophysicists seeking to understand the general mechanisms that rule planetary formation and evolution. We are contributing to this cause by carrying out a large programme using an array of medium-class telescopes to perform photometric follow-up of the transits of known exoplanets. The main aim of our programme is to collect high-quality transit light curves that we use to refine measurements of the physical parameters of the corresponding planetary systems in a homogeneous way <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mancini &amp; Southworth 2016)</ref>.</p><p>During a transit event, the planet acts as an opaque mask which 'scans' a stripe of the parent star's photosphere. In the case of hot Jupiters, which have a relatively large size, transiting main-sequence stars similar to the Sun, this scanning can reveal star-spots. These regions are recorded as small 'bumps' in the transit light curve and provide additional information about the stellar activity and planetary orbit. High-precision, low-scatter and unbinned light curves are needed to catch these bumps, whose amplitude is colour-dependent. Thanks to observations of planetary transits, star-spots have been now detected and characterised in many circumstances ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rabus et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Silva-Valio et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sing et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mohler-Fischer et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mancini et al. 2013c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huitson et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mancini et al. 2014b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mancini et al. , 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Béky et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>In this work, we study the transiting planetary system WASP-52 <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION</head><p>The planetary system WASP-52 is near the celestial equator so can be observed from both hemispheres. In 2013 and 2014 we monitored eight (seven complete and one partial) transits of WASP-52 b in several optical passbands (covering 400 − 1000 nm), using four different telescopes (Table 1) and obtaining a total of 13 light curves. Five of the transits show anomalies that are compatible with the presence of occulted star-spots on the photosphere of the parent star (see Figs 1 and 2). We can actually exclude that the anomalies on the light curves are caused by plages because plages do not resize in the photosphere, but in the chromosphere. Actually, using a telescope working in the optical, we can only see stellar light coming from the photosphere, except for a small amount of light in the H and K lines at 3933.7 and 3968.5 ˚ A, Hα at 6562.8 ˚ A, and a few other lines. That means that if WASP-52 b occulted a plage, we would have to observe anomalies only in the g ′ band, i.e. the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical and Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) bluest band (see Sect. 2.4), as in the case of HATS-2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mohler-Fischer et al. 2013</ref>). We can also exclude that the anomalies on the light curves are caused by bright spots (i.e. faculae) because of the transit depth: the data points that were not affected by star-spots are at the right transit depth; on the contrary, if we consider that the planet occulted hot spots, then the data points that were not affected by them are at the wrong transit depth. Moreover, faculae are mostly seen at the solar limb, not in the disc centre. So, also their effect to the transit light curves should be negligible, except maybe close to the limb, but this is not the case.</p><p>The transit on 2013/09/14 was simultaneously followed by two telescopes at different observing sites <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>, second panel). The complete transit was observed from Italy, and part was also observed from Spain on a cloudy night. Interestingly, the same anomalous feature is seen in both light curves, demonstrating the power of the two-site observational strategy in differentiating true astrophysical signal from systematic noise ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ciceri et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mancini et al. 2013a</ref>).</p><p>The transit on 2014/07/24 was also simultaneously observed using two telescopes, located on the same site in the Southern hemisphere <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2, first panel)</ref>. Also in this case, one telescope monitored the entire transit but the other telescope missed half of it, due to a failure of the telescope control system. Also in this case, an anomaly was recorded by both telescopes.</p><p>Observations were all performed by defocussing the telescopes, in order to increase the photometric precision ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Southworth et al. 2009</ref>), and using autoguiding. In all cases except the MPG 2.2 m telescope, the CCDs were windowed to decrease the readout time and therefore increase the cadence of the observations. The reduced data will be made available at the CDS 1 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Details of the transit observations presented in this work.

This telescope has a focal length of 9857.1 mm and is equipped with the DLR-MKIII camera, which has 4k × 4k pixels of size 15 µm. The plate scale is 0.32 arcsec pixel −1 and the field-of-view (FOV) is 21.5 arcmin × 21.5 arcmin. The first three transits were observed in 2013 through a Cousins-R filter, whereas the last one was observed in 2014 through a Cousins-I filter and clearly exhibits an anomaly caused by stellar activity. Three transits were completely observed, and one was partially observed due to unfavourable weather conditions. The resulting light curves are plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p></div>

This telescope has a focal length of 12 m, a focal ratio of f /8 and is equipped with the BFOSC (Bologna Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) imager, which has a back-illuminated CCD with 1300 × 1340 pixels and a pixel size of 20 µm. With the focal reducer the telescope is a f /5, so that the current plate scale is 0.58 arcsec pixel −1 and the FOV is 13 arcmin × 12.6 arcmin. A Gunn-r filter was used, and the light curve is plotted in the second panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. It shows an anomaly compatible with a star-spot complex occulted by the planet during the transit event. The shape of the second part of the light curve is very similar to that observed from Calar Alto.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Danish 1.54 m telescope</head><p>Four transits (three complete and one partial) of WASP-52 b were observed through a Bessel-R filter between 2014 July and September with the DFOSC (Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera) imager mounted on the Danish 1.54 m Telescope at ESO La Silla, Chile. Since 2012 DFOSC has been equipped with a new camera, an e2v CCD with 2048 × 4096 pixels and 32-bit encoding. The plate scale is 0.39 arcsec pixel −1 . In the current optical set-up, the incoming light illuminates only half of the CCD, so the FOV is 13.7 arcmin × 13.7 arcmin. Once again, the three complete light curves present anomalies compatible with parent star's starspot activity (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>). Unfortunately, the transit recorded on 2014/09/04 was not fully covered due to technical problems at the beginning of the observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">MPG 2.2 m telescope</head><p>The transit event recorded with the Danish 1.54 m telescope on 2014/07/24 was partially monitored with the MPG 2.2 m telescope, located at the same observatory. This telescope has a focal length of 17.6 m and mounts three different instruments. We used GROND, an imaging camera with the ability to observe in four optical (similar to Sloan g ′ , r ′ , i ′ , z ′ ) and three near-IR (NIR) bands (J, H, K) simultaneously. Since the photometric precision of the NIR arms is not as good as that of the optical ones ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Pierini et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mancini et al. 2013b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mancini et al. , 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nikolov et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al. 2014</ref>), we only considered the optical data. Incoming light is splitted by dichroics in the optical arms and channelled towards four back-illuminated 2048 × 2048 pixel E2V CCDs.</p><p>The pixel size of the CCDs is 13.5 µm, the plate scale is 0.158 arcsec pixel −1 , and the FOV is 5.4 arcmin × 5.4 arcmin. Due to a critical failure of the telescope control system, the observations were interrupted for ∼ 45 minutes, so the egress phases of the transit were not observed (see panel 1 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>). Incomplete light curves are more difficult to model, especially if they are affected by anomalies. Moreover, the amplitude of a star-spot anomaly is colour-dependent. Indeed, star-spots have a lower temperature with respect to the photosphere and, therefore, the flux ratio is expected to be lower in the blue than in red. This implies that moving from g ′ to z ′ stars-pots become brighter and star-spot features on transit light curves become less evident. In our case, the transit observed with GROND was interrupted during the star-spot anomaly and this makes the modelling quite difficult. We found that the GROND r ′ light curve is in a good agreement with that observed with the Danish telescope in Bessel R, but the same is not true for the other bands. In particular the g ′ band looks to be affected by a systematic or a brighter spot, while the i ′ and z ′ bands are quite flat during totality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Aperture photometry</head><p>All the data were reduced in a homogeneous way, using a revised version of the defot code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Southworth et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Southworth et al. , 2014</ref>). In brief, the scientific images were calibrated by means of master-bias and master-flat frames and then their two-dimensional offset with respect to a reference frame was calculated. We performed standard aperture photometry to extract the light curves of the transits. This was done by running the aper routine, after having placed the three apertures by hand on the target and on a set of good comparison stars. The sizes of the apertures were decided after several attempts, by selecting those having the lowest scatter when compared with a fitted model. The resulting light curves were normalised to zero magnitude by fitting a straight line to the out-of-transit data. As in our previous papers, we enlarged the uncertainties for each light curve, as they are generally underestimated in the aperture-photometry process. This enlargement of the error bars was performed by imposing a reduced χ 2 of χ 2 ν = 1 versus a fitted model 2 .

As in previous cases ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mancini et al. 2013c</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mancini et al. , 2014b</ref>, we utilised the prism 3 and gemc 4 codes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013</ref>, which allowed us to fit both the full transit event and the shorter star-spot-occultation event simultaneously.

We assumed a circular orbit <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>). Each of our transit light curves with anomalies was modelled considering a single star-spot complex.</p><p>We also analysed the best three light curves presented in the discovery paper (we excluded incomplete and low-quality light curves) and taken with the Euler 1.2 m and the FTS 2 m telescopes ( <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>), one light curve obtained with the Minerva 0.7 m telescope ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Swift et al. 2015</ref>), and six taken with the Baronnies 0.82 m telescope (available on the ETD 5 web archive). The last were grouped according to the filter used. Details are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The first Euler light curve presents a star-spot anomaly and we modelled it with prism+gemc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Orbital period determination</head><p>We refined the transit ephemeris of WASP-52 b thanks to the new photometric data. The transit times and their uncertainties were estimated using the codes mentioned above and placed on the BJD(TDB) time system. We only considered timings based on complete light curves and taken with professional telescopes. A series of very scattered points at the egress phase were excluded from the FTS 2.0 m light curve, but this did not compromise the precision of T0 achieved for this data set. The reference epoch was chosen as that corresponding to our best light curve, based on the rms scatter of the data (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The timings were fitted with a straight line to obtain: T0 = BJD(TDB) 56862.79776(16) + 1.74978119(52) E, where E represents the number of orbital cycles after the reference epoch, and the quantities in brackets are the uncertainties in the two final digits of the preceding number. All transit times and their residual versus the fitted ephemeris are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. The residuals are also plotted in the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>. The reduced χ 2 of the fit 7 is quite high, χ 2 ν = 8.98, suggesting that the linear ephemeris does not give a good match to the observations. The uncertainties given above have been inflated to account for this by multiplying them by χ 2 ν . We then added more timings to our sample, taken from the ETD archive. We selected light curves having a complete transit coverage and a Data Quality index ≤ 1. Adding these nine timings to the sample, we repeated the analysis, obtaining a worse χ 2 ν of 19.60. The new residuals are shown in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>. This suggests that the orbital period of WASP-52 b is not constant, and that transit timing variations (TTVs) occur due to the presence of additional bodies in the system. However, based on our extensive experience in such kind of analysis, an excess χ 2 ν is often caused by underestimation of the uncertainty of the measurements, which have been collected using multiple telescopes, instruments and time sources. The presence of star-spots can also cause an excess χ 2 ν ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barros et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Oshagh et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ioannidis et al. 2016</ref>). Actually, a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the timing residuals does not reveal a significant periodic variation. Moreover, the timing measurements are often separated by hundreds of days so are insensitive to many periodicities. The systematic observation of many subsequent transits, preferably performed with the same telescope, would be the only way to claim a TTV with a high level of confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">star-spot analysis</head><p>As described above, the anomalies in some of our light curves were modelled as star-spots using the prism+gemc codes   (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables 2 and 3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Star-spot temperature</head><p>Since star-spots have lower temperatures in comparison to stellar photosphere, we used the blackbody approximation and applied equation 1 of Silva (2003)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ρspot = exp (hν/KBT eff ) − 1 exp (hν/KBTspot) − 1<label>(1)</label></formula><p>to estimate the temperatures of the star-spots based on their contrast <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>, the frequency ν, and on the effective temperature of WASP-52 A, T eff = 5000 ± 100 K ( <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>). h is the Planck constant and KB is the Boltzmann constant. The temperatures are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> and agree well with each other. This can be also seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>, in which we compare the star-spot contrasts calculated by prism+gemc with those expected for a star-spot at 4650 K over a stellar photosphere of 5000 K, both modelled with ATLAS9 model atmospheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kurucz 1979</ref>). We then considered the three star-spots detected between 2014 July and August with the Danish telescope through the same filter (Bessel R), and estimated a weighted mean star-spot temperature, 4738 ± 85 K. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8</ref> compares this value with those measured for other main-sequence dwarf stars. This plot tells us that, in the case of dwarf stars, the temperature difference between the photosphere and star-spots does not seem to be correlated with spectral class. This is contrary to the trend in star-spot temperature contrasts with spectral type found by various authors, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berdyugina (2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Star-spot size and lifetime</head><p>Over a 43 d time interval, we have observed star-spot features in four transits of WASP-52 b, three with the Danish 1.54 m telescope and one with the CA 1.23 m telescope. We label these transits as t1, t2, t3, t4 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). The time intervals between t1 and t2, and t2 and t3, are 14 d, whereas that between t3 and t4 is 15 d. It is worth considering if these events are due to the same star-spot, or star-spot complex, being occulted during each transit. Indeed, due to differential rotation, a large star-spot, which covers a broad latitudinal range, could possibly break into smaller spots with shorter lifetimes. First, we note that the four star-spots are located at roughly the same co-latitude and have the same angular radius within the uncertainties <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3)</ref>. Considering t1, the angular size of the star-spot corresponds to a radius of 117 737 ± 27 978 km. Knowing the size, we can estimate the lifetime of the star-spot by applying the G-W empirical relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gnevyshev 1938;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Waldmeier 1955)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Amax = DGWT,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Amax is the maximum size of the star-spot in units of micro solar hemispheres (MSH) and T is the star-spot lifetime. The quantity DGW was estimated to be 10.89 ± 0.18 MSH d −1 for individual sunspots <ref type="bibr">(Petrovay &amp; van Driel-Gesztely 1997)</ref>. Using the G-W relationship, we estimated a lifetime of 11.7 months for the star-spot corresponding to t1. However, this relation was doubted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradshaw &amp; Hartigan (2014)</ref>, who argued that it returns star-spot lifetimes that are overestimated by at least two orders of magnitude, and suggested an alternative relation, based on turbulent magnetic diffusivity operating at the supergranule scale. This new relation lowers the lifetime of the star-spot in transit t1 to 70 d for a supergranule size of ∼ 70 000 km, which corresponds to 0.1 R ⊙ . Even this shorter lifetime means that the star-spot detected in t1 should have lasted sufficiently long to reappear in the three subsequent transit events that we recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Spin-orbit alignment</head><p>In general, the occultation of the same star-spot complex in two or more transit events is a clear indicator that there is a good alignment between the planet's orbital axis and its host star's spin. This allows the measurement of the skyprojected spin-orbit angle, λ, with higher precision than can normally be obtained from the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013</ref>). On the contrary, if we have observed two different star-spots, their latitude difference is  completely degenerate with λ. Discriminating the two cases is not trivial. Crucial parameters to take into account are the rotational period of the parent star, Prot, and the difference in position and time between the star-spots. If we monitor many transits of the same planet and have observed the same star-spot in two different transit events, then the distance D covered by the star-spot, with respect to a terrestrial observer, in the time between the two detections, is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Mancini et al. 2014b</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">D = (n × 2πR lat ) + d,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where n is the number of revolutions completed by the star, R lat is the scaled stellar radius for the latitude at which the star-spot has been observed and d is the arc length on the stellar photosphere between the two positions of the starspot. Using this equation, we can calculate the rotational velocity of the star at the star-spot latitude and compare it with that measured with other techniques (for example by modelling a periodic photometric modulation in the light curve induced by a star-spot activity). This will tell us if the same star-spot may have been observed after consecutive transits or after some orbital cycles, presuming that in the latter case the star has performed one or more complete revolutions. A proper modelling and accurate analysis of the size, contrast and position of two star-spots, detected in two very close transit events, can therefore reveal that we are  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berdyugina (2005)</ref>. The errorbars have been suppressed for clarity, except for WASP-52 (black dot; this work). Note that some stars appear twice or more.</p><p>actually dealing with the same star-spot (e.g. see the case of WASP-19 discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tregloan-Reed et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>In our case, we are dealing with WASP-52 A, whose rotational velocity was estimated to be Prot = 11.8 ± 3.3 d ( <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>). Based on the measurement of λ by <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref>, we can exclude that WASP-52 b is moving on a retrograde orbit. We have detected four starspots in four different transits, in a timespan of 43 d, which is consistent with the lifetime of a large star-spot (see Sect. 3.2.2). For the case n = 0, the star would rotate unrealistically slowly. Instead, the case n = 1 is very reasonable since it implies a rotational period of the star of Prot = 15.53 ± 1.96 d at co-latitude of 43 • .2 ± 4 • .9 if we consider the star-spots detected in t1 and t2. This value is consistent with those coming from considering the star-spots detected in t2 and t3, and in t3 and t4, i.e. Prot = 15.10±1.27 d at co-latitude of 45 • .2 ± 3 • .0 and 13.44 ± 1.01 d at a colatitude of 44 • .9 ± 2 • .9, respectively. Under the assumption that we have detected the same star-spot, we can simply estimate the sky-projected angle between the stellar rotation and the planetary orbit to be λ = 1 • .8 ± 21 • .8, 6 • .6 ± 24 • .8, 3 • .7 ± 9 • .9 for the cases t1 − t2, t2 − t3, t3 − t4, respectively. By taking the weighed mean of these values, we obtain λ = 3 • .8 ± 8 • .4, which is consistent with zero. There is a roughly 1.6 σ disagreement between our measurement of λ and that from <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>, λ = 24 •+17 −9 ). Even though our result supports a very low spin-orbit misalignment, the two measurements are quite compatible.</p><p>The detection of the same star-spot in three or more transits can in principle allow the true, rather than skyprojected, orbital alignment to be found (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nutzman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2013</ref>). In the current case we have four position measurements for one star-spot, although two are at very similar longitudes so are effectively one measurement. We fitted the four positions of the spot using a coordinate transformation between the intrinsic stellar surface and the projected surface as seen from Earth. Seven parameters (the four intrinsic longitudes of the spot, the single latitude of the spot, and the obliquity and rotation between the two coordinate systems) were fitted to eight measured quantities (the projected latitude and longitude of the spot during each of the four transits), and uncertainties determined using a simple Monte Carlo method. We found the true orbital obliquity to be ψ = 20 • ± 50 • and conclude that the available measurements are insufficient to put a strong constraint on this quantity. The spot positions are consistent with an aligned orbit, and are not consistent with a pole-on configuration. Better results could be obtained if star-spot positions could be measured at a wider range of longitudes and with increased precision in the measured latitudes, a situation which likely requires space-based data.</p><p>ψ can be also constrained by estimating the stellar spin inclination angle, i⋆, knowing the rotational period of the parent star, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">sin i⋆ = Prot (v sin i⋆) 2πR⋆ = 1.07 ± 0.40 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where we used (v sin i⋆) = 3.6 ± 0.9 km s −1 <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>). Since values &gt; 1 are unphysical, i⋆ must have a value between 1 and 0.73, i.e. between 90 • and 47 • . Then, using equation <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> from <ref type="bibr">Winn et al. (2007)</ref>, cos ψ = cos i⋆ cos i + sin i⋆ sin i cos λ,</p><p>we estimated that ψ is comprised between 6 • and 43 • , which is in agreement with our previous measurement and also excludes that WASP-52 A is in a pole-on configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">PHYSICAL PARAMETERS OF THE WASP-52 PLANETARY SYSTEM</head><p>We used the Homogeneous Studies (HSTEP) approach (see Southworth 2012 and references therein) for revising the main physical properties of the WASP-52 planetary system. First of all, we established an input set of parameters, composed of:</p><p>• rA + r b , k, i, P , which were measured from the photometric light curves (this work; see Sect. 3);</p><p>• T eff = 5000 ± 100 and [Fe/H]= 0.03 ± 0.12 measured from the spectroscopic analysis <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>);</p><p>• the velocity amplitude of the star, KA = 84.3 ± 3 m s −1 , measured from the radial velocities <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>).</p><p>The orbital eccentricity was fixed to zero. We started the analysis by estimating the radial-velocity amplitude of the planet, K b , and determining an initial set of the physical parameters of the system, in particular the stellar mass. Using various tables of stellar parameters predicted by different theoretical models (i.e. Claret Claret 2004; Y 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Demarque et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">DSEP Dotter et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">VRSS VandenBerg et al. 2006</ref>; BaSTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pietrinferni et al. 2004</ref>), we then interpolated to find the stellar radius and T eff for our provisional mass and the observed [Fe/H], over all possible ages for the star. After that, we adjusted K b in an iterative way, with the aim to maximise the agreement between the measured values of RA/a and T eff and those predicted by one of the sets of theoretical models. We ended with a set of five values for each output quantity and we considered the unweighted mean of these as the final value. They are shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Finally, we assigned two uncertainties for each of the final values: a systematic error based on the level of agreement among the values obtained using different theoretical models, and a statistical error related to the propagation of the uncertainties of the input parameters. Two parameters, ρA and g b , have no systematic error, as they can be directly estimated from observable quantities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Gyrochronological-isochronal age discrepancy</head><p>Almost all of our results, reported in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, are in good agreement with those found by <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref>. We found a slightly lower value for the stellar mass, but the two estimates are compatible within their uncertainties. However, the stellar age estimates are completely different. This fact is not a surprise as the two values were obtained using different procedures: our estimate is based on theoretical models (isochronal age, τiso), while that of <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref> comes from the star's rotation period (gyrochronological age, τgyro). It is well known that for many planetary systems, composed by a main-sequence star and a hot Jupiter, the gyrochronological age is significantly lower than the isochronal age (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pont 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lanza 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al. 2014)</ref>. This is clearly shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref>, where the two estimates for WASP-52 are plotted versus each other, together with those taken from the sample analysed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maxted et al. (2015)</ref>. More than intrinsic stellar characteristics (like temperature or metallicity), the discrepancy is reasonably attributable to the star-planet tidal interactions in some cases; tides are actually able to transfer angular momentum from the orbit of a hot Jupiter to the rotation of the parent star, which are thus 'spun up' and forced to rotate faster.</p><p>However, stellar activity can also play an important role for explaining this phenomenology. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maxted et al. (2015)</ref>, the τiso − τgyro discrepancy is particularly evident for K-type stars, like WASP-52, and some G stars. The K stars suffer a 'radius anomaly' (their size appears to be larger than predicted by standard stellar models; e.g. Popper 1997), which is correlated with their rotation rate. The increase of the rotational velocity is, in turn, directly proportional to the amount of magnetic activity. A large number of star-spots can inhibit the efficiency of energy transport by convection, and affect the physical characteristics of the photosphere and the star's rotation rate.</p><p>That said, the age of WASP-52 estimated by gyrochronology ( <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>) could be underestimated due to the presence of the close giant planet and the magnetic activity of the star, which causes it to rotate faster. On the other hand, the star is clearly quite active and this suggests a young age, in contrast with the isochronal age that we have estimated. This situation is not easy to clarify and requires more sophisticated models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VARIATION OF THE PLANETARY RADIUS WITH WAVELENGTH</head><p>The transmission spectrum of hot Jupiters is expected to show characteristic absorption features at particular wavelengths. In the visual region, some of them are due to sodium (∼ 590 nm), potassium (∼ 770 nm) and water vapour (∼ 950 nm). However, the variety of hot-Jupiter transmission spectra suggests a great deal of variation in chemistry and atmospheric dynamics, and some of them can be dominated by Mie or Rayleigh scattering (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sing et al. 2016</ref>). Using light curves taken through different passbands, we made an attempt to reconstruct the transmission spectrum of WASP-52 b. Following the approach used in previous studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Southworth et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mancini et al. 2016a</ref>), we refitted the light curves to estimate the ratio of the radii, k, whilst fixing the other photometric parameters to their best values <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Tables 2 and 5</ref>). The corresponding errorbars were calculated by performing 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. In this way, we obtained new values of k, whose errorbars do   The observations show a flat transmission spectrum to within the experimental uncertainties; the maximum planetary radius variation is between the LNIR (Baronnies telescope) and the Bessel-R (Danish telescope) bands, but the <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. Physical parameters of the planetary system WASP-52 derived in this work, compared with those from <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref>. Where two error bars are given, the first refers to the statistical uncertainties, while the second to the systematic errors. Notes. a Our estimate of the stellar age was derived from theoretical models, and that from the discovery paper was obtained from the stellar rotation period. b The Safronov number represents the ratio of the escape velocity to the orbital velocity of the planet and indicates the extent to which the planet scatters other bodies. c Our measurement of the time of mid-transit is given in BJD, while that from <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref> is in HJD. d Our values for the spin-orbit angle were derived under the hypothesis that the same star-spot complex was occulted by the planet in four close transit events. True spin-orbit angle d ψ degree 20 ± 50 -detection is 2.4 pressure scale heights 8 with a confidence level of just 2.4σ. We stress that this result is not significant and is based on light curves taken with different instruments and at different times. Moreover, unocculted star-spots can cause variations of the transit depth, which are dependent on wavelength and the amount of stellar activity at particular cycles. These variations can be particularly stronger at bluer wavelengths. We estimated the effect of unocculted star-spots on the transmission spectrum of WASP-52 b using the methodology described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sing et al. (2011)</ref>. The correction to the transit depth for unocculted star-spots is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 11</ref> for different star-spot temperatures, assuming a total dimming of 1% at a reference wavelength of 600 nm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sing et al. 2011</ref>). This effect is very small, and is well inside the observational uncertainties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In this work we reported photometric observations of eight transit events of WASP-52 b, performed using four different medium-class telescopes, located on both of Earth's hemispheres, through different optical passbands. All of the transits were observed using the defocussing technique, achieving <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The pressure scale height is defined as H = k B Teq µm gp</p><p>, where k B is the Boltzmann's constant, µm the mean molecular weight, Teq the planetary equilibrium temperature, gp the planetary surface gravity. a photometric precision of 0.51−1.79 mmag per observation. Two transits were simultaneously monitored with two different telescopes, once at the same observatory, and once in different countries. In the former case, a multi-band imaging camera was used. In total, we have presented 13 new light curves. Light-curve anomalies have been clearly noted in five transits. Considering the spectral class of the parent star, these anomalies are reasonably explained by star-spot occultation events caused by the planet during its transits. The light curves and the anomalies were modelled and their main parameters determined. Our principal results are as follows.</p><p>• We have used these new light curves, plus data taken from the literature and from the ETD archive, to refine the orbital ephemeris and the physical parameters of the WASP-52 planetary system. Our results are shown in Table 5 and are in a good agreement with those measured by <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref> (the star-spot contamination on their data was not strong enough to influence their estimation of the planetary-system parameters). The only exception is the age of the system, which is very discordant. Such a discrepancy can be explained because of the different methods used in the two analyses: we reported an age based on theoretical models, while <ref type="bibr">Hébrard et al. (2013)</ref> used gyrochronology. The isochronal age is not compatible with the activity of the star, but the gyrochronological age could be severely underestimated, as the presence of the close-in hot Jupiter and, again, stellar activity were not taken into account ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Maxted et al. 2015</ref>). This case is emblematic of the limits of the techniques currently used to estimate stellar ages.</p><p>• We carefully characterised the star-spots detected in various transits. Our best-fitting models yield measurements of their positions on the stellar disc, and their size and contrast. From these we extracted their temperature and speculate about the alignment between the planet's orbital axis and the stellar spin.</p><p>-We estimated the star-spot temperature contrast for WASP-52 and compare it with those derived from (i) the light curves of other transiting planetary systems and (ii) via other techniques. Joining the various data sets in a global picture, the dependence of the starpot temperature contrast with the spectral class is not anymore evident as in the case in which the data from transits were not considered, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>.</p><p>-We found a sky-projected orbital obliquity of λ = 3 • .8 ± 8 • .4, which is consistent with and more precise than the value found from the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect <ref type="bibr">(Hébrard et al. 2013</ref>). Using the four positions measured for the same star-spot, we were able to place a weak constraint on the true orbital obliquity: ψ = 20 • ± 50 • . To our knowledge, this is the first measurement of ψ based on only star-spot crossings.</p><p>• Since our transits were recorded through different filters at optical wavelengths, we attempted to reconstruct an optical transmission spectrum of the planet. We found a small variation, 2.4 H, of the planet's radius, but at a low significance. We conclude that the transmission spectrum of WASP-52 is flat to within the experimental errors. However, more precise and simultaneous multi-band observations are suggested to robustly confirm our finding.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

			<note place="foot" n="3"> LIGHT-CURVE ANALYSIS Since most of our light curves of the transits of WASP-52 b present star-spot crossing events, we have modelled them with a code designed for this task. From secular observations of the Sun, we know that star-spots can appear as big, single circular spots, or as a complex of several spots with different sizes. However, the quality and the sampling of the data are usually not sufficient for detecting fine structures in the star-spot anomalies. Therefore, it 2 This was done for each light curve individually. This approach does not fully capture correlated noise, but correlated noise is accounted for in the error bars of the final photometric parameters, because these are obtained from the parameters calculated from each light curve independently.

Then, each star-spot complex is modelled as a circular spot with these parameters: the longitude and co-latitude of its centre (θ and φ), its angular radius (rspot) and its contrast (ρspot), which is the ratio of the surface brightness of the star-spot with respect to the surrounding photosphere. At the same time, the geometrical parameters that are fitted are the sum and the ratio of the fractional MNRAS 000, 1-16 (2016)</note>
