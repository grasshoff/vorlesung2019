				<p>Approximately half of Sun-like stars harbor exoplanets packed within a radius of ∼0.3 AU, but the formation of these planets and why they form in only half of known systems are still not well understood. We employ a one-dimensional steady state model to gain physical insight into the origin of these close-in exoplanets. We use Shakura &amp; Sunyaev α values extracted from recent numerical simulations of protoplanetary disk accretion processes in which the magnitude of α, and thus the steady-state gas surface density, depends on the orientation of large scale magnetic fields with respect to the disk&apos;s rotation axis. Solving for the metallicity as a function of radius, we find that for fields anti-aligned with the rotation axis, the inner regions of our model disk often falls within a region of parameter space not suitable for planetesimal formation, whereas in the aligned case, the inner disk regions are likely to produce planetesimals through some combination of streaming instability and gravitational collapse, though the degree to which this is true depends on the assumed parameters of our model. More robustly, the aligned field case always produces higher concentrations of solids at small radii compared to the anti-aligned case. In the in situ formation model, this bimodal distribution of solid enhancement leads directly to the observed dichotomy in exoplanet orbital distances.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>With the recent discovery of thousands of exoplanets, we now know that stars' harboring of planets is not unique to our Solar System. Not only are exoplanets ubiquitous throughout our galaxy, but equally commonplace is the diversity of these systems. Indeed, discoveries such as hot Jupiters and super-Earths have made our own Solar System quite definitively not representative.</p><p>A prime example of systems that differ from the Solar System are those in which a large number of planets are packed into orbits smaller than ∼0.3 AU, comprising about 50% of all Sun-like systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Winn &amp; Fabrycky 2015)</ref>. What causes these systems to be so dynamically packed? One possibility is migration: planets are formed at larger orbital distances and then driven inward through angular momentum exchange with disk gas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Terquem &amp; Papaloizou 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kley &amp; Nelson 2012</ref>). Another possibility is in situ formation: planets form from gas and solids already present at small distances from the central star. For this mechanism to work, very high concentrations of solids must be present at small radii <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hansen &amp; Murray 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chiang &amp; Laughlin 2013)</ref>.</p><p>A question perhaps even more intriguing than the origin of these close-in exoplanets is how only ∼ 50% of all Sun-like systems have ended up in this configuration. If these planets do form in situ, then there should be a bimodal distribution of protoplanetary disk properties, in which ∼ 50% of disks have conditions favorable for the formation of planets at small radii, and the remaining 50% lack these conditions. In this letter, we show that the bimodal distribution of observed exoplanet orbital distances can be traced back to the orientation of large scale magnetic fields relative to jbsimon.astro@gmail.com 1 Department of Space Studies, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, CO 80302 2 Sagan Fellow the rotation axis of the protoplanetary disk from which these planets spawned. The orientation of this magnetic field fundamentally affects the accretion stresses in the disk and thus the gas surface density, which in turn affects how small solids drift through the disk and their concentration relative to the gas. As we show in the following sections, our calculations suggest that planetesimal formation is strongly favored for r 0.3AU in systems with magnetic fields oriented parallel to the disk's rotation axis. Assuming a uniform distribution of magnetic field orientations and in situ formation, this equates to 50% of systems producing exoplanets at small radii. The outline of this letter is as follows. We describe our steady-state semi-analytic model in Section 2, and then present our main results in Section 3. We wrap up with a brief discussion in Section 4.</p></div>

We define the stopping time of the solids in two separate ways, depending on the location in the disk. Inside of the snow line at 2.7 AU, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Birnstiel et al. (2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Birnstiel et al. ( , 2012</ref> and set the maximum τ by the fragmentation velocity, v frag ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">τ = 1 3α mid v frag c s 2 ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where α mid is the value of α at the disk mid-plane, where (through settling) most of the solids are concentrated.</p><p>For silicates v frag ≈ 1 m/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blum &amp; Wurm 2008)</ref>, but this velocity depends non-trivially on particle size <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blum &amp; Wurm 2008)</ref>. Here, we assume v frag = 1 m/s for the fiducial case and vary it in what follows. Outside of the snow line, we assume that particles reach mm sizes. Our reason for this assumption is two fold. First, coagulation simulations have indicated that beyond the snow line, solids can grow to larger sizes as the ice present in these solids allows for enhanced sticking and is less susceptible to fragmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Birnstiel et al. 2012</ref>). Second, sub millimeter observations show that mm size grains are prevalent at large radii in many protoplanetary disk systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Andrews et al. 2012</ref>). Thus, the snow line serves as a natural transition from smaller particles (their exact size depending on α mid ) to larger particles that are seen in observations, albeit at large radii. Thus, τ outside of the snow line is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">τ = π 2 ρ p Σ g a p ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where ρ p = 2g/cm 3 and a p = 1mm. Prior to disk dispersal, the gas surface density in the inner disk evolves on a time scale of ∼ Myr, while the local radial drift time, r/|v p |, of mm to cm-size particles is orders of magnitude shorter. We can thus assume a fixed gas profile, and compute the steady-state distribution of particles drifting radially through the gas from a large reservoir situated further out. Equation (3) then becomes,</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">rΣ g D p dZ dr − rΣ g v p Z = k.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The constant k is the radial mass flux of solids, k = ˙ M p /(2π), which we parameterize via the ratio of solid to gas accretion rates, ˙ M p / ˙ M . This ratio is a free parameter in our model, but we can estimate values based on taking equation (10) in the limit of large radial distances, assuming diffusion is weak to advection at these distances (which is borne out by our calculations), and assuming τ ≪ 1. At large r, radial drift dominates over accretion with the gas (again supported by our calculations). One can then rewrite Equation (10) to calculate ˙ M p / ˙ M as a function of Z, τ , α, dlnΣ g /dlnr, and q. The scenario we envision is a reservoir of gas at large radii with ISM values for the metallicity (Z = 0.01). We take τ = 0.1 and α = 10 −3 -10 −2 as reasonable estimates 3 at large distances, and constant α results in dlnΣ g /dlnr = -1 for our disk. For these values we find ˙</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">M p / ˙ M ≈ 0.1-1; our fidu- cial value is ˙ M p / ˙ M = 0.3 and we explore ˙ M p / ˙ M = 0.1 and ˙ M p / ˙ M = 1</formula><p>in what follows. We numerically integrate Equation (10) to determine the metallicity as a function of radius, assuming that the concentration of solids goes to zero at the inner edge of our disk, which we take to be the dust destruction radius, r in = 0.03AU (for the temperature structure assumed here); Z(r in ) = 0. Finally, at the snow line, we reduce Z by a factor of 2, following the arguments in Lodders (2003).</p><p>3 α may be higher at larger radial distances because the gas surface density drops below the ionization depth of FUV photons (see e.g., Perez-Becker &amp; Chiang 2011).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Bimodal α from the Hall Effect</head><p>A key component to our model is the dependence of α on the relative orientation of the large scale, vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the disk plane) magnetic field to the disk's rotation axis. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Numerical simulations that include all three non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects present in protoplanetary disks have shown that for r 30-60 AU, the Hall effect leads to two different states of the disk within these regions, depending on the value of Ω · B (Bai 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Simon et al. 2015b</ref>). For aligned field and angular momentum vector (i.e., Ω · B &gt; 0) and for the field strengths explored here (see below), α ∼ 0.01 within the inner disk, whereas in the anti aligned case (i.e., Ω · B &lt; 0), α ∼ 10 −4 -10 −3 (Bai 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Simon et al. 2015b</ref>).</p><p>We use the quantified α values from these numerical simulations in order to construct α(r) for our model. In particular, we fit a power-law to the α values in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Simon et al. (2015b)</ref> assuming a uniform in radius ratio of mid-plane gas to vertical magnetic pressure, β z = 10 5 . We choose this particular value because β z = 10 5 provides the largest sample of α values from recent simulations, and for reasonable gas surface density profiles (such as in the MMSN), the resulting α values correspond to ˙ M = 10 −8 M ⊙ /yr (though, here, we do the opposite and assume ˙ M = 10 −8 M ⊙ /yr and then calculate Σ g ).</p><p>Our power law fits to the α values are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">α =    6 × 10 −2 (r/AU) −0.87 Ω · B &gt; 0 &amp; r &lt; r outer 7.7 × 10 −4 (r/AU) 0.43 Ω · B &lt; 0 &amp; r &lt; r outer 3.3 × 10 −3</formula><p>r ≥ r outer (11) where r outer = 30 AU. The physical reason for assuming a single value for α (i.e., independent of magnetic field orientation) at r &gt; r outer is the relatively weaker Hall effect at these large radii, thus removing the bimodal α behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bai 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Simon et al. 2015b</ref>). We cap α at 0.05; larger values do not change our results significantly but require more radial zones for integrating the solution. Finally, we set α mid = 10 −4 everywhere (taken from recent simulations: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Simon et al. 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai 2015)</ref>, and therefore α is not allowed to go below α mid .</p><p>Solids will be concentrated towards the mid-plane and thus feel a diffusivity set by α mid . However, since these solids are swept inwards by accretion, this "viscosity" component is set by α as this parameterizes the accretion flow. This amounts to a definition of the ratio between diffusivity and accretion viscosity of ξ = α mid /α.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Conditions for Planetesimal Formation</head><p>We consider planetesimal formation to be possible if one of two criteria are satisfied, First, following the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Youdin &amp; Shu (2002)</ref>, if the metallicity increases beyond a critical value, it is possible for gravitational collapse of particles to proceed, independent of τ and without any interference from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We use Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Youdin &amp; Shu (2002)</ref> to calculate a critical surface density for solids for each magnetic field orientation. This can be easily converted to a critical metallicity, Z crit and we assume that if Z &gt; Z crit prompt planetesimal formation occurs.</p><p>If Z &lt; Z crit , planetesimal formation is still possible when the values of Z and τ fall within the allowed region of parameter space for the streaming instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Youdin &amp; Goodman 2005</ref>) to operate. This allowed space is still uncertain, but recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carrera et al. (2015)</ref> carried out a large suite of streaming instability calculations and mapped out the allowed streaming region in Z-τ space. In what follows, we include both planetesimal formation regions on plots of Z-τ space and assume that if the solution enters these regions, in situ planetesimal and planet formation occurs. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have shown that whether or not a protoplanetary disk forms planets within the region r &lt; 0.3 AU depends on the orientation of any large scale vertical magnetic field threading the disk with respect to the disk's rotation axis. The key ingredient is the dependence of the accretion stress on the product Ω · B, as mediated by the Hall effect. When Ω · B &gt; 0, the resulting α values are enhanced and in a steady state, this equates to a lower gas surface density. The opposite is true for Ω · B &lt; 0; weaker α values lead to higher gas surface densities.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that in the Ω · B &lt; 0 case, the <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Same as the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, but with v frag = 0.5m/s (top) and v frag = 2m/s (bottom). In both cases, the Ω·B &gt; 0 model allows for planetesimal creation, whereas this is only true for Ω · B &lt; 0 when v frag = 0.5m/s. Furthermore, there is always a large difference between the metallicities at small radii between the two models.</p><p>gas surface density depends more steeply on radius (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) and in fact is reasonably close to the MMSN profile (which is particularly intriguing since our own Solar System lacks tightly packed, close-in planets, in agreement with the Ω · B &lt; 0 case). Despite a larger radial drift velocity induced by this steeper profile, the shallower gas density profile still attains higher solid concentration. The reasons for this are two-fold. First, with higher α values, the co-accretion of the solids with the gas dominates over radial drift, ensuring that (given a sufficiently high ˙ M p / ˙ M ) there will always be a relatively large number of solids at small radii, regardless of the value of τ (see Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(5)</ref>). Second, the gas surface density is lower for Ω · B &gt; 0, which means it is easier to attain relatively large Z.</p><p>In most of the cases explored here, Ω · B &gt; 0 leads to sufficiently high metallicity for r &lt; 0.3 AU to cause direct gravitational collapse into planetesimals, though the degree to which this is true depends on the value of ˙ M p / ˙ M . Furthermore, the inner regions of the disk with Ω · B &lt; 0 fall within the region of parameter space where planetesimal formation is difficult, though this result is even less robust as it depends on both ˙ M p / ˙ M and v frag <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Same as the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, but with ˙ Mp/ ˙ M = 0.1 (top) and ˙ Mp/ ˙ M = 1 (bottom). The mass flux from large radial distances strongly influences both solutions. However, there is always a large difference between the metallicities at small radii between the two field configurations. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Gas surface density as a function of radius for Ω · B &gt; 0 (black, solid) and Ω · B &lt; 0 (blue, dashed). Also shown is the MMSN profile (red, dot-dashed). As denoted on the plot, coaccretion of solids with the gas flow dominates the inner regions of the disk for Ω · B &gt; 0, whereas drift dominates in the Ω · B &lt; 0 case.</p><p>(and possibly other parameters not explored here). What is robust, however, is that for Ω · B &gt; 0, the metallicity at small radii is enhanced, sometimes quite significantly, compared to Ω · B &lt; 0. 5 Higher metallicity leads to more planetesimals and of larger sizes ( <ref type="bibr">Simon et al., in prep)</ref>. Thus, even if parameters are such that both magnetic field orientations can lead to planetesimals at small radii, there remains a bimodal distribution in the number and sizes of these planetesimals. Encouragingly, pebble accretion depends on the size of the accreting planetesimals <ref type="bibr">(Kretke, private communication)</ref>, and while one would need planet accretion and dynamical models to strengthen the link between our results and exoplanet observations, the magnetic field geometry may very well be the key to explaining the dichotomy in exoplanet orbital configurations.</p></div>
