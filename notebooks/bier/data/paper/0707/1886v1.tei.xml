<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Case for a Small Exoplanet Space Telescope Mission</head><p>The Programmatic Imperative NASA has performed significant design work on coronagraph and interferometer concepts for a Terrestrial Planet Finder mission ( <ref type="bibr">Levine et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lawson et al. 2007)</ref>, and is now also considering occulter concepts. A common denominator of these design efforts is that they are driven by the need to take spectra of terrestrial planets with V ∼&gt;30. Large telescopes in the 4-8-m class are required to achieve this at visible wavelengths, or a constellation of 3-m telescopes in the thermal infrared. Missions like these are central to a full exploration of neighboring planetary systems; nothing would serve exoplanet science better than beginning one of them as soon as possible. However, all of these have the scope of a flagship mission. Without a major injection of new resources into space astronomy, it will not be possible to realize a full-scale TPF mission until many years after JWST has begun operations. Our community can either resign itself to waiting out JWST, or look for ways to achieve significant new exoplanet science, sooner, through more modest projects.</p><p>A major opportunity for observational progress is offered by smaller optical space telescopes. These platforms have strong design heritage, and provide the simplest approach to obtaining the high spatial that is needed. The science they would enable is the study of giant exoplanets around nearby stars in reflected light. At V ∼27, these targets can be detected and characterized by low-resolution spectroscopy using a space telescope in the 2-m class, making the project small enough to proceed in parallel with JWST. Such a mission is missing from NASA's current portfolio because of over-optimistic early assessments about the contrast achievable with groundbased adaptive optics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Angel 1994)</ref>, and subsequent attempts to refit HST with an advanced coronagraph. With 10 −8 now recognized as the useful contrast limit for groundbased AO ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Angel et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Guyon 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Stapelfeldt 2006</ref>) and the end of Hubble instrument opportunities, the way is clear to consider dedicated space missions targeting exo-Jupiters and the means for their implementation.</p><p>Science Reach of a 2m-class Optical Coronagraph a. Studies of Known Radial Velocity Planets. Nine nearby stars host radial velocity planets whose apastron distances project to angular separations ≥ 0.25 . These are cold objects presenting a contrast of ∼ 10 −9 in the optical and near-IR, and thus are only accessible to a space mission. Existing ephemerides allow observations to be timed to coincide with their maximum elongations. A 2-m class coronagraph could measure their colors, take spectra at R∼40, and provide astrometric measurements that will resolve the sin i ambiguity in their masses. The spectra will allow CH 4 and NH 3 to be identified in the atmospheres, and the depth of the uppermost cloud deck to be measured. The planets' albedo and presence of bright ring systems can be inferred using the observed photometry and planet sizes estimated from their measured masses. Multi-epoch imaging showing the planetary orbital motions will make a powerful visual impression of the reality of exoplanetary systems in the public mind.</p><p>b. Discovery of New Giant Planet Companions. Radial velocity surveys are incomplete for orbital periods &gt; 8 years, for early F and hotter stars lacking strong metallic lines in their spectra, for stars with high chromospheric activity, and for planets in nearly face-on orbits. Multi-epoch imaging with a 2-m class coronagraph has the potential to discover new Jovian planets in 5-10 AU orbits around as many as 200 nearby stars. There are 30 stars within 25 pc distance that host close-in radial velocity planets, and which would be prime targets for an outer planet search. Spectral characterization of the detected objects would also be carried out.</p><p>c. Debris Disks and Exozodiacal Dust. Circumstellar dust disks are maintained by ongoing collisions in belts of asteroidal and cometary parent bodies. In addition to revealing the location of these belts, debris disks act as a canvas on which unseen planets can impress dynamical signatures. A 2-m class coronagraph provides the 0.1 spatial resolution needed to resolve the rings, warps, and asymmetries driven by planetary perturbations in these disks. With contrast improved ∼ 1000 times over HST, it also will be sensitive enough to detect disks as tenuous as our own Kuiper Belt, enabling comparative studies of dust inventory and properties across stellar ages and spectral types.</p><p>d. Terrestrial Planets. For 5-10 of the brightest and nearest stars, the inner working angle of a 2-m class optical telescope may be good enough to allow detection of Earthsized planets within the habitable zone, and to spectrally characterize them using broadband photometry. These results would provide a foretaste and motivation for a full-scale TPF mission to follow. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Technical Overview</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wavefront Control</head><p>Precision wavefront control is the key enabling technology for ultra-high contrast imaging. It is impractical to polish a large optic to the smoothness required to directly detect exoplanets. Instead, deformable mirror(s) are used to actively correct the telescope midspatial frequency wavefront to the very high accuracy of λ/1000. In a space environment these corrections are expected to be highly stable on timescales of days, unlike the 10 ms timescales typical for groundbased adaptive optics. Over the past six years this technique has been developed in the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at NASA/JPL, to the point where contrasts of 10 −9 are now achieved at radii of 4-10 λ/D in bandpasses of 2%, and a noise level from image to image of about 0.1 Earth or 0.01 Jupiter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Trauger &amp; Traub 2007)</ref>. This level of wavefront correction is achieved in a restricted in a "dark hole" region of the image field whose spatial frequencies can be controlled by the finite deformable mirror. Such mirrors are already available in a 64×64 format that can support an exoJupiter mission. Work continues to refine the algorithms used to find the optimal wavefront solution, and to reduce instrumental chromatism so that broader bandpass corrections can be achieved. The key point is that the level of wavefront control needed to support 10 −9 image contrast is close to being realized. The testbed effort has been supported by the TPF project, which has requirements 10 times more stringent than an exoJupiter coronagraph mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Telescope Requirements</head><p>The use of active wavefront corrections means that the telescope primary does not need to be manufactured with extraordinary surface quality. Instead, the key telescope requirement is mechanical stability. The primary mirror must be protected from thermal stresses through the use of proper materials, temperature regulation, and shielding from outside thermal disturbances. Primary-secondary alignment must be carefully maintained, both to keep the pupil image on the deformable mirror and to minimize focus drifts. The inner working angle (IWA) that the telescope provides to a coronagraphic instrument is determined by the alignment stability that can be achieved. For 10 −9 contrast, the usable IWA is believed to be 3.5 λ/D for a large (∼ 8-m) telescope, but might be as small as 2.5 λ/D for a smaller, stiffer system. While it would be highly desirable to image planets at even smaller angular separations, the telescope alignment tolerances needed to enable operation at &lt; 2 λ/D are thought to be prohibitive. Continued investigation of the limiting IWA issues will be crucial for defining the sample of terrestrial planets a 2-m class telescope might reach. The size of the telescope strongly affects the number of stars that can be studied, as D 3 . A monolithic, unobscured (off-axis) telescope design is preferable, as it maximizes throughput and substantially simplifies diffraction control requirements. Silver optical coatings would be used to maximize system throughput between 0.5-1.0 µm, and the reflectivity across the pupil should be uniform to within 0.1% or significant wavefront errors would be introduced. A program to develop a 1.8-m primary mirror meeting these requirements was begun by the TPF project, but then suspended due to funding cuts. The re-initiation of this Technology Demonstration Mirror (TDM) effort would be highly beneficial to the early realization of an exoJupiter coronagraph mission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction Control</head><p>A wealth of options are available to suppress stellar diffraction to the levels needed to image exoJupiters. A traditional Lyot coronagraph has been employed in the JPL laboratory demonstrations, focusing on graded masks that are insensitive to low-order telescope aberrations (band-limited masks). Masks made from HEBS glass have been used, but wavelengthdependent phase shifts in this material may be limiting the achievable bandwidth. Promising alternative mask materials are under investigation. A drawback of the Lyot coronagraphs is their relatively low throughputs &lt; 40% and loss of resolution at the Lyot stop -even for unobscured apertures. An alternative coronagaph design, dubbed Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (or PIAA), offers much higher throughput and spatial resolution close to that of the unobscured aperture (Guyon 2005a). It is now undergoing initial laboratory demonstration. Instead of blocking the on-axis starlight, a third option is to null it out using a copy of the input beam shifted in phase by 180 degrees. Subsystem laboratory testing has been done on the nulling coronagraph (Shao 2004), and it will be the focus of an upcoming sounding rocket experiment. A fourth option is the finely tailored "shaped pupil" designs that can strongly suppress diffraction along preferred directions in the image plane. Finally, an external occulter formation-flying thousands of kilometers from the telescope represents still another type of coronagraph. This is likely to be a costly exoJupiter mission option, however, because the expense of a second independent spacecraft would outweigh the savings in telescope and wavefront control requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Backend Instruments</head><p>Characterization of exoJupiters in reflected light requires an imager and spectrograph that operate over the wavelength range 0.5-0.95 µm. Existing low-noise optical CCDs would be sufficient as the detectors, and the required format would be relatively small (512 or 1024 square). A spectral imaging instrument (Integral Field Unit) would be ideal, to enable si-multaneous detection, spectral characterization, and speckle rejection. Other configurations such as a staring camera with filter wheel, dichroic separation into multiple simultaneous imaging channels, a long-slit spectrograph, or the long-sought energy-discriminating detectors could also be employed. The optimal instrument approach will strongly depend on the bandwidth that is achieved by the wavefront correction system. The science camera will also be used to carry out the crucial function of wavefront sensing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spacecraft and Mission Design</head><p>The spacecraft must provide a quiet and stable platform for the telescope payload while handling routine functions such as power, data handling, communications, and attitude control. Pointing would be done through a combination of coarse spacecraft body control, and fine steering of the stellar target onto the occulting spot using internal instrument mirrors. To minimize thermal disturbances to the telescope that would induce alignment instability, an Earth-trailing or L2 orbit is preferred. Studies to date suggest that a 2-m class payload can be injected into these orbits using a Delta II class launcher. If sent to L2, the spacecraft would require an on-board propulsion system for orbit maintenance. A mission lifetime of 3-5 years is required to search for outer planets with 12-20 year orbital periods; this gives the planets enough time to move from inferior conjunction to maximum elongation, where they will be bright and well-separated from their parent star.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A New Programmatic Approach</head><p>A 2-m class coronagraphic space telescope is an important first step toward the goal of directly imaging and spectrally characterizing planetary systems around nearby stars like the Sun. It would produce important science, set the stage for subsequent TPF missions, and is close to technical readiness. Unfortunately, NASA lacks a programmatic avenue that would allow this class of mission to go forward. The NASA Navigator Program currently encompasses only groundbased efforts, SIM, and the large TPF missions; no provision has been made for "probe" missions of intermediate scale. The community has tried to overcome this omission, with several groups repeatedly proposing 1.2-1.8-m coronagraphic telescopes to the NASA Discovery Program. These have consistently been declined, primarily on the basis of cost. The situation is at an impasse: unless something is done, direct imaging of planetary systems like our own will be left waiting more than a decade for the coveted flagship missions, and unable to pursue important, more affordable missions that could be realized on a 5 year timescale. The NASA New Frontiers Program represents the mission class ($650 M) that could support the scope of a 1.5-2-m coronagraphic telescope. A specific exoplanet probe mission opportunity like this is urgently needed under the auspices of the Navigator Program. In such a vehicle, a 2-m class coronagraph could be weighed against other exoplanet probe mission concepts, with an open competition for the best instrumental approaches. It is urgent that the Exoplanet Task Force consider this or other options that would enable near-term progress in the direct detection of nearby planetary systems like our own.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Left: Simulated coronagraphic image of a nearby planetary system, with Jovian planets and an inner 5 zodi dust ring as might be seen in VRI bandpasses with a 1.8-m telescope.
