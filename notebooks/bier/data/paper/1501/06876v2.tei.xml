			<abstract>
				<p>We investigate the chemical stability of CO 2-dominated atmospheres of desiccated M dwarf terrestrial exoplanets using a 1-dimensional photochemical model. Around Sun-like stars, CO 2 photolysis by Far-UV (FUV) radiation is balanced by recombination reactions that depend on water abundance. Planets orbiting M dwarf stars experience more FUV radiation, and could be depleted in water due to M dwarfs&apos; prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequences (Luger &amp; Barnes 2015). We show that, for water-depleted M dwarf terrestrial planets, a catalytic cycle relying on H 2 O 2 photolysis can maintain a CO 2 atmosphere. However, this cycle breaks down for atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios &lt;1 ppm, resulting in ~40% of the atmospheric CO 2 being converted to CO and O 2 on a time scale of 1 Myr. The increased O 2 abundance leads to high O 3 concentrations, the photolysis of which forms another CO 2-regenerating catalytic cycle. For atmospheres with &lt;0.1 ppm hydrogen, CO 2 is produced directly from the recombination of CO and O. These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of ~50% on the amount of CO 2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to generate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O 2 and O 3. The conditions that lead to such high oxygen levels could be widespread on planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Discrimination between biological and abiotic O 2 and O 3 in this case can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in the reflectance and emission spectra of these planets, which necessitates observations at wavelengths longer than 0.95 µm.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>M dwarfs are prime targets for the detection and characterization of terrestrial exoplanets by the James Webb Space Telescope, as they are abundant in the solar neighborhood and their small radii allow for greater transit signals from Earth-sized exoplanets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Quintana et al. 2014</ref>). As a result, terrestrial exoplanets in orbit of M dwarfs may offer the best opportunities for the detection of biosignatures in the near future, such as O 2 and O 3 . However, these species are also produced by CO 2 photolysis, leading to potential false positives in biosignature detection.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that low H 2 O, high CO 2 atmospheres tend to generate more O 2 and O 3 , though the conclusions are very sensitive to surface boundary conditions and atmospheric escape rates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Selsis et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zahnle et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tian et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2014</ref>).</p><p>Recent works by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Luger &amp; Barnes (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Tian &amp; Ida (2015)</ref> have shown that M dwarf terrestrial exoplanets may be severely depleted in water relative to Earth. Prior to the Main Sequence, M dwarfs evolve along the Hayashi Track for 100 Myr -1 Gyr with much higher luminosities than later in their evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hayashi 1961)</ref>. Therefore, any planets in the habitable zone of a main sequence M dwarf would experience a prolonged period of high insolation before the main sequence, leading to a Runaway Greenhouse phase and the loss of much of their atmospheric and surficial water. Their crust and upper mantle could also become desiccated if a surface magma ocean forms as a result of the Runaway Greenhouse, in which case they could be heavily oxidized by acting as a sink for the excess oxygen generated by water photolysis and hydrogen escape <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Luger &amp; Barnes 2015)</ref>. Such planets would be vastly different from Earth in terms of atmospheric chemistry and subsequent evolution. For example, the low atmospheric water content, whether as a result of the initial global desiccation or low water outgassing rates due to the desiccation of the mantle, could lead to high abundances of abiotic O 2 and O 3 in the event that the remaining atmosphere is dominated by outgassed CO 2 .</p><p>The stability of CO 2 in terrestrial planet atmospheres depends on a balance between destruction by Far-UV (FUV) radiation (λ ~ 121 -200 nm) from their host stars in the upper atmosphere via (R1) and regeneration through the following catalytic cycle in the lower atmosphere:</p><p>(R2) (R3) (R4) ---------------------------------,</p><p>where M is a third body, and the HO x species ( = H + OH + HO 2 ) are derived from H 2 O, with small contributions from H 2 O 2 photolysis by Near-UV (NUV) radiation (λ ~ 300 -400 nm). This process is usually faster than the spin-forbidden regeneration reaction .</p><p>S1 is currently active on Mars and Venus <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(McElroy &amp; Donahue 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">McElroy et al. 1973</ref>), which explains their CO 2 -dominated atmospheres despite photolysis by Solar FUV.</p><p>However, M dwarfs produce much lower NUV relative to FUV due to their lower effective temperatures and intense stellar activity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tian et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">West et al. 2004</ref>), which would reduce the efficiency of S1 while not affecting, or even increasing R1. Furthermore, if the atmospheric water content were low, as is possibly the case for terrestrial exoplanets in the M dwarf habitable zone, then S1 would be reduced even further. Previous studies that investigated CO 2 photochemistry either assumed present/young Sun-like host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Selsis et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zahnle et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hu et al. 2012</ref>) and/or ocean worlds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tian et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Domagal-Goldman et al. 2014</ref>). In this work, we explore the stability of CO 2 on a desiccated planet around an M dwarf and consider the potential for false positive detections of O 2 and O 3 as biosignatures.</p><p>In Section 2 we give a brief summary of the 1-dimensional photochemical model we use to obtain our results, as well as describe the construction of our model atmosphere and the specific cases we considered regarding atmospheric hydrogen content. We present our results for the stability of CO 2 atmospheres in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss the possibility for false positive detections of biosignatures, as well as consider the effects of temperature variations, clouds, hydrogen escape, and interactions between the atmosphere and the surface. We offer our conclusions in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Photochemical and Transport Model</head><p>We use the Caltech/JPL 1-Dimensional Photochemical model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al. 1981)</ref>, as modified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref> for the Martian atmosphere.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allen et al. (1981)</ref> for a detailed description of the general photochemical model and <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 2</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref> for the full list of reactions and associated rate constants (with minor updates) considered in our model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 1</ref> gives a subset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref>'s reactions that are significant to this work. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1</ref> shows a comparison between the solar spectrum <ref type="bibr">(WMO 1985)</ref>, and a spectrum of the M dwarf GJ 436 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">France et al. (2013)</ref> that we use for our model, scaled such that the total flux of each star is equal to the total solar flux at 1 AU, ~1360 W m -2 . In addition, we show the wavelengths at which photolysis of CO 2 , O 2 , O 3 , and H 2 O 2 is most efficient. It is clear that the GJ 436 spectrum features a much higher FUV/NUV ratio than Sun-like stars, and as a result the photolysis rates of the four aforementioned species will differ between the two cases. The entire spectral range used in the model is ~100 to 800 nm. We assume that the spectrum of the star is fixed throughout the duration of our simulations. This ignores the effects of major flaring events or quiet periods, which we assume to be irrelevant on long time scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Boundary Conditions</head><p>The choice of boundary conditions strongly affects the resulting atmospheric composition. The major processes that are typically modeled include hydrogen escape, volcanic outgassing, and surface deposition of oxidants. The rates of these processes, especially the latter two, are highly uncertain. For example, the outgassing flux of water for Earth is 10 11 -10 12 cm -2 s -1 (Fischer 2008), while on Venus it could be as low as 5.5 × 10 5 -10 7 cm -2 s -1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Walker et al. 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grinspoon 1993)</ref>. This is likely due to the hydrodynamic loss of water in Venus's past <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hamano et al. 2013</ref>), similar to the conditions experienced by our modeled M dwarf exoplanet.</p><p>Likewise, the deposition velocity of oxidants, such as O 2 and O 3 , is strongly tied to surface composition and water content. On Earth and Mars, aqueous reactions of molecular oxygen and ozone with ferrous iron, sulfides, and other reducing species act as significant sinks for oxidants, but deposition velocities on Mars could be 10 -100 times lower than on Earth due to the reduced surface humidity and differences in surface composition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zahnle et al. 2008</ref>). Therefore, given that our modeled planet could be drier still, and that the crust and upper mantle may already be heavily oxidized, the deposition of oxidants could be severely limited.</p><p>If hydrogen escape is in the diffusion-limited regime, then the flux can be expressed as <ref type="formula">(1</ref> As M dwarfs emit abundant XUV (λ &lt; 121 nm) radiation and highly charged particles that can cause hydrodynamic escape and sputtering, the rate of hydrogen loss could readily reach the diffusion-limited regime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cohen et al. 2015</ref>), though sputtering could be reduced if a strong planetary magnetic field exists ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lammer et al. 2007</ref>). On the other hand, the abundance of hydrogen above the homopause is strongly tied to the rate of production from photolysis of water and H 2 O 2 , as well as chemistry in the ionosphere ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994</ref>). Thus, in the limit of low atmospheric hydrogen content, the hydrogen escape flux could be much lower than the diffusionlimited flux.</p><p>Given the possibility that the outgassing, deposition, and escape fluxes may be low, we will simplify the problem and focus strictly on the effects of high UV flux, low water content, and high CO 2 -content by assigning zero fluxes to all species for our upper and lower boundary conditions. We make an exception for ions, which have a zero flux upper boundary condition and a fixed concentration of 0 cm -3 at the lower boundary to simulate recombination with electrons at the surface ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994)</ref>. This is equivalent to hydrogen escape being balanced by the outgassing of water, with the outgassed oxygen atoms being lost through surface deposition of oxidants. These simplified boundary conditions, which are potentially representative of desiccated terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, will be evaluated in section 4.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Model Atmosphere</head><p>In order to model a CO 2 -dominated atmosphere we simulate Mars-like atmospheric composition with a surface atmospheric pressure of 1 bar for an Earth-sized planet with Earth's surface gravity. We keep the same (Martian) mixing ratios of atmospheric species as <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref>. The pressure P, temperature T, and eddy diffusion coefficient K zz profiles are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The model atmosphere extends from the surface to 100 km altitude with an altitude bin thickness of 1 km. The pressure profile is calculated assuming an ideal gas atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium.</p><p>The temperature profile is split into the troposphere, the stratosphere/mesosphere, and the thermosphere. The troposphere is assumed to be a dry adiabat with the heat capacity of CO 2 as a function of temperature taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">McBride &amp; Gordon (1961)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Woolley (1954)</ref>. The surface temperature is assumed to be 240 K, accounting for the warming due to 1 bar of CO 2 (Kasting 1991). The temperature decreases along the adiabat with increasing altitude until it reaches the planetary skin temperature of 139 K, identical to that of Mars, by assumption ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994)</ref>.</p><p>This places the tropopause of our atmosphere at ~7.5 km. Above the tropopause the temperature profile is assumed to be isothermal, consistent with previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kasting 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Segura et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2007</ref>). The temperature increases in the thermosphere above 60 km due to inefficient collisional cooling, and the temperatures are calculated by assuming that the temperature-pressure relationship is identical in the thermospheres of both our model atmosphere and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref>'s model atmosphere. This assumption is valid given the density (and thus pressure) dependence of collisional cooling ( <ref type="bibr">López-Puertas &amp; Taylor 2001, pp. 77)</ref>. As the pressure profile depends on the temperature profile, we iterate between the two until convergence.</p><p>The eddy diffusion coefficient as a function of altitude is calculated assuming free convection <ref type="bibr">(Gierasch &amp; Conrath 1985, pp. 121)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> where H is the scale height given by , R is the universal gas constant, σ is the StefanBoltzmann constant, µ is the atmospheric molecular weight, which is assumed to be identical to that of CO 2 , ρ is the atmospheric mass density, C p is the atmospheric heat capacity, and L is the mixing length defined with respect to the convective stability of the atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> where Γ is the lapse rate and Γ a is the adiabatic lapse rate. As with <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001)</ref>, we set a lower bound for L of 0.1H in the radiative regions of the atmosphere. Using equations 1 and 2, we find a surface eddy diffusion coefficient value of 3.4 × 10 7 cm 2 s -1 , which is more than twice as high as in previous studies where a value of 10 5 cm 2 s -1 is often used (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2007</ref>). This is likely due to the equations' assumption of free convection breaking down in the presence of a solid surface. Therefore, we scale the entire profile by a constant factor such that the surface value is 10 5 cm 2 s -1 .</p><p>The temperature, pressure, and eddy diffusion coefficient profiles are held constant with time throughout the simulation, even when the atmospheric composition changes drastically. We will discuss how a self-consistent atmospheric model may impact our results in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Atmospheric Hydrogen and Oxygen Content</head><p>The hydrodynamic loss of water leads to an atmosphere depleted in hydrogen, which is mostly bound in H 2 and H 2 O in our model. To simulate such depletion we decrease the initial water content of the atmosphere such that it is undersaturated at all altitudes. Using the expression of <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lindner (1988)</ref> for the temperature-dependent saturation vapor pressure of water we find the minimum value of the saturation water vapor mixing ratio of our model atmosphere to be 1.675 × 10 -5 ppm at the tropopause, where the temperature is 139 K. We then vary the H 2 content to investigate the result of different degrees of hydrogen depletion in the atmosphere. We simulate six cases, with total atmospheric H mole fractions f(H) tot of <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>  We assume that the excess oxygen produced from water depletion is taken up by the crust and upper mantle during the Runaway Greenhouse phase, when a magma ocean may have formed on the surface that would have acted as an extremely efficient oxygen sink <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Luger &amp; Barnes;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hamano et al. 2013</ref>). The resulting atmosphere would then be low in oxygen, while the crust and upper mantle compensate by being oxidized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>Despite the low water content of our model atmosphere, &gt;50% of the atmospheric CO 2 present at the beginning of our simulations is retained. We find that this results from the actions  mixing ratios also decrease, while the O 3 mixing ratio increases. This trend is better seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>, which shows the column-averaged mixing ratios of the same species as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, as a function of the atmospheric hydrogen content. There is a clear trend of decreasing CO 2 with decreasing atmospheric hydrogen, eventually reaching a lower limit for cases with hydrogen mixing ratio ~1 ppm. The high abiotic O 2 and CO concentrations of our atmospheres (5 -20%</p><p>and 10 -40%, respectively) are consistent with previous studies showing the propensity for planets with low atmospheric H 2 O abundance to lose more CO 2 to photolysis than planets with high atmospheric H 2 O abundance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Segura et al. 2007</ref>). However, we do not lose as much CO 2 as the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zahnle et al. (2008)</ref>, which showed that an atmosphere as depleted in water as ours (~0.6 precipitable microns for our "wettest" case) should be unstable to conversion to CO if irradiated by a Sun-like star. This suggests the existence of alternate chemical pathways aside from S1 that are responsible for regenerating CO 2 in low H 2 O, initially CO 2 -dominated atmospheres of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. These chemical pathways must be such that (1) CO 2 still dominates even when H 2 O concentrations are low, and (2) CO 2 is stopped from complete conversion to CO and O 2 even when atmospheric hydrogen is severely depleted. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> shows the rates of several key reactions near the surface of the planet as the hydrogen content of the atmosphere is reduced from panels 1 to 6, which correspond to Cases 1 to 6, respectively, as well as the points on the column-averaged mixing ratio curves of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>As catalytic cycles require one reaction to feed into another, the reactions that make up the cycle must all have the same effective reaction rate, determined by the rate-limiting step. Thus, for</p><p>Case 1, R2, R4, R6, and R7 form a catalytic cycle below 20 km: As the atmospheric hydrogen content is decreased from Cases 1 to 3 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>, the mixing ratios of H 2 O 2 and HO 2 decrease (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>), resulting in a drop in the rates of R6 and R7. Consequently, S2 becomes less efficient at regenerating CO 2 . This leads to the decrease in CO 2 and the increase in CO and O 2 shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>, which in turn results in the increase in O 3 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(R2) (R7) (R6) (R4) --------------------------------- .<label>(S2</label></formula><p>The rise of ozone increases the rate of R8 and its own photolysis reaction R9, which produces an abundance of free oxygen atoms that go into increasing the rate of R5. Eventually, R8 replaces R6 and R7 in S2, forming</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(R2) (R8) (R4) --------------------------------- ,<label>(S3)</label></formula><p>which, together with R5, dominates the CO 2 regeneration process below 15 km. Case 3 shows the switch from S2 to S3 and R5, where neither process is particularly efficient; this causes the minimum in the CO 2 mixing ratio curve in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>. The increase in O 3 concentrations goes on to increase the rates of S3 and R5 in Cases 4 to 6, which in turn explains the upswing in the CO 2 mixing ratio seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref> for the cases with atmospheric hydrogen content &lt;0.1 ppm. hydrogen/water cases is given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 6</ref>, which shows molecular fluxes from Case 1 (top) and For the cases where the atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratio is &lt;0.05 ppm, as in Cases 5 and 6 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>, R5 dominates and S3 is reduced, due to low HO 2 and OH concentrations.</p><p>Further decreases in atmospheric hydrogen content are inconsequential since R5 does not depend on any hydrogen species.</p><p>The importance of H 2 O 2 and O 3 photolysis for S2, S3, and R5 means our results would differ significantly for similar planets around Sun-like stars. Aside from the lack of a prolonged high luminosity pre-main sequence phase, Sun-like stars also emit more strongly in the NUV, resulting in higher rates of H 2 O 2 and O 3 photolysis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 1)</ref>. Therefore, only a small amount of H 2 O 2 and O 3 is necessary to produce the photolysis products needed to regenerate CO 2 . An alternate simulation of Case 6 that uses a Solar spectrum rather than an M dwarf spectrum yields ~2% O 2 and 4% CO, consistent with the results of previous works that used solar spectra (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hu et al. 2012</ref>). Though these values are lower than our nominal results, they are still ~100 times higher than that of a non-desiccated planet orbiting a Sun-like star, such as</p><p>Earth during the Proterozoic eon ( <ref type="bibr">Planavski et al. 2014</ref>). This suggests that false positive detections of biosignatures are possible even for desiccated planets around Sun-like stars. These results are also similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. (1994)</ref> when they only used R5 for CO 2 regeneration, though there is more CO 2 remaining at equilibrium in our case due to the higher atmospheric density, which increases the rate of R5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Surface Fluxes and Atmospheric Escape</head><p>We have assumed zero-flux boundary conditions for all neutral species in our model atmosphere in order to simplify the problem and focus on the effects of high UV flux, low water content, and high CO 2 -content. This is equivalent to assuming that all fluxes are nonzero, though its high abundance in the drier cases may increase its significance (see below).</p><p>Comparisons between the zero-flux and explicit flux models are done using our wettest and driest cases, Cases 1 and 6, respectively. All other run parameters of the models are identical to the corresponding zero-flux cases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref> shows the comparison between the mixing ratios derived from the explicit flux model (dashed curves) and that derived from our nominal model (solid curves), for Cases 1 (red) and 6 (blue). There is satisfactory agreement between the two models for almost all of the species, including those vital to the catalytic cycles outlined in Section 3. The major difference between the two models is the reservoir of atmosphere hydrogen. For the zero-flux case, the reservoirs are H 2 and H 2 O 2 , while in the explicit flux model the hydrogen reservoir is water. This is understandable since water is being actively replenished by outgassing, and the production of H and H 2 is dependent on the H 2 O abundance. This leads to a slight decrease in H and H 2 mixing ratios, which further leads to the minor differences in the abundances of the other species. Case 1 is similar to that of Venus (5.5 × 10 5 -10 7 cm -2 s -1 ), while that of Case 6 is an order of magnitude lower than the given lower limit of the Venus water outgassing flux ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Walker et al. 1970</ref>). By analogy this could mean that volcanism rates, and thus heat fluxes, are relatively high, but the water content of the lava is much lower. This is consistent with a desiccated upper mantle that lost its hydrogen during the early runaway greenhouse-induced magma ocean phase water of 17% for their Mars model, which is 320 times higher than the relative humidity for our Case 1 results, and 8.5 × 10 5 times higher than that of our Case 6 results. Therefore, it is plausible that our deposition velocities are low due to the lack of an aqueous medium within which oxidation can proceed quickly. However, the exact relationship between O 3 deposition velocity and relative humidity is unknown, especially for very low water abundances.</p><p>Alternatively, the planetary surface may be low in ferrous iron and sulfides due to the oxidation resulting from burial of hundreds of bars of oxygen during the aforementioned magma ocean phase. deposition.</p><p>These calculations show that terrestrial planets that have experienced severe loss of water and oxidization of the crust and upper mantle, such as planets orbiting in the habitable zones of M dwarfs, can potentially possess an atmosphere similar to our zero-flux results provided that CO 2 is abundant in their atmospheres. Consequently, biosignature false positives may be prevalent for planets orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarfs, and should be taken into consideration in future studies and observation campaigns, as we discuss below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Biosignature False Positives</head><p>Our results show that O 2 mixing ratios of ~20% and <ref type="formula">O</ref>   comparison. We see immediately that not only are our three cases difficult to separate, but all three cases are very different from Earth's atmosphere as seen in the mid-IR. This is mostly due to the completely different temperature profile assumed and the lack of water vapor, which absorbs at 6.3 and beyond 18 µm, though there is a slight decrease in flux at 6.3 µm for our wettest case (Case 1). Our model atmosphere also lacks methane, which absorbs at 7.7 µm. All spectra feature a deep 15-µm CO 2 band, though it is deeper for our model atmosphere due to the cooler stratosphere. Finally, there is weak O 3 absorption at 9.7 µm that gets progressively stronger as our model atmosphere becomes drier, but it never approaches the strength of O 3 absorption in Earth's atmosphere. The weakness of this absorption is caused by the emission occurring near the surface, such that the brightness temperature of the O 3 absorption is similar to the surface temperature, which sets the continuum on either side of the absorption feature. Thus, from the thermal emission there is a clear distinction between actual Earth-like planets and those with abundant atmospheric O 2 and O 3 caused by low water content and photolysis. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the normalized reflectance of the same cases as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 8</ref> compared to the reflectance of Earth, again generated by SMART and the VPL Earth model, respectively. A grey surface albedo of 0.15 is assumed for our model planet. We see that the O 3 in our model atmosphere can be detected via deep O 3 absorption in the NUV similar in strength to O 3 absorption in Earth's atmosphere, and our driest case (Case 6) even features a deeper Chappuis band (~0.6 µm) than Earth. However, whereas all of our cases exhibit a smooth fall-off in reflectance past 0.7 µm, punctuated by CO 2 absorption, Earth's reflectance in this region is dominated by water absorption, and thus water again acts as the discriminating species between Earth and our model planet.</p><p>From these comparisons it is clear that the condition necessary to produce abundant O 2</p><p>and O 3 in CO 2 -dominated atmospheres -low water content -leads to a clear distinction in planetary spectra from those of Earth-like planets via the disappearance of strong water vapor absorption bands. Thus, biologically active, Earth-like planets can be distinguished from the planetary environments presented here using the 0.95 µm water vapor band, the numerous water bands throughout the near infrared, or, in the thermal infrared, the 6.3 µm water band, which are all observable by JWST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beichman et al. 2014</ref>). However, caution must be exercised, as highaltitude cloud cover could potentially mask spectral signatures of water vapor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Atmospheric Evolution</head><p>In our calculations we fix the pressure, temperature, and eddy diffusion coefficient profiles. As we have shown, considerable atmospheric evolution occurs over the 10 Gyr duration of each simulation, including the formation of a significant O 3 layer comparable to that of Earth and the conversion of ~40% of the atmospheric CO 2 into CO and O 2 . Furthermore, the liberation of CO and O from CO 2 increases the total number of molecules in the atmosphere, but this should be balanced by the decrease of the molecular weight of the atmosphere from ~44 g mol -1</p><p>to ~37 g mol -1 , thereby increasing the scale height such that local number densities should remain constant. The O 3 layer in the stratosphere should raise the temperature such that a temperature inversion results due to heating by photolysis, much like in Earth's stratosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Park &amp; London 1974)</ref>. The decrease in CO 2 should result in warming of the stratosphere and mesosphere due to lower rates of radiative cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Roble &amp; Dickinson 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brasseur &amp; Solomon 2005)</ref>, as well as a cooling of the troposphere due to decreased greenhouse effects.</p><p>Finally, the increase in O 2 should result in heating by photolysis in the mesosphere and thermosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Park &amp; London 1974)</ref>. In all, the temperature profile should increase above the tropopause and evolve in shape towards that of Earth, while below the tropopause the temperature will likely decrease.</p><p>The reaction rates will change in response to these temperature variations, as most of the reaction rate constants are exponential functions of inverse temperature <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>. Of the chemical reactions considered here, R2 (low pressure limit), R3, and R7 have rate constants that are inversely proportional to temperature, while R2 (high pressure limit), R4, R5, and R8 have rate constants that are directly proportional to temperature. Of the photolysis reactions, R1 decreases for decreasing temperatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schmidt et al. 2013</ref>) and R6 varies negligibly with temperature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nicovich &amp; Wine 1988</ref>). Photolysis of O 2 and O 3 (R9) decrease slightly with decreasing temperatures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hudson et al. 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lean and Blake 1981)</ref>.</p><p>The combination of the temperature changes and the response of the reaction rates seem to suggest that (1) CO 2 destruction will increase as temperature increases in the stratosphere, (2) CO 2 regeneration via S2 and S3 will decrease due to decreasing temperatures in the troposphere, and (3) CO 2 regeneration via R5 will also decrease, again due to the cooler troposphere. In other words, the atmosphere may lose much more CO 2 if the temperature evolution were taken into account. Quantitatively verifying these hypotheses require running coupled photochemistry and radiative transfer models, which is beyond the scope of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Condensation</head><p>For many of our cases, H 2 O is supersaturated in the stratosphere/mesosphere by the end of the 10 Gyr model run due to equilibration among the different hydrogen species. The formation of ice clouds would affect the UV radiation environment in the lower atmosphere, but whether the UV is enhanced or attenuated depends on location above or below the clouds, the solar zenith angle, cloud particle properties and distribution, and cloud optical depth. Typical variations in UV intensity on Earth's surface due to clouds are on the order of 25% in either direction while enhancement tends to occur above the clouds ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bais et al. 2006</ref>). Given the degree of supersaturation in our wetter runs, however, attenuation is more likely than enhancement below the clouds. This would decrease the H 2 O 2 and O 3 photolysis rates and cause an increase in the number densities of these species, which in turn would decrease the efficiency of S2 and R5</p><p>while increasing the efficiency of S3. The magnitude to which these pathways change will depend on how much UV is attenuated as a function of wavelength, as well as the variability time scale of the clouds -if this time scale is sufficiently short, it may be irrelevant for the long time scales considered here.</p><p>The existence of water ice clouds may also result in heterogeneous chemistry that impacts the stability of CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Atreya &amp; Blamont 1990)</ref>. For example, observations of high O 3 mixing ratios over the northern polar region of Mars during northern spring is likely due to the uptake of HO x radicals by cloud particles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lefèvre et al. 2008</ref>). If similar processes occurred in our model atmosphere, then the decrease in HO x species would reduce the efficiency of S2 and S3, while the buildup in O 3 would increase the efficiency of S3 and R5. As S2 is responsible for the highest rate of CO 2 regeneration, inclusion of heterogeneous chemistry will likely result in reduced amounts of CO 2 , even when the atmospheric hydrogen content is relatively high. This is consistent with simulations of the Martian atmosphere that included heterogeneous chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atreya &amp; Gu 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lefèvre et al. 2008</ref>). The magnitude of these effects will depend on the reactive surface area of the cloud particles and the amount of condensable water vapor in the atmosphere.</p><p>In drier cases, the lack of significant cloud formation and rainout may produce a substantial silicate dust layer, as in the near-surface atmosphere of Mars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hamilton et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>These particles may also participate in heterogeneous chemistry and UV attenuation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Atreya &amp; Gu 1994)</ref>, though the magnitude of the effect is likely less than that of water ice particles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nair et al. 1994</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have investigated the stability of H 2 O-depleted, CO 2 -dominated atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting near the outer edge of the habitable zones of M dwarfs. These atmospheres may be common due to the desiccation and oxidation of the outer layers of these planets during the host stars' pre-main sequence, when it is much more luminous than later in its evolution. We found that these atmospheres are stabilized against photolytic conversion to CO abundances. This would lead to much greater losses of CO 2 and ultimately the formation of a CO atmosphere.</p><p>The sensitivity of these results to temperature changes and clouds is highly complex and nonlinear, owing to the unknowns in UV-cloud radiative transfer, heterogeneous chemistry, and the feedback between temperature and reaction rates. A coupled photochemical and radiative transfer model may be necessary to fully elucidate the evolution of these exotic atmospheres.

concentrations decrease and the H 2 O 2 cycle (S2) breaks down, resulting in decreasing CO 2 and 

increasing O 2 and CO. The rise in O 2 leads to higher O 3 mixing ratios, which can now participate 

in the CO 2 regeneration process. Due to the low HO 2 concentrations, the O 3 cycle (S3) can only 

maintain half of the CO 2 in the original atmosphere. If the atmospheric hydrogen content is &lt;0.1 

ppm, any reactions involving H-species such as H or HO 2 become irrelevant, and the spin-

forbidden recombination reaction R5 dominates. This reaction is actually more effective than S3, 

as O 3 (the source of O) increases in abundance as H decreases, and thus only 40% of the 

atmospheric CO 2 is converted to CO and O 2 . These values may be subject to change given 

different atmospheric temperatures or surface pressures, but these catalytic cycles and reactions 

are likely general due to their self-limiting nature, i.e. if one catalytic cycle is inefficient, then 

another will take over. 

Our model produces abundances of abiotic O 2 and O 3 comparable to that produced by 

photosynthetic organisms on modern Earth. This is due to our assumption of a low-H 2 O 

atmosphere and dry surface, which decreases the CO 2 regeneration rate and the surface 

deposition rate of oxidizing species. These conditions may be applicable to terrestrial exoplanets 

in the habitable zones of M dwarfs (Luger &amp; Barnes 2015). The high mixing ratios of O 2 and O 3 

can potentially pose as false positives in the search for biosignatures, but a simultaneous search 

for water vapor could potentially differentiate between an actual Earth-like planet with 

biologically mediated atmospheric disequilibrium from a water-depleted planet with atmospheric disequilibrium caused by </table></figure>
