			<abstract>
				<p>Age determination is undertaken for nearby early-type (BAF) stars, which constitute attractive targets for high-contrast debris disk and planet imaging surveys. Our analysis sequence consists of: acquisition of uvbyβ photometry from catalogs, correction for the effects of extinction, interpolation of the photometry onto model atmosphere grids from which atmospheric parameters are determined, and finally, comparison to the theoretical isochrones from pre-main sequence through post-main sequence stellar evolution models, accounting for the effects of stellar rotation. We calibrate and validate our methods at the atmospheric parameter stage by comparing our results to fundamentally determined T eff and log g values. We validate and test our methods at the evolutionary model stage by comparing our results on ages to the accepted ages of several benchmark open clusters (IC 2602, α Persei, Pleiades, Hyades). Finally, we apply our methods to estimate stellar ages for 3493 field stars, including several with directly imaged exoplanet candidates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In contrast to other fundamental stellar parameters such as mass, radius, and angular momentum -that for certain well-studied stars and stellar systems can be anchored firmly in observables and simple physics -stellar ages for stars other than the Sun have no firm basis. Ages are critical, however, for many investigations involving time scales including formation and evolution of planetary systems, evolution of debris disks, and interpretation of low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and so-called planetary mass objects that are now being detected routinely as faint point sources near bright stars in high contrast imaging surveys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The Era of Direct Imaging of Exoplanets</head><p>Intermediate-mass stars (1.5 − 3.0 M ) have proven themselves attractive targets for planet search work. Hints of their importance first arose during initial data return from IRAS in the early 1980s, when several Atype stars (notably Vega but also β Pic and Fomalhaut) as well K-star Eps Eri -collectively known as "the fab four" -distinguished themselves by showing mid-infrared excess emission due to optically thin dust in KuiperBelt-like locations. Debris disks are signposts of planets, which dynamically stir small bodies resulting in dust production. Spitzer results in the late 2000s solidified the spectral type dependence of debris disk presence (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Carpenter et al. 2006</ref>; Wyatt 2008) for stars of common age. For a random sample of field stars, however, the primary variable determining the likelihood of debris is stellar age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kains et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>The correlation in radial velocity studies of giant planet frequency with stellar mass <ref type="bibr">Gai- dos et al. 2013</ref>) is another line of evidence connecting <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>

The claim is that while ∼14% of A stars have one or more &gt; 1M Jupiter companions at &lt;5 AU, only ∼2% of M stars do ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Johnson et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, c.f. Lloyd 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Schlaufman &amp; Winn 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Consistently interpreted as indicators of hidden planets, debris disks finally had their long-awaited observational connection to planets with the watershed discovery of directly imaged planetary mass companions. These were -like the debris disks before them -found first around intermediate-mass A-type stars, rather than the solar-mass FGK-type stars that had been the subject of much observational work at high contrast during the 2000s. HR 8799 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Marois et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marois et al. , 2010</ref>) followed by Fomalhaut ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Kalas et al. 2008</ref>) and β Pic ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lagrange et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">Lagrange et al. , 2010</ref> have had their planets and indeed one planetary system, digitally captured by ground-based and/or space-based high contrast imaging techniques. Of the known bona fide planetary mass (&lt; 10M Jup ) companions that have been directly imaged, six of the nine are located around the three A-type host stars mentioned above, with the others associated with lower mass stars including the even younger 5-10 Myr old star <ref type="bibr">1RXS 1609</ref><ref type="bibr">- 2105</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ireland et al. 2011</ref>) and brown dwarf 2MASS 1207-3933 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chauvin et al. 2004</ref>) and the probably older GJ 504 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kuzuhara et al. 2013</ref>). Note that to date these directly imaged objects are all "super-giant planets" and not solar system giant planet analogs (e.g. Jupiter mass or below).</p><p>Based on the early results, the major direct imaging planet searches have attempted to optimize success by preferentially observing intermediate-mass, early-type stars. The highest masses are avoided due to the limits of contrast. Recent campaigns include those with all the major large aperture telescopes: Keck/NIRC2, VLT/NACO, Gemini/NICI, and Subaru/HiCAO. Current and near-future campaigns include Project 1640 (P1640; <ref type="bibr">Hinkley et al. 2011</ref>) at Palomar Observatory, Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), operating on the Gemini South telescope, VLT/SPHERE, and Subaru/CHARIS. The next-generation TMT and E-ELT telescopes both feature high contrast instruments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Mawet et al. (2012)</ref> compares instrumental contrast curves in their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Despite the technological developments over the past decade, given the as-built contrast realities, only the largest, hottest, brightest, and therefore the youngest planets, i.e. those less than a few to a few hundred Myr in age, are still self-luminous enough to be amenable to direct imaging detection. Moving from the 3-10 M Jupiter detections at several tens of AU that are possible today/soon, to detection of lower mass, more Earth-like planets located at smaller, more terrestrial zone, separations, will require pushing to higher contrast from future space-based platforms. The targets of future surveys, whether ground or space, are however not likely to be substantially different from the samples targeted in today's ground-based surveys.</p><p>The most important parameter really is age, since the brightness of planets decreases so sharply with increasing age due to the rapid gravitational contraction and cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Fortney et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Burrows et al. 2004</ref>). There is thus a premium on identifying the closest, youngest stars.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The Age Challenge</head><p>Unlike the other fundamental parameters of stellar mass (unambiguously determined from measurements of double-line eclipsing binaries and application of Kepler's laws) and stellar radius (unambiguously measured from interferometric measurements of angular diameters and parallax measurements of distances), there are no directly interpretable observations leading to stellar age. Solar-type stars (∼ 0.7−1.4M , spectral types F6-K5) were the early targets of radial velocity planet searches and later debris disk searches that can imply the presence of planets. For these objects, although more work remains to be done, there are established activity-rotationage diagnostics that are driven by the presence of convective outer layers and can serve as proxies for stellar age (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand 2008)</ref>.</p><p>For stars significantly different from our Sun, however, and in particular the intermediate-mass stars (∼ 1.5 − 3.0M , spectral types A0-F5 near the main sequence) of interest here, empirical age-dating techniques have not been sufficiently established or calibrated. Ages have been investigated recently for specific samples of several tens of stars using color-magnitude diagrams by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Nielsen et al. (2013)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Vigan et al. (2012)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Moór et al. (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Su et al. (2006)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Rhee et al. (2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Lowrance et al. (2000)</ref>.</p><p>Perhaps the most robust ages for young BAF stars come from clusters and moving groups, which contain not only the early-type stars of interest, but also lower mass stars to which the techniques mentioned above can be applied. These groups are typically dated using a combination of stellar kinematics, lithium abundances, rotation-activity indicators, and placement along theoretical isochrones in a color-magnitude diagram. The statistics of these coeval stellar populations greatly reduce the uncertainty in derived ages. However, only four such groups exist within ∼ 60 pc of the Sun and the number of early-type members is small.</p><p>Field BAF stars having late-type companions at wide separation could have ages estimated using the methods valid for F6-K5 age dating. However, these systems are not only rare in the solar neighborhood, but considerable effort is required in establishing companionship e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Stauffer et al. (1995)</ref>; Barrado y <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Navascues et al. (1997)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Song et al. (2000)</ref>. Attempts to derive fractional main sequence ages for A-stars based on the evolution of rotational velocities are ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Zorec &amp; Royer 2012)</ref>, but this method is undeveloped and a bimodal distribution in v sin i for early-type A-stars may inhibit its utility. Another method, asteroseismology, which detects loworder oscillations in stellar interiors to determine the central density and hence age, is a heavily model-dependent method, observationally expensive, and best suited for older stars with denser cores.</p><p>The most general and quantitative way to age-date A0-F5 field stars is through isochrone placement. As intermediate-mass stars evolve quickly along the H-R diagram, they are better suited for age-dating via isochrone placement relative to their low-mass counterparts which remain nearly stationary on the main sequence for many <ref type="bibr">Gyr (Soderblom 2010)</ref>. Indeed, the mere presence of an early-type star on the main sequence suggests moderate youth, since the hydrogen burning phase is relatively short-lived. However, isochronal ages are obviously model-dependent and they do require precise placement of the stars on an H-R diagram implying a parallax. The major uncertainties arise from lack of information regarding metallicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Nielsen et al. 2013</ref>), rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Collins &amp; Smith 1985)</ref> and multiplicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(De Rosa et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Our Approach</head><p>Despite that many nearby BAF stars are well-studied, historically, there is no modern data set leading to a set of consistently derived stellar ages for this population of stars. Here we apply Strömgren photometric techniques, and by combining modern stellar atmospheres and modern stellar evolutionary codes, we develop the methods for robust age determination for stars more massive than the Sun. The technique uses specific filters, careful calibration, definition of photometric indices, correction for any reddening, interpolation from index plots of physical atmospheric parameters, correction for rotation, and finally Bayesian estimation of stellar ages from evolutionary models that predict the atmospheric parameters as a function of mass and age.</p><p>Specifically, our work uses high-precision archival uvbyβ photometry and model atmospheres so as to determine the fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters T eff and log g. Placing stars accurately in an log T eff vs. log g diagram leads to derivation of their ages and masses. We consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bressan et al. (2012)</ref> evolutionary models that include pre-main sequence evolutionary times (2 Myr at 3 M and 17 Myr at 1.5 M ), which are a significant fraction of any intermediate mass star's absolute age, as well as <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ekström et al. (2012)</ref> evolutionary models that self-consistently account for stellar rotation, which has non-negligible effects on the inferred stellar parameters of rapidly rotating early-type stars. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref> shows model predictions for the evolution of both physical and observational parameters.</p><p>The primary sample to which our technique is applied in this work consists of 3499 BAF field stars within 100 Evolution of log T eff and log g with age for intermediate-mass stars, as predicted by PARSEC evolutionary models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bressan et al. 2012</ref>).

While the color and temperature trends reflect one another, the absolute magnitude trends are not as strong as the surface gravity trends when the stars are evolving from the main sequence after a few hundred Myr. The PARSEC models predict the precision in log g needed to distinguish a 1.5M star and a 2.0M star evolves from 0.0397 dex at ∼ 30 Myr to 0.0242 dex at 100 Myr to 0.0378 dex at ∼ 300 Myr. The precision in log g needed to distinguish a 1.5M star and a 3.0M evolves from 0.0085 dex at ∼ 30 Myr to 0.0694 dex at 100 Myr to 0.5159 dex at ∼ 300 Myr. The precision in log g needed to distinguish a 2.0M star and a 3.0M evolves from 0.0312 dex at ∼ 30 Myr to 0.0936 dex at 100 Myr to 0.4781 dex at 300 Myr.</p><p>pc and with uvbyβ photometry available in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hauck &amp; Mermilliod (1998)</ref> catalog, hereafter HM98. The robustness of our method is tested at different stages with several control samples. To assess the uncertainties in our atmospheric parameters we consider (1) 69 T eff standard stars from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boyajian et al. (2013)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Napiwotzki et al. (1993)</ref>; (2) 39 double-lined eclipsing binaries with standard log g from <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Torres et al. (2010)</ref>; (3) 16 other stars from <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Napiwotzki et al. (1993)</ref>, also for examining log g. To examine isochrone systematics, stars in four open clusters are studied (31 members of IC 2602, 51 members of α Per, 47 members of the Pleiades, and 47 members of the Hyades). Some stars belonging to sample (1) above are also contained in the large primary sample of field stars.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Prieto &amp; Lambert (1999)</ref>. An advantage over more traditional color-magnitude diagram techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Nielsen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">De Rosa et al. 2014</ref>) is that distance knowledge is not required, so the distance-age degeneracy is removed. Also, metallicity effects are relatively minor (as addressed in an Appendix) and rotation effects are well-modelled and can be corrected for ( § 3.3). Overplotted on an arbitrary scale is the synthetic spectrum of an A0V star generated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Munari et al. (2005)</ref> from an ATLAS9 model atmosphere. The uvby filter profiles are those of Bessell (2011), while the Hβ filter profiles are those originally described in Crawford (1966) and the throughput curves are taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Description of the Photometric System</head><p>The uvbyβ photometric system is comprised of four intermediate-band filters (uvby) first advanced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Strömgren (1966)</ref> plus the Hβ narrow and wide filters developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Crawford (1958)</ref>; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Together, the two filter sets form a well-calibrated system that was specifically designed for studying earlier-type BAF stars, for which the hydrogen line strengths and continuum slopes in the Balmer region rapidly change with temperature and gravity.</p><p>From the fluxes contained in the six passbands, five uvbyβ indices are defined. The color indices, (b − y) and (u − b), and the β-index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">β = Hβ narrow − Hβ wide ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>are all sensitive to temperature and weakly dependent on surface gravity for late A-and F-type stars. The Balmer discontinuity index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c 1 = (u − v) − (v − b),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>is sensitive to temperature for early type (OB) stars and surface gravity for intermediate (AF) spectral types. Finally, the metal line index,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m 1 = (v − b) − (b − y),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>is sensitive to the metallicity [M/H]. For each index, there is a corresponding intrinsic, dereddened index denoted by a naught subscript with e.g c 0 , (b − y) 0 , and (u − b) 0 , referring to the intrinsic, dereddened equivalents of the indices c 1 , (b−y), and (u−b), respectively. Furthermore, although reddening is expected to be negligible for the nearby sources of primary interest to us, automated classification schemes that divide a large sample of stars for analysis into groups corresponding to earlier than, around, and later than the Balmer maximum will sometimes rely on the reddeningindependent indices defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Crawford &amp; Mandwewala (1976)</ref> for A-type dwarfs:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[c 1 ] = c 1 − 0.19(b − y) (4) [m 1 ] = m 1 + 0.34(b − y) (5) [u − b] = [c 1 ] + 2[m 1 ].<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Finally, two additional indices useful for early A-type stars, a 0 and r * , are defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">a 0 = 1.36(b − y) 0 + 0.36m 0 + 0.18c 0 − 0.2448 (7) = (b − y) 0 + 0.18[(u − b) 0 − 1.36], (8) r * = 0.35c 1 − 0.07(b − y) − (β − 2.565).<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Note that r * is a reddening free parameter, and thus indifferent to the use of reddened or unreddened photometric indices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Extinction Correction</head><p>Though the sample of nearby stars to which we applying the Strömgren methodology are assumed to be unextincted or only lightly extincted, interstellar reddening is significant for the more distant stars including those in the open clusters used in § 6 to test the accuracy of the ages derived using our uvbyβ methodology. In the cases where extinction is thought to be significant, corrections are performed using the UVBYBETA 2 and DEREDD 3 programs for IDL.</p><p>These IDL routines take as input (b − y), m 1 , c 1 , β, and a class value (between 1-8) that is used to roughly identify what region of the H-R diagram an individual star resides in. For our sample, stars belong to only four of the eight possible classes. These classes are summarized as follows: (1) B0-A0, III-V, 2.59 &lt; β &lt; 2.88, −0.20 &lt; c 0 &lt; 1.00, (5) A0-A3, III-V, 2.87 &lt; β &lt; 2.93, −0.01 &lt; (b − y) 0 &lt; 0.06, (6) A3-F0, III-V, 2.72 &lt; β &lt; 2.88, 0.05 &lt; (b − y) 0 &lt; 0.22, and (7) F1-G2, III-V, 2.60 &lt; β &lt; 2.72, 0.22 &lt; (b − y) 0 &lt; 0.39. The class values in this work were assigned to individual stars based on their known spectral types (provided in the XHIP catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson &amp; Francis 2011))</ref>, and β values where needed. In some instances, A0-A3 stars assigned to class (5) with values of β &lt; 2.87, the dereddening procedure was unable to proceed. For these cases, stars were either assigned to class (1) if they were spectral type A0-A1, or to class (6), if they were spectral type A2-A3.</p><p>Depending on the class of an individual star, the program then calculates the dereddened indices (b − y) 0 , m 0 , c 0 , the color excess E(b−y), δm 0 , the absolute V magnitude, M V , the stellar radius and effective temperature. Notably, the β index is unaffected by reddening as it is the flux difference between two narrow band filters with essentially the same central wavelength. Thus, no corrections are performed on β and this index can be used robustly in coarse classification schemes.</p><p>To transform E(b − y) to A V , we use the extinction measurements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref> and to propagate the effects of reddening through to the various uvbyβ indices we use the calibrations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Crawford &amp; Mandwewala (1976)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E(m 1 ) = −0.33E(b − y) (10) E(c 1 ) = 0.20E(b − y) (11) E(u − b) = 1.54E(b − y).<label>(12)</label></formula><p>From these relations, given the intrinsic color index (b − y) 0 , the reddening free parameters m 0 , c 0 , (u − b) 0 , and a 0 can be computed.</p><p>In § 4.3 we quantify the effects of extinction and extinction uncertainty on the final atmospheric parameter estimation, T eff , log g.</p></div>

See e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Figueras et al. (1991)</ref> for further description.</p><p>Numerous calibrations, both theoretical and empirical, of the uvbyβ photometric system exist. For this work we use the <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, 2004</ref>) color grids generated from solar metallicity (Z=0.017, in this case) ATLAS9 model atmospheres using a microturbulent velocity parameter of ξ = 0 km s −1 and the new ODF. We do not use the alpha-enhanced color grids. The grids are readily available from F. Castelli 4 or R. Kurucz 5 .</p><p>Prior to assigning atmospheric parameters to our program stars directly from the model grids, we first investigated the accuracy of the models on samples of BAF stars with fundamentally determined T eff (through interferometric measurements of the angular diameter and estimations of the total integrated flux) and log g (from measurements of the masses and radii of double lined eclipsing binaries). We describe these validation procedures in § 4.1 and § 4.2.</p><p>Atmospheric parameter determination occurs in three different observational Strömgren planes depending on the temperature regime (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>; this is in order to avoid the degeneracies that are present in all single observational planes when mapped onto the physical parameter space of log T eff and log g.</p><p>Building off of the original work of e.g. Strömgren <ref type="bibr">(1951,</ref><ref type="bibr">1966)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Moon &amp; Dworetsky (1985)</ref>, and later <ref type="bibr">Napi- wotzki et al. (1993)</ref>, suggested assigning physical parameters in the following three regimes: for cool stars (T eff ≤ 8500 K), β or (b−y) can be used as a temperature indicator and c 0 is a surface gravity indicator; for intermediate temperature stars (8500 K ≤ T eff ≤ 11000 K), the temperature indicator is a 0 and surface gravity indicator r * ; finally, for hot stars (T eff 11000 K), the c 0 or the [u−b] indices can be used as a temperature indicator while β is a gravity indicator (note that the role of β is reversed for hot stars compared to its role for cool stars). We adopt here c 1 vs. β for the hottest stars, a 0 vs. r * for the intermediate temperatures, and (b − y) vs. c 1 for the cooler stars.</p><p>Choosing the appropriate plane for parameter determination effectively means establishing a crude temperature sequence prior to fine parameter determination; in this, the β index is critical. Because the β index switches from being a temperature indicator to a gravity indicator in the temperature range of interest to us (spectral type B0-F5, luminosity class IV/V stars), atmospheric parameter determination proceeds depending on the temperature regime. For the T eff and log g calibrations described below, temperature information existed for all of the calibration stars, though this is not the case for our program stars. In the general case we must rely on photometric classification to assign stars to the late, intermediate, and early groups, and then proceed to determine atmospheric parameters in the relevant uvbyβ planes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Moon (1985)</ref> provides a scheme, present in the UVBYBETA IDL routine, for roughly identifying the region of the H-R diagram in which a star resides. However, because our primary sample of field stars are assumed to be unextincted, and because the UVBYBETA program relies on user-inputted class values based on unverified spectral types from the literature, we opt for a classification scheme based solely on the uvbyβ photometry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Monguió et al. (2014)</ref>, hereafter M14, designed a sophisticated classification scheme, based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Strömgren (1966)</ref>. The M14 scheme places stars into early (B0-A0), intermediate (A0-A3), and late (later than A3) groups based solely on β, the reddened color (b − y), and the reddening-free parameters <ref type="bibr">[c 1</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_6">], [m 1 ], [u − b]</formula><p>. The M14 scheme improves upon the previous method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Figueras et al. (1991)</ref> by imposing two new conditions (see their <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> for the complete scheme) intended to prevent the erroneous classification of some stars. For our sample of 3499 field stars (see § 7), there are 699 stars lacking β photometry, all but three of which cannot be classified by the M14 scheme. For such cases, we rely on supplementary spectral type information and manually assign these unclassified stars to the late group. Using the M14 scheme, the final makeup of our field star sample is 85.9% late, 8.4% intermediate, and 5.7% early.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Sample and Numerical Methods</head><p>For all stars in this work, uvbyβ photometry is acquired from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hauck &amp; Mermilliod (1998)</ref> compilation (hereafter HM98), unless otherwise noted. HM98 provides the most extensive compilation of uvbyβ photometric measurements, taken from the literature and complete to the end of 1996 (the photometric system has seen less frequent usage/publication in more modern times). The HM98 compilation includes 105,873 individual photometric measurements for 63,313 different stars, culled from 533 distinct sources, and are presented both as individual measurements and weighted means of the literature values.</p><p>The HM98 catalog provides (b − y), m 1 , c 1 , and β and the associated errors in each parameter if available. From these indices a 0 and r * are computed according to Equations (7), (8) &amp; (9). The ATLAS9 uvbyβ grids provide a means of translating from (b − y, m 1 , c 1 , β, a 0 , r * ) to a precise combination of (T eff , log g). Interpolation within the model grids is performed on the appropriate grid: ((b − y) vs. c 1 for the late group, a 0 vs. r * for the intermediate group, and c 1 vs. β for the early group).</p><p>The interpolation is linear and performed using the SciPy routine griddata. Importantly, the model log g values are first converted into linear space so that g is determined from the linear interpolation procedure before being brought back into log space. The model grids used in this work are spaced by 250 K in T eff and 0.5 dex in log g. To improve the precision of our method of atmospheric parameter determination in the future, it would be favorable to use model color grids that have been calculated at finer resolutions, particularly in log g, directly from model atmospheres. However, the grid spacings stated above are fairly standardized among extant uvbyβ grids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Rotational Velocity Correction</head><p>Early-type stars are rapid rotators, with rotational velocities of v sin i 150 km s −1 being typical. For a rotating star, both surface gravity and effective temperature decrease from the poles to the equator, changing the mean gravity and temperature of a rapid rotator relative to a slower rotator <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Sweet &amp; Roy 1953)</ref>. Vega, rotating with an inferred equatorial velocity of v eq ∼ 270 km s −1 at a nearly pole-on inclination, has measured poleto-equator gradients in T eff and log g that are ∼ 2400 K and ∼ 0.5 dex, respectively ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Peterson et al. 2006</ref>). The apparent luminosity change due to rotation depends on the inclination: a pole-on (i = 0 • ) rapid rotator appears more luminous than a nonrotating star of the same mass, while an edge-on (i = 90 • ) rapid rotator appears less luminous than a nonrotating star of the same mass. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Sweet &amp; Roy (1953)</ref> found that a (v sin i) 2 correction factor could describe the changes in luminosity, gravity, and temperature.</p><p>The net effect of stellar rotation on inferred age is to make a rapid rotator appear cooler, more luminous, and hence older when compared to a nonrotating star of the same mass (or more massive when compared to a nonrotating star of the same age). Optical colors can be affected since the spectral lines of early type stars are strong and broad. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kraft &amp; Wrubel (1965)</ref> demonstrated specifically in the Strömgren system that the effects are predominantly in the gravity indicators (c 1 , which then also affects the other gravity indicator r * ) and less so in the temperature indicators (b − y, which then affects a 0 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Figueras &amp; Blasi (1998)</ref>, hereafter FB98, used MonteCarlo simulations to investigate the effect of rapid rotation on the measured uvbyβ indices, derived atmospheric parameters, and hence isochronal ages of earlytype stars. Those authors concluded that stellar rotation conspires to artificially enhance isochronal ages derived through uvbyβ photometric methods by 30-50% on average.</p><p>To mitigate the effect of stellar rotation on the parameters T eff and log(g), FB98 presented the following corrective formulae for stars with T eff &gt; 11000 K:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆T eff = 0.0167(v sin i) 2 + 218,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>∆ log g = 2.10 × 10 −6 (v sin i) 2 + 0.034.</p><p>For stars with 8500K ≤ T eff ≤ 11000K, the analogous formulae are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆T eff = 0.0187(v sin i) 2 + 150,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>∆ log g = 2.92 × 10 −6 (v sin i) 2 + 0.048.</p><p>In both cases, ∆T eff and ∆ log g are added to the T eff and log g values derived from uvbyβ photometry.</p><p>Notably, the rotational velocity correction is dependent on whether the star belongs to the early, intermediate, or late group. Specifically, FB98 define three regimes: T eff &lt;8830 K (no correction), 8830 K&lt;Teff&lt;9700 K (correction for intermediate A0-A3 stars), Teff&gt;9700 K (correction for stars earlier than A3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Song et al. (2001)</ref>, who performed a similar isochronal age analysis of A-type stars using uvbyβ photometry, extended the FB98 rotation corrections to stars earlier and later than B7 and A4, respectively. In the present work, a more conservative approach is taken and the rotation correction is applied only to stars in the early or intermediate groups, as determined by the classification scheme discussed in § 3.1. This decision was partly justified by the abundance of late-type stars that fall below the ZAMS in the open cluster tests ( § 6), for which the rotation correction would have a small (due to the lower rotational velocities of late-type stars) but exacerbating effect on these stars whose surface gravities are already thought to be overestimated.</p><p>We include these corrections and, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig- ure 4</ref>, emphasize that in their absence we would err on the side of over-estimating the age of a star, meaning conservatively overestimating rather than underestimating companion masses based on assumed ages. As an example, for a star with T eff ≈ 13,275 K and logg ≈ 4.1, assumed to be rotating edge-on at 300 km s −1 , neglecting to apply the rotation correction would result in an age of ∼ 100 Myr. Applying the rotation correction to this star results in an age of ∼ 10 Myr.</p><p>Of note, the FB98 corrections were derived for atmospheric parameters determined using the synthetic uvbyβ color grids of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Moon &amp; Dworetsky (1985)</ref>. It is estimated that any differences in derived atmospheric parameters resulting from the use of color grids other than those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Moon &amp; Dworetsky (1985)</ref> are less than the typical measurement errors in those parameters. In § 4.3 we quantify the effects of rotation and rotation correction uncertainty on the final atmospheric parameter estimation, T eff , log g.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Effective Temperature</head><p>A fundamental determination of T eff is possible through an interferometric measurement of the stellar angular diameter and an estimate of the total integrated flux. We gathered 69 stars (listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) with fundamental T eff measurements from the literature and determine photometric temperatures for these objects from interpolation of uvbyβ photometry in ATLAS9 model grids.</p><p>Fundamental T eff values were sourced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Boyajian et al. (2013)</ref>, hereafter B13, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Napiwotzki et al. (1993)</ref>, hereafter N93. Several stars have multiple interferometric measurements of the stellar radius, and hence multiple fundamental T eff determinations. For these stars, identified as those objects with multiple radius references in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the mean T eff and standard deviation were taken as the fundamental measurement and standard error. Among the 16 stars with multiple fundamental T eff determinations by between 2 and 5 authors, there is a scatter of typically several percent (with 0.1-4% range).</p><p>Additional characteristics of the T eff "standard" stars are summarized as follows: spectral types B0-F9, luminosity classes III-V, 2 km s −1 ≤ v sin i ≤ 316 km s −1 , mean and median v sin i of 58 and 26 km s −1 , respectively, 2.6 pc ≤ d ≤ 493 pc, and a mean and median <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> of -0.08 and -0.06 dex, respectively. Line-of-sight rotational velocities were acquired from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski (2005)</ref> compilation and [Fe/H] values were taken from SIMBAD. Variability and multiplicity were considered, and our sample is believed to be free of any possible contamination due to either of these effects.</p><p>From the HM98 compilation we retrieved uvbyβ photometry for these "effective temperature standards." The effect of reddening was considered for the hotter, statistically more distant stars in the N93 sample. Comparing mean uvbyβ photometry from HM98 with the dereddened photometry presented in N93 revealed that nearly all of these stars have negligible reddening (E(b − y) ≤ 0.001 mag). The exceptions are HD 82328, HD 97603, HD 102870, and HD 126660 with color excesses of E(b − y) = 0.010, 0.003, 0.011, and 0.022 mag, respectively. Inspection of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> indicates that despite the use of the reddened HM98 photometry the T eff determinations for three of these four stars are still of high accuracy. For HD 97603, there is a discrepancy of &gt; 300 K between the fundamental and photometric temperatures. However, the uvbyβ T eff using reddened photometry for this star is actually hotter than the fundamental T eff . Notably, the author-to-author dispersion in multiple fundamental T eff determinations for HD 97603 is also rather large. As such, the HM98 photometry was deemed suitable for all of the "effective temperature standards."</p><p>For the sake of completeness, different model color grids were investigated, including those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Fitzpatrick &amp; Massa (2005)</ref>, which were recently calibrated for early group stars, and those of¨Onehagof¨ of¨Onehag et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2009)</ref>, which were calibrated from MARCS model atmospheres for stars cooler than 7000 K. We found the grids that best matched the fundamental effective temperatures were the ATLAS9 grids of solar metallicity with no alphaenhancement, microturbulent velocity of 0 km s −1 , and using the new opacity distribution function (ODF). The ATLAS9 grids with microturbulent velocity of 2 km s −1 were also tested, but were found to worsen both the fractional T eff error and scatter, though only nominally (by a few tenths of a percent).</p><p>For the early group stars, temperature determinations were attempted in both the however, were only ≈ 1.9% cooler than the fundamental values, regardless of whether c 1 or the dereddened index c 0 was used. This is not surprising as the c 1 − β plane is not particularly susceptible to reddening.</p><p>At intermediate temperatures, the a 0 −r * plane is used. In this regime, the ATLAS9 grids were found to overestimate T eff by ≈ 2.0% relative to the fundamental values.</p><p>Finally, for the late group stars temperature determinations were attempted in the (b − y) − c 1 and β − c 1 planes. In this regime, (b − y) was found to be a superior temperature indicator, improving the mean fractional error marginally and reducing the RMS scatter by more than 1%. In this group, the model grids overpredict T eff by ≈ 2.4% on average, regardless of whether the reddened or dereddened indices are used. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows a comparison of the temperatures derived from the ATLAS9 uvbyβ color grids and the fundamental effective temperatures given in B13 and N93. For the majority of stars the color grids can predict the effective temperature to within about 5 %. A slight systematic trend is noted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, such that the model color grids overpredict T eff at low temperatures and underpredict T eff at high temperatures. We attempt to correct for this systematic effect by applying T eff offsets in three regimes according to the mean behavior of each group: late and intermediate group stars were shifted to cooler temperatures by 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively, and early group stars were shifted by 1.9% toward hotter temperatures. After offsets were applied, the remaining RMS error in temperature determinations for these "standard" stars was 3.3%, 2.5%, and 3.5% for the late, intermediate, and early groups, respectively, or 3.1% overall.</p><p>Taking the uncertainties or dispersions in the fundamental T eff determinations as the standard error, there is typically a 5-6 σ discrepancy between the fundamental and photometric T eff determinations. However, given the large author-to-author dispersion observed for stars with multiple fundamental T eff determinations, it is likely that the formal errors on these measurements are underestimated. Notably, N93 does not publish errors for the fundamental T eff values, which are literature means. However, those authors did find fractional errors in their photometric T eff ranging from 2.5-4% for BA stars.</p><p>In § 6, we opted not to apply systematic offsets, instead assigning T eff uncertainties in three regimes according to the average fractional uncertainties noted in each group. In our final T eff determinations for our field star sample ( § 7) we attempted to correct for the slight temperature systematics and applied offsets, using the magnitude of the remaining RMS error (for all groups considered collectively) as the dominant source of uncertainty in our T eff measurement (see § 4.3).</p><p>As demonstrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, rotational effects on our temperature determinations for the T eff standards were investigated. Notably, the FB98 v sin i corrections appear to enhance the discrepancy between our temperature determinations and the fundamental temperatures for the late and intermediate groups, while moderately improving the accuracy for the early group. For the late group this is expected, as the correction formulae were originally derived for intermediate and early group stars. Notably, however, only two stars in the calibration sample exhibit projected rotational velocities &gt; 200 km s −1 . We examine the utility of the v sin i correction further in</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">§ 4.2 &amp; § 6.</formula><p>The effect of metallicity on the determination of T eff from the uvbyβ grids is investigated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> showing the ratio of the grid-determined temperature to the fundamental temperature as a function of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>.

The spectral type range for these systems is O8-F2, with luminosity classes of IV, V. The mass ratio (primary/secondary) for these systems ranges from ≈ 1.00-1.79, and the orbital periods of the primaries range from ≈ 1.57-8.44 days. In the cases of low mass ratios, the primary and secondary components should have nearly identical fundamental parameters, assuming they are coeval. In the cases of high mass ratios, given that the individual components are presumably unresolved, we assume that the primary dominates the uvbyβ photometry. For both cases (of low and high mass ratios), we assume that the photometry allows for accurate surface gravity determinations for the primary components and so we only consider the primaries from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Torres et al. (2010)</ref> sample.</p><p>It is important to note that the eclipsing binary systems used for the surface gravity calibration are more distant than the stars for which we can interferometrically determine angular diameters and effective temperatures for. Thus, for the surface gravity calibration it was necessary to compute the dereddened indices (b − y) 0 , m 0 , c 0 in order to obtain the highest accuracy possible for the intermediate-group stars, which rely on a 0 (an index using dereddened colors) as a temperature indicator. Notably, however, we found that the dereddened photometry actually worsened log g determinations for the early and late groups. Dereddened colors were computed using the IDL routine UVBYBETA.</p><p>The results of the log g calibration are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>. As described above, for the late group stars. (T eff &lt;8500 K), log g is determined in the (b−y)−c 1 plane. The mean and median of the log g residuals (in the sense of grid-fundamental) are -0.001 dex and -0.038 dex, respectively, and the RMS error 0.145 dex. As in § 4.1, we found that the β − c 1 plane produced less accurate atmospheric parameters, relative to fundamental determinations, for late group stars.</p><p>For the intermediate group stars (8500 K ≤ T eff ≤ 11000 K), log g is determined in the a 0 − r * plane. The mean and median of the log g residuals are -0.060 dex and -0.069 dex, respectively with RMS error 0.091 dex. For the early group stars (T eff &gt; 11000 K), log g is determined in the c 1 − β plane. The mean and median of the log g residuals are -0.0215 dex and 0.024 dex, respectively, with RMS error 0.113 dex. The [u − b] − β plane was also investigated for early group stars, but was found to produce log g values of lower accuracy relative to the fundamental determinations.</p><p>When considered collectively, the mean and median of the log g residuals for all stars are -0.017 dex and -0.034 dex, and the RMS error 0.127 dex. The uncertainties in our surface gravities that arise from propagating the photometric errors through our atmospheric parameter determination routines are of the order ∼ 0.02 dex, significantly lower than the uncertainties demonstrated by the comparison to fundamental values of log g.</p><p>As stated above, the main concern with using doublelined eclipsing binaries as surface gravity calibrators for our photometric technique is contamination from the unresolved secondary components. The log g residuals were examined as a function of both mass ratio and orbital period. While the amplitude of the scatter is marginally larger for low mass ratio or short period systems, in all cases our log g determinations are within 0.2 dex of the fundamental values ≈ 85% of the time.</p><p>To assess any potential systematic inaccuracies of the grids themselves, the surface gravity residuals were examined as a function of T eff and the grid-determined log g. <ref type="figure">Figures 9</ref> show the log g residuals as a function of T eff and log g, respectively. No considerable systematic effects as a function of either effective temperature or log g were found in the uvbyβ determinations of log g.</p><p>The effect of rotational velocity on our log g determinations was considered. As before, v sin i data for the surface gravity calibrators was collected from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski (2005)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, the majority of the log g calibrators are somewhat slowly rotating (v sin i ≤ 150 km s −1 ). While the v sin i correction increases the accuracy of our log g determinations for the early-group stars in most cases, the correction appears to worsen our determinations for the intermediate group, which appear systematically high to begin with.</p><p>The potential systematic effect of metallicity on our log g determinations is considered in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, showing the surface gravity residuals as a function of <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>.

There is a larger scatter in log g determinations for the more metalrich, late-type stars, however it is not clear that this effect is strictly due to metallicity.</p><p>In summary, for the open cluster tests we assign log g uncertainties in three regimes: ± 0.145 dex for stars belonging to the late group, ± 0.091 dex for the intermediate group, and ± 0.113 dex for the early group.</p><p>For our sample of nearby field stars we opt to assign a uniform systematic uncertainty of ± 0.116 dex for all stars. We do not attempt to correct for any systematic effects by applying offsets in log g, as we did with T eff .

For the early group stars, the atmospheric parameters were determined in both the c 0 − β plane and the [u − b] − β plane. In both cases, β is the gravity indicator, but we found that the log g values calculated when using c 0 as a temperature indicator for hot stars better matched the semi-fundamental spectroscopic log g values. This result is consistent with the result from the effective temperature calibration that suggests c 0 better predicted the effective temperatures of hot stars than <ref type="bibr">[u − b]</ref>.

There is no evidence for a significant systematic offset in the residuals as a function of either the uvbyβ-determined T eff or log g. For the early group, the mean and median surface gravity residuals are -0.007 dex and 0.004 dex, respectively, with RMS 0.041 dex. For the intermediate group, the mean and median surface gravity residuals are -0.053 dex and -0.047 dex, respectively, with RMS 0.081 dex.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Summary of Atmospheric Parameter</head><p>Uncertainties Precise and accurate stellar ages are the ultimate goal of this work. The accuracy of our ages is determined by both the accuracy with which we can determine atmospheric parameters and any systematic uncertainties associated with the stellar evolutionary models and our assumptions in applying them. The precision, on the other hand, is determined almost entirely by the precision with which we determine atmospheric parameters and, because there are some practical limits to how well we may ever determine T eff and log g, the location of the star in the H-R diagram (e.g. stars closer to the main sequence will always have more imprecise ages using this method).</p><p>It is thus important to provide a detailed accounting of the uncertainties involved in our atmospheric parameter determinations, as the final uncertainties quoted in our ages will arise purely from the values of the σ T eff , σ log g used in our χ 2 calculations. Below we consider the contribution of the systematics already discussed, as well as the contributions from errors in interpolation, photometry, metallicity, extinction, rotational velocity, multiplicity, and spectral peculiarity.</p><p>Systematics: The dominant source of uncertainty in our atmospheric parameter determinations are the systematics quantified in § 4.1 and § 4.2. All systematic effects inherent to the uvbyβ method, and the particular model color grids chosen, which we will call σ sys , are embedded in the comparisons to the stars with fundamentally or semi-fundamentally determined parameters, summarized as approximately ∼ 3.1% in T eff and ∼ 0.116 log(g) uvby In each case the solid colored line represents the mean of the residuals, ∆ log g (in the sense of fundamental-uvbyβ). As can be seen, the mean offsets for the late and early groups is negligible. For the intermediate group, however, while only five stars were used for calibration, the uvbyβ log g values are about 0.13 dex lower than the fundamental values on average. log(g) uvby eclipsing binary spectroscopic <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-Surface gravity residuals, ∆ log g (in the sense of fundamental-uvbyβ), as a function of uvbyβ-determined log (T eff ) (left) and log g (right). Solid points represent eclipsing binary primaries from <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Torres et al. (2010)</ref> and open circles are stars with spectroscopic log g determinations in N93. Of the 39 eclipsing binaries, only six have residuals greater than 0.2 dex in magnitude. This implies that the uvbyβ grids determine log g to within 0.2 dex of fundamental values ∼ 85% of the time. Surface gravity residuals are largest for the cooler stars. Photometric surface gravity measurements are in better agreement with spectroscopic determinations than the eclipsing binary sample. There is no indication for a global systematic offset in uvbyβ-determined log g values as a function of either T eff or log g.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson &amp; Francis (2012)</ref>. While metallicities seem to exist for very few of the surface gravity calibrators used here, there does not appear to be a systematic trend in the residuals with <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>. There is a larger amount of scatter for the more metal-rich late-type stars, however the scatter is confined to a relatively small range in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> and it is not clear that this effect is due to metallicity effects. dex in log g. We also found that for stars with available [Fe/H] measurements, the accuracy with which we can determine atmospheric parameters using uvbyβ photometry does not vary systematically with metallicity, though we further address metallicity issues both below and in an Appendix.</p><p>Interpolation Precision: To estimate the errors in atmospheric parameters due to the numerical precision of the interpolation procedures employed here, we generated 1000 random points in each of the three relevant uvbyβ planes. For each point, we obtained ten independent T eff , log g determinations to test the repeatability of the interpolation routine.

Photometric Errors: Considering the most basic element of our approach, there are uncertainties due to the propagation of photometric errors through our atmospheric parameter determination pipeline. As discussed in § 7, the photometric errors are generally small (∼ 0.005 mag in a given index). Translating the model grid points in the rectangular regions defined by the magnitude of the mean photometric error in a given index, and then interpolating to find the associated atmospheric parameters of the perturbed point, we take the maximum and minimum values for T eff and log g to calculate the error due to photometric measurement error.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">T eff T uvby log g EB log g uvby v sin i [Fe/H] (b − y) m 1 c 1 β (K) (K) (dex) (dex) (km s −1 ) (dex)<label>(mag</label></formula><p>To simplify the propagation of photometric errors for individual stars, we performed simulations with randomly generated data to ascertain the mean uncertainty in T eff , log g that results from typical errors in each of the uvbyβ indices.</p><p>We begin with the HM98 photometry and associated measurement errors for our sample (3499 stars within 100 pc, B0-F5, luminosity classes IV-V). Since the HM98 compilation does not provide a 0 or r * , as these quantities are calculated from the four fundamental indices, we calculate the uncertainties in these parameters using the crude approximation that none of the uvbyβ indices are correlated. Under this assumption, the uncertainties associated with a 0 and r * are as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">σ a0 = 1.36 2 σ 2 b−y + 0.36 2 σ 2 m1 + 0.18 2 σ 2 c1<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">σ r * = 0.07 2 σ 2 b−y + 0.35 2 σ 2 c1 + σ 2 β .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>A model for the empirical probability distribution function (hereafter PDF) for the error in a given uvbyβ index is created through a normalized histogram with 25 bins.

The maximally discrepant (T eff , log g) values are saved and the overall distributions of ∆T eff /T eff and ∆ log g are then analyzed to assess the mean uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters derived in a given uvbyβ plane due to the propagation of typical photometric errors. For the late group, points were generated in the range of (b − y) − c 1 parameter space bounded by 6500 K ≤ T eff ≤ 9000 K and 3.0 ≤ log g ≤ 5.0. In this group, typical photometric uncertainties of σ b−y = 0.003 mag and σ c1 = 0.005 mag lead to average uncertainties of 0.6 % in T eff and 0.055 dex in log g. For the intermediate group, points were generated in the range of a 0 − r * parameter space bounded by 8500 K ≤ T eff ≤ 11000 K and 3.0 ≤ log g ≤ 5.0. In this group, typical photometric uncertainties of σ a0 = 0.005 mag and σ r * = 0.005 mag lead to average uncertainties of 0.8 % in T eff and 0.046 dex in log g. For the early group, points were generated in the range of c 1 − β parameter space bounded by 10000 K ≤ T eff ≤ 30000 K and 3.0 ≤ log g ≤ 5.0. In this group, typical photometric uncertainties of σ c1 = 0.005 mag and σ β = 0.004 mag lead to average uncertainties of 1.1 % in T eff and 0.078 dex in log g. Across all three groups, the mean uncertainty due to photometric errors is ≈ 0.9% in T eff and ≈ 0.060 dex in log g.</p><p>Metallicity Effects: For simplicity and homogeneity, our method assumes solar composition throughout. However, our sample can more accurately be represented as a Gaussian centered at -0.109 dex with σ ≈ 0.201 dex. Metallicity is a small, but non-negligible, effect and allowing [M/H] to change by ± 0.5 dex can lead to differences in the assumed T eff of ∼ 1-2% for late-, intermediate-, and some early-group stars, or differences of up to 6% for stars hotter than ∼ 17000 K (of which there are few in our sample). In log g, shifts of ±0.5 dex in [M/H] can lead to differences of ∼ 0.1 dex in the assumed log g for late-or early-group stars, or ∼ 0.05 dex in the narrow region occupied by intermediate-group stars.</p><p>Here, we estimate the uncertainty the metallicity approximation introduces to the fundamental stellar parameters derived in this work. We begin with the actual uvbyβ data for our sample, and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>  , we perform a linear interpolation to find the most accurate values of T eff , log g given the color grids available. We also store the atmospheric parameters a given star would be assigned assuming [M/H]=0.0. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the histograms of T eff /T eff,[M/H]=0 and log g − log g [M/H]=0 . We take the standard deviations in these distributions to reflect the typical error introduced by the solar metallicity approximation. For T eff , there is a 0.8% uncertainty introduced by the true dispersion of metallicities in our sample, and for log g, the uncertainty is 0.06 dex. These uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters are naturally propagated into uncertainties in the age and mass of a star through the likelihood calculations outlined in § 5.2.1.</p><p>Reddening Effects: For the program stars studied here, interstellar reddening is assumed negligible. Performing the reddening corrections (described in § 2.2) on our presumably unreddened sample of stars within 100 pc, we find for the ∼ 80% of stars for which dereddening proved possible, that the distribution of A V values in our sample is approximately Gaussian with a mean and standard deviation of µ = 0.007, σ = 0.125 mag, respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref>). Of course, negative A V values are unphysical, but applying the reddening corrections Fig. 12.-Distributions of the true variations in T eff (left) and log g (right) caused by our assumption of solar metallicity. The "true" T eff and log g values are determined for the ∼ 68% of our field star sample with [Fe/H] measurements in XHIP and from linear interpolation between the set of atmospheric parameters determined in eight ATLAS9 grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Castelli &amp; Kurucz 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, 2004</ref>) that vary from -2.5 to 0.5 dex in [M/H]. The shifts in uvbyβ space have been computed according to the extinction measurements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Schlegel et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Crawford &amp; Mandwewala (1976)</ref>, assuming A V 4.237E(b − y). The magnitudes of A V chosen for this figure represent the extremes of values expected for our sample of nearby stars and are meant to illustrate the directionality of the effects of reddening as propagated through the uvbyβ planes. Finally, note for the early group (black vectors), the A V values are an order of magnitude larger and much higher than expected for our sample. Again, this is to illustrate the directionality of the reddening effect, which is particularly small for the early group which rely on c 1 , the Balmer discontinuity index, for temperature, and β, a color between two narrow-band filters with nearly the same central wavelength, for log g.</p><p>to our uvbyβ photometry and deriving the atmospheric parameters for each star in both the corrected and uncorrected cases gives us an estimate of the uncertainties in those parameters due to our assumption of negligible reddening out to 100 pc. The resulting distributions of T eff,0 /T eff and log g 0 − log g, where the naught subscripts indicate the dereddened values, are sharply peaked at 1 and 0, respectively. The FWHM of these distributions indicate an uncertainty &lt; 0.2% in T eff and ∼ 0.004 dex in log g. For the general case of sources at larger distances that may suffer more significant reddening, the systematic effects of under-correcting for extinction are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>.</p><p>Uncertainties in Projected Rotational Velocities: The Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski (2005) compilation contains mean v sin i measurements, as well as individual measurements from multiple authors. Of the 3499 stars in our sub-sample of the HM98 catalog, 2547 stars have v sin i values based on 4893 individual v sin i measurements, 1849 of which have an accompanying measurement error. Of these measurements, 646 are for intermediate or early groups, for which rotation corrections are performed in our method. The mean fractional error in v sin i for this subset of measurements is ∼ 13%. Caclulating the atmospheric parameters for these stars, then performing the FB98 v sin i corrections using v rot and v rot ± σ vrot allows us to estimate the magnitude of the uncertainty in T eff , log g due to the uncertainties in v sin i measurements. The resulting RMS errors in T eff , log g are 0.7% and 0.01 dex, respectively. When v sin i measurements are not available, an average value based on the spectral type can be assumed, resulting in a somewhat larger error. The systematic effects of under-correcting for rotation are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Influence of Multiplicity: In a large study such as this one, a high fraction of stars are binaries or higher multiples. Slightly more than 30% of our sample stars are known as members of multiple systems. We choose not to treat these stars differently, given the unknown multiplicity status of much of the sample, and caution our readers to use due care regarding this issue.</p><p>Influence of Spectral peculiarities: Finally, earlytype stars possess several peculiar subclasses (e.g. Ap, Bp, Am, etc. stars) for which anomalous behavior has been reported in the uvbyβ system with respect to their "normal-type" counterparts. Some of these peculiarities have been linked to rotation, which we do account for. We note that peculiar subclasses constitute ∼ 4% of our sample and these stars could suffer unquantified errors in the determination of fundamental parameters when employing a broad methodology based on calibrations derived from mostly normal-type stars (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 &amp; 2</ref> for a complete accounting of the spectral types used for calibrations). As these subclasses were included in the atmospheric parameter validation stage ( § 3), and satisfactory accuracies were still obtained, we chose not to adjust our approach for these stars and estimate the uncertainties introduced by their inclusion is negligible.</p><p>Final Assessment: Our final atmospheric parameter uncertainties are dominated by the systematic effects quantified in § 4.1 and § 4.2, with the additional effects outlined above contributing very little to the total uncertainty. The largest additional contributor comes from the photometric error. Adding in quadrature the sources σ sys , σ num , σ phot , σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> , σ v sin i and σ AV results in final error estimates of 3.4% in T eff and 0.14 dex in log g.</p><p>The use of uvbyβ photometry to determine fundamental stellar parameters is estimated in previous literature to lead to uncertainties of just 2.5% in T eff and 0.1 dex in log g ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Asiain et al. 1997</ref>), with our assessment of the errors somewhat higher.</p><p>The uncertainties that we derive in our Strömgren method work can be compared with those given by other methods.

The model families are compared in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>. The PARSEC solar-metallicity isochrones of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bressan et al. (2012)</ref>, hereafter B12, take into account in a self-consistent manner the pre-main-sequence phase of evolution. The PARSEC models are the most recent iteration of the Padova evolutionary models, with significant revisions to the major input physics such as the equation of state, opacities, nuclear reaction rates and networks, and the inclusion of microscopic diffusion. The models are also based on the new reference solar composition, Z = 0.01524 from Caffau et al. (2011), but can be generated for a wide range of metallicities. The B12 models cover the mass range 0.1 − 12M .</p><p>PARSEC isochrones are attractive because early-type dwarfs have relatively rapid evolution with the pre-mainsequence evolution constituting a significant fraction of their lifetimes, i.e. τ PMS /τ MS is larger compared to stars of later types. For stars with effective temperatures in the range 6500 K -25000 K (approximately spectral types B0-F5), the B12 models predict pre-main sequence lifetimes ranging from ∼ 0.2-40 Myr, mainsequence lifetimes from ∼ 14 Myr -2.2 Gyr, and the ratio τ PMS /τ MS ∼ 1.6 − 2.4%. A star of given initial mass thus can be followed consistently through the pre-MS, MS, and post-MS evolutionary stages. As a consequence, most points in T eff −log g space will have both pre-ZAMS and post-ZAMS ages as possible solutions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the evolution of atmospheric and corresponding photometric properties according to the PARSEC models.</p><p>The solar-metallicity isochrones of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ekström et al. (2012)</ref>, hereafter E12, also use updated opacities and nuclear reaction rates, and are the first to take into account the effects of rotation on global stellar properties at intermediate masses. They are available for both non-rotating stars and stars that commence their lives on the ZAMS with a rotational velocity of 40% their critical rotational velocity (v rot,i /v crit = 0.4); however, the Ekström et al. (2012) models do not take the pre-main sequence phase into account. The E12 models currently exist only for solar metallicity (Z=0.014 is used), but cover a wider range of masses (0.8 − 120M ).</p><p>The E12 models are attractive because they explictly account for rotation, though at a fixed percentage of breakup velocity. All output of stellar evolutionary models (e.g. lifetimes, evolution scenarios, nucleosynthesis) are affected by axial stellar rotation which for massive stars enhances the MS lifetime by about 30% and may increase isochronal age estimates by about 25% <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Meynet &amp; Maeder 2000)</ref>. In terms of atmospheres, for A-type stars, stellar rotation increases the strength of the Balmer discontinuity relative to a non-rotating star with the same color index <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Maeder &amp; Peytremann 1970</ref>). In the E12 models, the convective overshoot parameter was selected to reproduce the observed main sequence width at intermediate masses, which is important for our aim of distinguishing the ages of many field stars clustered on the main sequence with relatively large uncertainties in their surface gravities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows, however, that there is close agreement between the B12 and the rotating E12 models. Thus, there is not a significant difference between the two models in regards to the predicted width of the MS band.</p><p>It should be noted that the uvbyβ grids of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Castelli &amp; Kurucz (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">, 2004</ref>) were generated assuming a solar metallicity value of Z=0.017. As discussed elsewhere, metallicity effects are not the dominant uncertainty in our methods and we are thus not concerned about the very small metallicty differences between the two model isochrone sets nor the third metallicity assumption in the model atmospheres.</p><p>In matching data to evolutionary model grids, a general issue is that nearly any given point in an H-R diagram (or equivalently in T eff -log g space), can be reproduced by multiple combinations of stellar age and mass. Bayesian inference can be used to determine the relative likelihoods of these combinations, incorporating prior knowledge about the distributions of the stellar parameters being estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Bayesian Age Estimation</head><p>A simplistic method for determining the theoretical age and mass for a star on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram is interpolation between isochrones or evolutionary models.

(2007)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Pont &amp; Eyer (2004)</ref>, is that interpolation between isochrones neither accounts for the nonlinear mapping of time onto the H-R diagram nor the non-uniform distribution of stellar masses observed in the galaxy. As a consequence, straightforward interpolation between isochrones results in an age distribution for field stars that is biased towards older ages compared to the distribution predicted by stellar evolutionary theory.</p><p>Bayesian inference of stellar age and mass aims to eliminate such a bias by accounting for observationally and/or theoretically motivated distribution functions for the physical parameters of interest. As an example, for a given point with error bars on the H-R diagram, a lower stellar mass should be considered more likely due to the initial mass function. Likewise, due to the longer mainsequence timescales for lower mass stars, a star that is observed to have evolved off the main sequence should have a probability distribution in mass that is skewed towards higher masses, i.e. because higher mass stars spend a more significant fraction of their entire lifetime in the post-MS stage.</p></div>

There are two main justifications for choosing a uniform age prior: 1) it is the least restrictive choice of prior and 2) at this stage the assumption is consistent with observations that suggest a fairly constant star formation rate in solar neighborhood over the past 2 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Cignoni et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>Since the evolutionary models are logarithmically gridded in age, the relative probability of age bin i is given by the bin width in linear age divided by the total range in linear age:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">P (log(τ i ) ≤ log(τ ) &lt; log(τ i+1 )) = τ i+1 − τ i τ n − τ 0 ,<label>(27)</label></formula><p>where τ n and τ 0 are the largest and smallest allowed ages, respectively. This weighting scheme gives a uniform probability distribution in linear age.</p><p>As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Takeda et al. (2007)</ref>, it is important to understand that assuming a flat prior in linear age corresponds to a highly non-uniform prior in the measured quantities of log T eff and log g. This is due to the nonlinear mapping between these measurable quantities and the physical quantities of mass and age in evolutionary models. Indeed, the ability of the Bayesian approach to implicitly account for this effect is considered one of its main strengths.</p><p>As is standard in the Bayesian estimation of stellar masses, an initial mass function (IMF) is assumed for the prior probability distribution of all possible stellar masses. Several authors point out that Bayesian estimates of physical parameters are relatively insensitive to the mass prior (i.e. the precise form of the IMF assumed), especially in the case of parameter determination over a small or moderate range in mass space. For this work considering BAF stars, the power law IMF of <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Salpeter (1955)</ref> is assumed for the mass prior, so that the relative probability of mass bin i is given by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">P (M i ≤ M &lt; M i+1 ) ∝ M −2.35 i .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>5.2.3. Numerical Methods As <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Takeda et al. (2007)</ref> point out, in Bayesian age estimation interpolation should be performed only along isochrones and not between them. To avoid biasing our derived physical parameters from interpolating between isochrones, we generated a dense grid of PARSEC models. The evolutionary models were acquired with a spacing of 0.0125 dex in log(age/yr) and 0.0001 M in mass. All probabilities were then computed on a 321 × 321 grid ranging from log(age/yr)=6 to 10 and from 1-10 M .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.4.">Age and Mass Uncertainties</head><p>Confidence intervals in age and mass are determined from the one-dimensional marginalized posterior probability distributions for each parameter. Since the marginalized probability distributions can often be assymetric, the region chosen for determining confidence intervals is that of the Highest Posterior Density (HPD). This method selects the smallest range in a parameter that encompasses N % of the probability. The HPD method is discussed in more detail in the appendix.</p><p>Notably, uncertainties in the ages depend on where in the log g and log T eff parameter space the star is located, and whether a pre-main sequence or a post-zeroage-main sequence age is more appropriate. In the premain sequence phase, both atmospheric parameters are important in age determination. For post-ZAMS stars, however, the relative importance of the two parameters changes. When stars are just bouncing back from the ZAMS and are starting to evolve through the MS phase, log g must be known precisely (within the range of ∼4.3 to 4.45) in order to derive a good age estimate. The age at which this bounce occurs will be a function of mass (earlier for more massive stars). Otherwise, once late B, A, and early F stars are comfortably settled on the MS, their evolution is at roughly constant temperature (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> and so the gravity precision becomes far less important, with temperature precision now critical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">THE METHODOLOGY TESTED ON OPEN</head><p>CLUSTERS An important test of our methods is to assess the ages derived from our combination of uvbyβ photometry, atmospheric parameter placement, and comparison to evolutionary models relative to the accepted ages for members of well-studied open clusters. We investigate four such clusters with rigorous age assessment in previous literature: IC 2602, α Persei, the Pleiades, and the Hyades.</p><p>The youngest <ref type="bibr">( 20 − 30 Myr)</ref> open clusters may be age-dated kinematically, by tracing the space motions of individual members back to the time when the stars were in closest proximity to one another (Soderblom 2010). After 1 galactic rotation period, however, individual member motions are randomized to the extent of limiting the utility of the kinematic method. Beyond ∼ 20 − 30 Myr, the most precise open cluster ages come from the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) technique. This method uses the lithium abundances, which diminish predictably with time, of the lowest mass cluster members to converge on precise (∼10%) ages. LDB  <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Stauffer et al. 1999</ref>), and the Pleiades: τ = 125 ± 8 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Stauffer et al. 1998</ref>). The LDB technique does not work past ∼ 250 Myr, so the Hyades is dated based on isochrone fitting in the H-R diagram using stars with high precision distance measurements, with currently accepted age 625 ± 50 Myr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Perryman et al. 1998</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Process</head><p>Membership probabilities, uvbyβ photometry, and projected rotational velocities are obtained for members of these open clusters via the WEBDA open cluster database 6 . For the Pleiades, membership information was augmented and cross-referenced with <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Stauffer et al. (2007)</ref>. Both individual uvbyβ measurements and calculations of the mean and scatter from the literature measurements are available from WEBDA in each of the photometric indices. As the methodology requires accurate classification of the stars according to regions of the H-R diagram, we inspected the spectral types and β indices and considered only spectral types B0-F5 and luminosity classes III-V for our open cluster tests.</p><p>In contrast to the field stars studied in the next section, the open clusters studied here are distant enough for interstellar reddening to significantly affect the derived stellar parameters. The photometry is thus dereddened as described in § 2.2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows the histograms of the visual extinction A V for each cluster, with the impact of extinction on the atmospheric parameter determination illustrated above in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>.</p><p>In many cases, individual cluster stars have multiple measurements of v sin i in the WEBDA database and we select the measurement from whichever reference is the most inclusive of early-type members.

(2012) (including rotation, plotted as dashed lines) with our uvbyβ photometric determinations of the atmospheric parameters. For early and intermediate group stars, the black filled circles represent the v sin i corrected atmospheric parameters (using the FB98 formulae), while the open circles represent the uncorrected parameters. Note that the late-group stars do not receive a v sin i correction but are still plotted as filled circles. In both cases the point sizes are ∝ v sin i. The typical uncertainties in our log T eff and log g determinations are represented by the error bars at the bottom of the figure. These uncertainties correspond to 1.6% or ≈ 0.007 dex in log T eff and 0.091 dex (intermediate), and 0.145 dex (late) in log g, corresponding to the RMS errors as determined in the effective temperature and surface gravity calibrations.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Stauffer et al. (1998)</ref>. Of the ∼ 20 Pleiads that sit below the zero age main sequence, 5 are known pulsators of the δ Scu or γ Dor variety. Additionally, there is an excess of slow rotators sitting below the ZAMS. Possible reasons for this observed behavior include systematics of the atmospheric models (several authors have noted problems with the treatment of convection in ATLAS9 models at this mass range), failure of the evolutionary models to predict the true width of the main sequence (though this effect is unlikely to be as large as the scatter seen here), and overaggressive dereddening procedures.

While the exact cause(s) of the remaining scatter observed in the empirical isochrones for each cluster is not known, possible contributors may be systematic or astrophysical in nature, or due to incorrect membership information. Multiplicity, variability, and spectral peculiarities were among the causes investigated for this scatter, but the exclusion of objects on the basis of these criteria did not improve age estimation for any individual cluster. The number of stars falling below the theoretical ZAMS, particulary for stars with log T eff 3.9, is possibly systematic and may be due to an incomplete treatment of convection by the ATLAS9 models. This source of uncertainty is discussed in further detail in § 8.2.</p><p>For each cluster, we publish the individual stars considered, along with relevant parameters, in <ref type="bibr">Tables 8, 9, 10, &amp; 11</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1.">Ages from Bayesian Inference</head><p>Once atmospheric parameters have been determined, age determination proceeds as outlined in § 5. For each individual cluster member, the χ 2 , likelihood, and posterior probability distribution are calculated for each point on a grid ranging from log(age/yr)=6.5 to 10, with masses restricted to 1 ≤ M/M ≤ 10. The resolution of the grid is 0.0175 dex in log(age/yr) and 0.045 M in mass. The 1-D marginalized posterior PDFs for each individual cluster member are normalized and then summed to obtain an overall posterior PDF in age for the cluster as a whole. This composite posterior PDF is also normalized prior to the determination of statistical measures (mean, median, confidence intervals). Additionally, the posterior PDFs in log(age) for each member are multiplied to obtain the total probability in each log(age) bin that all members have a single age. While the summed PDF depicts better the behavior of individual stars or groups of stars, the multiplied PDF is best for assigning a single age to the cluster and evaluating any potential systematics of the isochrones themselves.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref>, the summed age PDFs for each cluster generally follow the same behavior: (1) the peaks are largely determined by the early group (B-type) stars which have well-defined ages due to their unambiguous locations in the T eff − log g diagram; (2) examining the age posteriors for individual stars, the intermediate group stars tend to overpredict the cluster age relative to the early group stars, and the same is true for the late group stars with respect to the intermediate group stars, resulting in a large tail at older ages for each of the summed PDFs due to the relatively numerous and broad PDFs of the later group stars. For IC 2602 and the Pleiades, the multiplied PDFs have median ages and uncertainties that are in close agreement with the literature ages. Notably, the results of the open cluster tests favor an age for the Hyades that is older (∼ 800 Myr) than the accepted value, though not quite as old as the recent estimate of 950±100 Myr from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brandt &amp; Huang (2015)</ref>. The Bayesian age analysis also favors an age for α Per that is younger (∼ 70 Myr) than the accepted value based on lithium depletion, but older than the canonical 50 Myr from the Upper Main Sequence Turnoff Mermilliod <ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref>. In an appendix, we perform the same analysis for the open clusters on p(τ ) rather than p(log τ ), yielding similar results.</p><p>The results of the open cluster test are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 4</ref>. It is noted that all statistical measures of the marginalized age PDFs quoted hereafter are from PDFs normalized in log(age), as opposed to converting to linear age and then normalizing. This choice was made due to the facts that 1) the isochrones are provided in uniform logarithmic age bins, and 2) the marginalized PDFs of individual stars are more symmetric (and thus better characterized by traditional statistical measures) in log(age) than in linear age. Notably, the median age is equivalent regardless of whether one chooses to analyze prob(log τ ) or prob(τ ). This issue is discussed further in an appendix. In general, there is very close agreement in the Bayesian method ages between B12 and rotating E12 models. For IC 2602 and the Pleiades, our analysis yields median cluster ages (as determined from the multiplied PDFs) that are within 1-σ of accepted values, regardless of the evolutionary models considered. The Bayesian analysis performed with the PARSEC models favor an age for α Persei that is ∼ 20% younger than the currently accepted value, or ∼ 20% older for the Hyades.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2.">Ages from Isochrone Fitting</head><p>As a final test of the two sets of evolutionary models, we used χ 2 -minimization to find the best-fitting isochrone for each cluster. By fitting all members of a cluster simultaneously, we are able to assign a single age to all stars, test the accuracy of the isochrones for stellar ensembles, and test the ability of our uvbyβ method to reproduce the shapes of coeval stellar populations in T eff −log g space. For this exercise, we did not interpolate between isochrones, choosing instead to use the default spacing for each set of models (0.1 dex and 0.0125 dex in log(age/yr) for the E12 and B12 models, respectively). For the best results, we consider only the sections of the isochrones with log g between 3.5 and 5.0 dex. The results of this exercise are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 18</ref>. The bestfitting E12 isochrone (including rotation) is consistent with accepted ages to within 1% for the Pleiades and Hyades, ∼ 15% for IC 2602, and ∼ 44% for α-Per. For the B12 models, the best-fit isochrones are consistent with accepted ages to ∼ 8% for the Pleiades, ∼ 20% for the Hyades and IC 2602, and ∼ 47% for α-Per. The B12 models produce systematically younger ages than the E12 models, by a fractional amount that increases with absolute age.</p><p>As detailed above, the open cluster tests revealed that our method is able to distinguish between ensembles of differing ages, from tens to hundreds of Myr, at least  Literature ages (column 2) come from the sources referenced in § 6. For each set of evolutionary models, the median and 68% confidence interval are computed for both the summed PDF (columns 4,5) and multiplied PDF (columns 6,7). The final column indicates the best-fit isochrone found through χ 2 -minimization of all cluster members in log (T eff ) − log g space. Note, in a statistical sense. For individual stars, large uncertainties may remain, particularly for the later types, owing almost entirely to the difficulty in determining both precise and accurate surface gravities. The open cluster tests also demonstrate the importance of a v sin i correction for early (B0-A0) and intermediate (A0-A3) group stars in determining accurate stellar parameters. While the v sin i correction was not applied to the late group (A3-F5 in this case) stars, it is likely that stars in this group experience non-negligible gravity darkening. The typically unknown inclination angle, i, also contributes significant uncertainties in derived stellar parameters and hence ages.</p><p>7. THE METHODOLOGY APPLIED TO NEARBY FIELD STARS As an application of our developed, calibrated, validated, and tested methodology, we consider the complete HM98 photometric catalog of 63,313 stars. We are interested only in nearby stars that are potential targets for high contrast imaging campaigns, and for which interstellar extinction is negligible. We thus perform a distance cut at 100 pc, using distances from the XHIP catalog <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson &amp; Francis 2012)</ref>. We perform an additional cut in spectral type (using information from XHIP), considering only B0-F5 stars belonging to luminosity classes IV,V, because this is the range for which our method has been shown to work with high fidelity and additionally these are the primary stars of interest to near-term high-contrast imaging surveys. In total, we are left with 3499 stars. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 19</ref> shows the distribution of our field star sample in spectral type, distance, A V , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>, and v sin i. The distributions of photometric errors in given uvbyβ indices are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  20</ref>, and the mean errors in each index are summarized as follows: σ b−y , σ m1 , σ c1 , σ β , σ a0 , σ r * = 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, 0.004, 0.005, 0.005 mag.</p><p>Projected rotational velocities for the sample of nearby field stars are sourced from the <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski (2005)</ref> compilation, which contains v sin i measurements for 2874 of the stars, or ∼ 82% of the sample. For an additional 8 stars v sin i measurements are collected from <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Zorec &amp; Royer (2012)</ref>, and for another 5 stars v sin i values come from <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Schröder et al. (2009)</ref>. For the remaining stars without v sin i measurements, a projected rotational velocity is assumed according to the mean v sin i − T eff relation from Appendix B of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gray (2005)</ref>. Atmospheric parameters are corrected for rotational velocity effects as outlined in § 3.3.</p><p>Atmospheric parameter determination was not possible for six stars, due to discrepant positions in the relevant uvbyβ planes: HIP 8016 (a B9V Algol-type eclipsing binary), HIP 12887 (a poorly studied F3V star), HIP 36850 (a well-studied A1V+A2Vm double star system), HIP 85792 (a well-studied Be star, spectral type B2Vne), HIP 97962 (a moderately studied B9V star), and HIP 109745 (an A0III star, classified in XHIP as an A1IV star).

Equipped with atmospheric parameters for the remaining 3493 stars, and assuming uniform uncertainties of 3.4% and 0.14 dex in T eff and log g, respectively, ages and masses were computed via the process outlined in § 5. Posterior probabilities were calculated on a uniform 321×321 grid of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bressan et al.

Interpolated ages and masses are also included, and these values may be preferred, particularly for objects with an interpolated age 10 8 yr and a log g placing it near the ZAMS (see § 8.2 for more detail). The table of ages and masses for all 3943 stars, including our newly derived atmospheric parameters, are available as an electronic table and a portion (sorted in ascending age) is presented here in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref>. In rare instances (for ∼ 5% of the sample), true 68% and 95% confidence intervals were not obtained due to numerical precision, the star's location near the edge of the computational grid, or some combination of the two effects. In these cases the actual confidence interval quoted is noted as a flag in the electronic table.</p><p>As with the open clusters, we can sum the individual, normalized PDFs in age to produce composite PDFs for various subsets of our sample. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 22</ref> depicts the composite age PDF for our entire sample, as well as age PDFs for the subsets of B0-B9, A0-A4, A5-A9, and F0-F5 stars.

This enables greater accuracy in age determination through isochrone placement for stars in this mass and age range. Fundamentally, our results rely on the accuracy of both the stellar evolution models and the stellar atmosphere models that we have adopted. Accuracy is further set by the precision of the photometry, the derived atmospheric parameters, the calibration of the isochrones, and the ability to determine whether an individual star is contracting onto the main sequence or expanding off of it. By using isochrones that include both pre-MS and post-MS evolution in a self-consistent manner ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bressan et al. 2012</ref>), we can determine pre-ZAMS in addition to post-ZAMS ages for every data point in T eff , log g).

Stars below the main sequence could be easily identified by selecting objects with log (age/yr) Bayes − log (age/yr) interp &gt; 1.0. Notably, for these stars below the MS, the linear interpolation produces more realistic ages than the Bayesian method. A comparison of the Bayesian and interpolated ages for all stars is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 24</ref>.

These parameters place the star essentially on the ZAMS, with an interpolated age of 9 Myr, and calling into question the cometary genesis of its gaseous disk. However, the uncorrected atmospheric parameters (T eff = 9182 ± 309 K, log g = 4.22 ± 0.14 dex) are more consistent with the A1 spectral type and produces an interpolated age of 57 Myr, which seems to support the cometary collision hypothesis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In the absence of finely calibrated empirical age indicators, such as the rotation-activity-age relation for solartype stars (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand 2008)</ref>, ages for early spectral type stars typically have come from open cluster and moving group membership, or through association with a late-type companion that can be agedated through one of the applicable empirical methods. Because of their rapid evolution, early type stars are amenable to age dating via isochrones. In this paper we have investigated the use of Strömgren photometric techniques for estimating stellar atmospheric parameters, which are then compared to isochrones from modern stellar evolution models.</p><p>Bayesian inference is a particularly useful tool in the estimation of parameters such as age and mass from evolutionary models for large samples that span considerable ranges in temperature, luminosity, mass, and age. The Bayesian approach produces unbiased ages relative to a straightforward interpolation among isochrones which leads to age estimates that are biased towards older ages. However, as noted earlier, stars located beyond the range of the theory (below the theoretical ZAMS in our case) are assigned unreasonably old ages with the Bayesian method. This presumably is due to the clustering of isochrones and the dominance of the prior in inference scenarios in which the prior probability is changing quickly relative to the magnitude of the uncertainty in the atmospheric parameters. Linear interpolation for stars apparently below the MS may produce more reasonable age estimates.</p><p>The most important parameter for determining precise stellar ages near the ZAMS is the luminosity or surface gravity indicator. Effective temperatures, or observational proxies for temperature, are currently estimated with suitable precision. However, log g, luminosity, or absolute magnitude (requiring a precise distance as well), are not currently estimated with the precision needed to meaningfully constrain the ages of field stars near the ZAMS. This effect is particularly pronounced for lower temperature stars where, for a given shift in log g, the inferred age can change by many orders of magnitude. Our open cluster tests indicated that the age uncertainties due to the choice of evolutionary models are not significant compared to those introduced by the uncertainties in the surface gravities.</p><p>We have derived new atmospheric parameters (taking stellar rotation into account) and model-dependent ages and masses for 3493 BAF stars within 100 pc of the Sun. Our method of atmospheric parameter determination was calibrated and validated to stars with fundamentally determined atmospheric parameters. We further tested and validated our method of age estimation using open clusters with well-known ages. In determining the uncertainties in all of our newly derived parameters we conservatively account for the effects of systematics, metallicity, numerical precision, reddening, photometric errors, and uncertainties in v sin i as well as unknown rotational velocities.</p><p>Field star ages must be considered with caution. At minimum, our homogeneously derived set of stellar ages provides a relative youth ordering. For those stars below the MS we encourage the use of interpolated ages rather than Bayesian ages, unless more precise atmospheric parameters become available. Using the new set of ages, we presented an empirical mass-age relation for solar neighborhood B0-F5 stars. We also presented empirical relations between spectral type and age/mass and we discussed ages in detail for several famous low mass companion and/or debris disk objects. An anticipated use of our catalog is in the prioritization of targets for direct imaging of brown dwarf and planetary mass companions. <ref type="bibr">David &amp; Hillenbrand (2015b, in preparation)</ref> will explore how ages derived using this methodology can be applied to investigations such as debris disk evolution.</p><p>The This research has made use of the WEBDA database, operated at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Vienna, as well as the SIMBAD database and VizieR catalog access tool, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metallicity Effects</head><p>We do not account explicitly for metallicity in this study, having assumed solar values in both our atmospheric models and our evolutionary grids. Our analysis in the T eff and log g calibrations found that for stars with fundamentally determined atmospheric parameters and available <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> measurements, the accuracy with which we can determine atmospheric parameters using uvbyβ photometry does not vary systematically with metallicity.</p><p>The effects of different metallicity assumptions on the Strömgren index atmospheric grids is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 26</ref>. Moving from the atmospheric grid to the evolutionary grid, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 17</ref> of  illustrates that for the coolest stars under consideration here, which were the focus of their study, variation of metallicity from +0.5 to -0.5 dex in <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> corresponds to a +0.1 to -0.1 dex shift in log g of an evolutionary isochrone. Among hotter stars, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 26</ref> shows that metallicity uncertainty affects temperatures only minorly, and gravities not at all or minimally.</p><p>We similarly calculated the effect on atmospheric parameter determination when allowing the model color grids to vary from +0.5 to -0.5 dex in <ref type="bibr">[M/H]</ref>, which notably represent the extremes of the metallicity range included in our sample (less than 1% of stars considered here have |[Fe/H]| &gt; 0.5 dex). <ref type="bibr">Figures 27 &amp; 28</ref> examine in detail the effects of metallicity on T eff , log g determinations in the relevant uvbyβ planes. In summary, T eff variations of up to ∼ 1% in the (b − y) − c 1 plane, ∼ 2% in the a 0 − r * plane, and 6% in the c 1 − β plane are possible with shifts of ± 0.5 dex in <ref type="bibr">[M/H]</ref>. Notably, however, T eff variations above the 2% level are only expected in the c 1 − β plane for stars hotter than ∼ 17000 K, or roughly spectral type B4, of which there are very few in our sample. Similarly metallicity shifts of ± 0.5 dex can cause variations of ∼ 0.1 dex in log g in the (b − y) − c 1 and c 1 − β planes, while the same variation in the a 0 − r * plane produces surface gravity shifts closer to ∼ 0.05 dex.</p><p>By contrast, metallicity effects are more prominent in color-magnitude techniques. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Nielsen et al. (2013)</ref> executed a Bayesian analysis of the locations in the M V vs B − V diagram of Gemini/NICI targets to derive their ages including confidence contours for the stellar masses, ages, and metallicities. The work demonstrates correlation in this particular color-magnitude diagram of increasing mass and decreasing age with higher metallicity. Metal poor stars will have erroneously young ages attributed to them when solar metallicity is assumed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidence Intervals</head><p>All confidence intervals in age and mass quoted in this work are the bounds of the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Region. For a given posterior probability density, p(θ|x), the 100(1 − α)% HPD region is defined as the subset, C, of θ values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">C = {θ : p(θ|x) ≥ p * } ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where p * is the largest number such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">θ:p(θ|x)≥p * p(θ|x)dθ = 1 − α.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In other words, the HPD region is the set of most probable values (corresponding to the smallest range in θ) that encloses 100(1 − α)% of the posterior mass. The HPD method is particularly suited for finding confidence intervals of skewed probability distributions, such as the stellar age posteriors studied in this work. To find the highest posterior density (HPD) region numerically, a function is created that iteratively integrates a normalized posterior PDF above a test value of p * while the area/volume under the PDF is less than the desired confidence interval.</p></div>

Statistical measures other than the median, such as the mean, mode, confidence intervals, etc. will be different depending on whether the PDF being quantified is p(log τ ) or p(τ ). For example, 10 log τ = τ . Strictly speaking, however, both values are meaningful and authors frequently choose to report one or the other in the literature. In the case at hand, p(log τ ) for an individual star is more symmetric than the linear counterpart, p(τ ).

The rotation correction appears to improve temperature estimates for early group stars, but worsen estimates for the late and intermediate groups. Notably, however, the vast majority of T eff standards are slowly rotating (v sin i &lt; 150 km s −1 ). Note one rapidly rotating intermediate group star extends beyond the scale of the figure, with a rotation corrected T uvby /T fund ratio of ≈ 1.26.</figDesc></figure>

The metallicity values have been taken primarily from Ammons et al. (2006), with additional values coming from Anderson &amp; Francis (2012). While metallicities seem to exist for very few of the surface gravity calibrators used here, there does not appear to be a systematic trend in the residuals with [Fe/H]. There is a larger amount of scatter for the more metal-rich late-type stars, however the scatter is confined to a relatively small range in [Fe/H] and it is not clear that this effect is due to metallicity effects.</figDesc></figure>

The isochrones and mass tracks plotted are those of Bressan et al. (2012). The tail of each vector represents a given point in a specific photometric plane ((b−y)−c 1 for the late group stars in red, a 0 −r * for the intermediate group stars in teal, and c 1 −β for the early group stars in black) and its corresponding value in [T eff , log g]. The tip of the vector points to the new value of [T eff , log g] after each point in photometric space has been "dereddened" assuming arbitrary values of A V . The shifts in uvbyβ space have been computed according to the extinction measurements of Schlegel et al. (1998) and Crawford &amp; Mandwewala (1976), assuming A V 4.237E(b − y). The magnitudes of A V chosen for this figure represent the extremes of values expected for our sample of nearby stars and are meant to illustrate the directionality of the effects of reddening as propagated through the uvbyβ planes. Finally, note for the early group (black vectors), the A V values are an order of magnitude larger and much higher than expected for our sample. Again, this is to illustrate the directionality of the reddening effect, which is particularly small for the early group which rely on c 1 , the Balmer discontinuity index, for temperature, and β, a color between two narrow-band filters with nearly the same central wavelength, for log g.</figDesc></figure>

The bottom panel shows the ratio of the temperature given by a grid of metallicity [M/H]=+0.5 to the temperature given by the solar metallicity grid. In the temperature range of interest (≈ 6500K-8500K, or spectral types F5-A4), a shift of 0.5 dex in [M/H] can produce variations up to ∼ 1% in T eff , with the smallest discrepancies occurring at approximately the F0-A9 boundary.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_14" validated="false"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>assigned an age of 12 Myr to β Pic based on its proposed membership to the moving group of the same name. Isochronal age estimates for the star have ranged from the ZAMS age to 300 Myr (Barrado y Navascués et al. 1999). Nielsen et al. (2013) performed a Bayesian analysis concluding a median age of 109 Myr with a 68% confidence interval of 82-134 Myr. Although barely below the ZAMS, β Pic in our own Bayesian anal- ysis has a much older median age of 524 Myr with a 68% confidence interval of 349-917 Myr. Prior authors also have noted that β Pic falls below the ZAMS on a color- magnitude diagram. As was the case for HR 8799, we conclude that our erroneous age for β Pic is due to the dominance of the prior assumption/s in exactly such</figDesc><table>a 
scenario. 
However, the interpolated age using our atmospheric 
parameters of T eff =8300 K, log g=4.389, is 20 Myr. Us-
ing the Gray et al. (2006) values of T eff =8052 K (within 
1σ of our determination), log g=4.15 (&gt; 1.5σ away from 
our surface gravity) we obtain an interpolated age of 308 
Myr. 

8.3.4. κ And 
κ Andromedae is another proposed member of the 
Columba association (Zuckerman et al. 2011). Using the 
nominal 30 Myr age, Carson et al. (2013) suggested a 
companion discovered via direct imaging is of planetary 
mass (12 − 13M Jup ). Hinkley et al. (2013) refuted this 
claim, concluding an age of 220 ± 100 Myr from multiple 
isochronal analyses in  §3.2 of that work. This older age 
estimate leads to a model-dependent companion mass of 
50 +16 
−13 M Jup . Our Bayesian analysis allows us to nearly 
rule out a 30 Myr age with a 95% confidence interval of 
29-237 Myr. The mean, median, mode, and 68% confi-
dence interval of the 1D marginalized posterior PDF in 
age for κ And are 118, 150, 191, and 106-224 Myr, re-
spectively. Notably, κ And has a projected rotational 
velocity of v sin i ∼ 160 km s −1 (Glebocki &amp; Gnacinski 
2005), and we find its rotation corrected atmospheric pa-
rameters (T eff = 11903 ± 405 K, log g = 4.35 ± 0.14 dex) 
produce an interpolated age of 16 Myr. Using uncor-
rected atmospheric parameters (T eff = 11263 ± 383 K, 
log g = 4.26 ± 0.14 dex) leads to an interpolated age of 
25 Myr. 

8.3.5. ζ Delphini 
De Rosa et al. (2014) recently published the discovery 
of a wide companion to ζ Delphini (HIP 101589). Those 
authors estimated the age of the system as 525±125 
Myr, from the star's positions on a color-magnitude 7.6 7.8 8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9.0
