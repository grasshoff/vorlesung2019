			<abstract>
				<p>We present N-body simulations of resonant planets with inclined orbits that show chaotically evolving eccentricities and inclinations that can persist for at least 10 Gyr. A wide range of behavior is possible, from fast, low amplitude variations to systems in which eccentricities reach 0.9999 and inclinations 179.9 •. While the orbital elements evolve chaotically, at least one resonant argument always librates. We show that the HD 73526, HD 45364 and HD 60532 systems may be in chaotically-evolving resonances. Chaotic evolution is apparent in the 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2 resonances, and for planetary masses from lunar-to Jupiter-mass. In some cases, orbital disruption occurs after several Gyr, implying the mechanism is not rigorously stable, just long-lived relative to the main sequence lifetimes of solar-type stars. Planet-planet scattering appears to yield planets in inclined resonances that evolve chaotically in about 0.5% of cases. These results suggest that 1) approximate methods for identifying unstable orbital architectures may have limited applicability, 2) the observed close-in exoplanets may be produced during the high eccentricity phases induced by inclined resonances, 3) those exoplanets&apos; orbital planes may be misaligned with the host star&apos;s spin axis, 4) systems with resonances may be systematically younger than those without, 5) the distribution of period ratios of adjacent planets detected via transit may be skewed due to inclined resonances, and 6) potentially habitable planets in resonances may have dramatically different climatic evolution than the Earth. The GAIA spacecraft is capable of discovering giant planets in these types of orbits.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Exoplanetary systems with multiple planets show a wide variety of orbital behavior, such as large amplitude oscillations of eccentricity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Laughlin &amp; Adams 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnes &amp; Greenberg 2006)</ref>, mean motion resonances (MMRs) (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee &amp; Peale 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raymond et al. 2008)</ref>, and, in one case, oscillations of inclination ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes et al. 2011</ref>). Here we consider exoplanets in MMRs with mutual inclinations and find that these systems can evolve with large, chaotic fluctuations of eccentricity and inclination for at least 10 Gyr, but the MMR is maintained throughout.</p><p>In general, orbital interactions are broken into two main categories: secular and resonant. The former treats the orbital evolution as though the planets' masses have been spread out in the orbit, i.e. the mass distribution averaged over timescales much longer than the orbital periods. If the orbits are non-circular or non-coplanar, the gravitational forces change the orbital elements periodically.</p><p>MMRs occur when two or more orbital frequencies are close to integer multiples of each other. The planets periodically reach the same relative positions, introducing repetitive perturbations that can dominate over secular effects. The combination drives the long-term evolution of the system. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rivera &amp; Lissauer (2001)</ref>   While most bodies in our Solar System are on low-e, low-i orbits, the exoplanets do not share these traits. Eccentricities span values from 0 to &gt; 0.9 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Butler et al. 2006</ref>), and at least the two outer planets of υ And have a large mutual inclination of 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">• (McArthur et al. 2010)</ref>. Numerous exoplanetary pairs in MMR are known, including the systems of Gl 876, HD 82943, and HD 73526 in 2:1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marcy et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mayor et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Tinney et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Vogt et al. 2005</ref>), HD 45364 in 3:2 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Correia et al. 2009</ref>) and HD 60532 in 3:1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Desort et al. 2008</ref>). The orbital plane of Gl 876 b has been measured astrometrically with HST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benedict et al. 2002)</ref>, and it was reported that this observation was compatible with a mutual inclination between orbital planes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rivera &amp; Lissauer 2003)</ref>, but no formal publication demonstrated that suggestion. The HD 128311 planetary system lies close to the 2:1 resonance, and recent astrometric measurements have measured the orbital plane of HD 128311 c, but not the other planet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2014</ref>). Without knowledge of both orbital planes, the mutual inclinations are unknown and use of the minimum masses and coplanar orbits may not reveal the true orbital behavior, so this system could in fact lie in the 2:1 resonance.</p><p>Several studies have also explored MMRs with mutual inclinations in the context of planet formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Thommes &amp; Lissauer (2003)</ref> found that convergent migration in a planetary disk can excite large inclinations in exoplanetary systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee &amp; Thommes (2009)</ref> performed a similar experiment and found that migrating planets could become temporarily captured in an inclination-type MMR, in which conjunction librates about the midpoint between the longitudes of ascending node (inclination resonances are described in more detail in § 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Libert &amp; Tsiganis (2009)</ref> explored the formation of higher-order inclination resonances and also found that temporary capture in an inclination resonance can occur. They also artificially turned off migration shortly after capture and found the resulting system was stable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Teyssandier &amp; Terquem (2014)</ref> considered this process and identified several constraints on the planetary mass ratio and eccentricities that permit entrance into an inclination resonance. All these studies find that MMRs with inclination can form in the protoplanetary disk, but only for a few specific scenarios, and even then the inclination resonance is likely to be fleeting. None of these studies considered the long-term evolution of the resonant pairs.</p><p>Significant mutual inclinations may also be formed via gravitational scattering events that typically result in the ejection of one planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marzari &amp; Weidenschilling 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chatterjee et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raymond et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes et al. 2011</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Raymond et al. (2010)</ref> also showed that scattering could produce systems in MMRs about 5% of the time, but they did not consider the inclinations of the resultant systems. All these studies reveal that formation of MMRs with mutual inclination is possible, but probably rare.</p><p>While HST has successfully characterized several nearby exoplanetary systems astrometrically, the GAIA space telescope could astrometrically detect hundreds of Jupiter-sized planets (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lattanzi et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sozzetti et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Casertano et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sozzetti et al. 2014</ref>), revealing how common are systems in an MMR with significant mutual inclinations. Against this backdrop, we explore the dynamics of planets with orbital period commensurabilities, significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations. This paper is organized as follows. In § 2 we describe the physics of resonance and our numerical methods. In § 3, we present results of hypothetical systems, including planets in the habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kop- parapu et al. 2013</ref>), as well as giant and dwarf planets in the 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2 commensurabilities. In § 4 we show that planet-planet scattering can produce systems in the 2:1 MMR and with significant mutual inclinations. In § 5 we analyze several known exoplanetary systems and find several that could be evolving chaotically. In § 6 we discuss the results and then conclude in § 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Resonant Dynamics</head><p>MMRs are well-studied, and can be explained intuitively for low, but non-zero, values of e and inclination i <ref type="bibr">(Peale 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Greenberg 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Murray &amp; Dermott 1999</ref>). Stable resonances can be divided into two types: eccentricity and inclination. The difference lies in the locations of the stable longitudes of conjunction, sometimes called the libration center. In an eccentricity (e-type) resonance, the stable longitudes are located at the longitude of periastron of the inner planet ( 1 ), and the apoastron of the outer planet (α 2 ≡ 2 + π). For inclination (i-type) resonances, the stable longitudes lie halfway between the longitudes of ascending node, Ω, of each planet (Ω 1,2 ± π/2) when the reference plane is the fundamental plane. When a system is formed, if conjunction initially occurs near one of these stable points, and if there is a commensurability of mean motions such that the conjunction longitude varies slowly, then conjunction will tend to librate. Furthermore, because the orbits are farthest apart at these libration centers, resonances can reduce the likelihood of close encounters, further maintaining long-term orbital stability.</p><p>Both e-type and i-type resonances are observed in our Solar System, but e-type is far more prevalent, including the Galilean satellite system and the Neptune-Pluto pair. An i-type resonance is observed in the Saturnian satellite pair of <ref type="bibr">Mimas and Tethys (Allan 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Greenberg 1973)</ref>. Neptune and Pluto are particularly relevant to this study, as the pair is in the 3:2 e-resonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cohen &amp; Hubbard 1965)</ref>, and later studies found that the i-resonance arguments also librate on short timescales, but the libration drifts slowly such that the resonant argument actually circulates with a period of ∼ 25 Myr <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Williams &amp; Benson 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Applegate et al. 1986</ref>). Higher order secular resonances are also operating on Neptune and Pluto ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Milani et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kinoshita &amp; Nakai 1996)</ref>, and likely contribute to their configuration being formally chaotic <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Sussman &amp; Wisdom 1988)</ref>. Nonetheless, the pair is stable for at least 5.5 Gyr ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kinoshita &amp; Nakai 1996)</ref>. Thus, Pluto and Neptune's orbital evolution is impacted by the i-resonance but it is likely a small effect.</p><p>The first step in identifying a mean motion resonance is to examine the ratio of orbital periods P or, equivalently, the mean motions n ≡ 2π/P . If the ratio is close to a ratio of two integers, i.e. n 1 /n 2 ≈ j 1 /j 2 where j 1 and j 2 are integers, then the system may be in resonance. An MMR requires a periodic force to applied near the same longitude relative to an apse or a node, which precess with time. To account for this evolution, celestial mechanicians have introduced the resonant argument, a combination of angles that account for both the mean motions and the orbital orientations.</p><p>For e-type resonances, the resonant arguments are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ 1,2 = j 1 λ 2 − j 2 λ 1 − j 3 1,2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the j terms are integers that sum to 0, and the subscripts 1 and 2 to correspond to the inner and outer planet, respectively. Should any θ librate with time, or even circulate slowly, then resonant dynamics are important. Conjunction (j 1 λ 2 − j 2 λ 1 ) lies close to a particular longitude relative to the apsides. Usually θ will librate about either 0 or π, but other stable values are possible and are referred to as asymmetric resonances. For i-type resonances, the dominant resonant argument is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ = j 1 λ 2 − j 2 λ 1 − j 3 Ω 1 − j 4 Ω 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>if i = 0 corresponds to the invariable, or fundamental, plane, i.e. the plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum of the system. With this choice, Ω 1 = Ω 2 ± π. Inclination resonances are fundamentally different from e-type in that first order resonances are technically not possible, i.e. j 1 − j 2 &gt; 1. The stable conjunction longitudes correspond to the two midnode longitudes. Note that for circular orbits, there is no substantive difference between the two stable longitudes: The geometry at ± 90 • from the mutual node are identical. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Greenberg (1977)</ref> for more discussion on the physics of the i-resonance. It is often convenient to think of resonances in terms of a pseudo-potential. The conjunction longitude, λ c is accelerated toward the stable points, and oscillates sinusoidally about it. The acceleration of λ c in a 2:1 (4:2) MMR can be written as¨λ as¨ as¨λ c = c 1 e 1 sin(λ c − 1 )+c 2 e 2 sin( 2 −λ c )+c 3 i 2 1 sin 2(λ c −Ω 1 ), (3) where c 1 , c 2 and c 3 are constants that depend on the masses and semi-major axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Greenberg 1977)</ref>, and λ c = 2λ 2 − λ 1 . Eq. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> is analogous to that of a compound pendulum, as long as the e's and i's are approximately constant. The pseudo-potential contains minima at 1 , α 2 , and Ω 1 ± π/2, but each has different depths which vary as the orbits evolve. Moreover, as e and/or i become large, this simple picture breaks down and more minima will likely appear. Thus, we should anticipate the motion to become complicated, an expectation that is borne out in § § 3 -5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Numerical Methods</head><p>The classical analytic theory summarized above becomes less accurate as the values of eccentricity and inclination increase. To lowest order, the evolution of e and i are decoupled, but as either or both become large, pathways for the exchange of angular momentum open up, and the motion can become very complicated (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barnes et al. 2011</ref>). Thus, we rely on N -body numerical methods to analyze resonances with mutual inclinations, while appealing to published analytic theory to help interpret the outcomes. In particular we use the well-tested and reliable Mercury (Chambers 1999) and HNBody <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rauch &amp; Hamilton 2002)</ref> codes. We do not include general relativistic corrections, which are mostly negligible for the planetary systems we consider here. We used both mixed variable symplectic and Bulirsch-Stoer methods to integrate our systems. While the former can integrate our hypothetical systems to 10 Gyr within about 10 days on a modern workstation, the BulirschStoer method, which is more accurate, requires about 80-90 days with HNBody; hence we used it sparingly. Regardless of our choice of software and/or integration scheme, identical initial conditions produced qualitatively similar results. All integrations presented here conserved energy to better than 1 part in 10 5 , usually better by many orders of magnitude. Unless stated otherwise, all systems maintained an MMR for 10 Gyr and met our energy conservation requirements. The reference plane for i and Ω for all cases is the invariable plane so that the inclinations and longitudes of ascending node are more physically meaningful <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . Here we ignore planetary and stellar spins: Planets and stars are point masses.</p><p>We consider several broad categories of exoplanetary systems. First we model systems in the 2:1 resonance. In Set #1, one planet is always 1 Earth-mass (1 M ⊕ ) with a semi-major axis a of 1 AU, and the primary is a solar-mass star, i.e. it is in the habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kopparapu et al. 2013</ref>). The other planet may have a mass between 3 and 40 M ⊕ . In Set #2, we explore the case of two giant planets orbiting a 0.75 M star in 2 and 4 year orbits. Set #3 considers two dwarf planets orbiting a solar-mass star. In Sets #4 and #5, we simulated ∼Earth-mass planets in the 3:1 and 3:2 MMR, respectively. For all these simulations, the period ratios are at exact resonance, but the other orbital elements are chosen randomly and uniformly over a wide range of values. For each set, we integrated 100 systems for 10 Myr as an initial survey, and for systems that appeared interesting, i.e. showed chaotic evolution, we continued them to 10 Gyr using 0.01 year timesteps. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the ranges of initial conditions we used for these sets of hypothetical systems.</p><p>In § 5 we examine known systems in or near the 2:1 (HD 73526 and HD 128311), 3:2 (HD 60532) and 3:1 (HD45364) MMRs. Each of these systems was discovered via radial velocity data, and hence suffer from the mass-inclination degeneracy. However, HD 128311 c has also been detected astrometrically with <ref type="bibr">HST (McArthur et al. 2014</ref>), hence its mass and full orbit are known. The best fits and uncertainties in parentheses for these known systems are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The position of each planet in its orbit, the "phase," is crucial information and different authors present the information in different formats and so we present the parameter used in the most recent paper in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. T p is the time of periastron passage, λ is the mean longitude and µ is the mean anomaly.</p><p>For each of the known systems, we vary each orbital element uniformly within its published uncertainties and simulate the orbital evolution with HNBody. Our goal is not to calculate a probability that each system is in an i-type resonance, but rather to determine if it is possible at all. We simulate 100 versions of the these systems and allow i and Ω to take any value, and m is adjusted accordingly. If chaotic motion in the MMR is apparent, we integrate it for a further 10 Gyr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">HYPOTHETICAL SYSTEMS</head><p>In this section we present the results of the simulations described in the previous section. We separate the results by resonance: 2:1, then 3:1, and finally 3:2. In all cases we find evidence of chaotic orbital evolution, often with very large amplitudes of eccentricity and inclination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The 2:1 Resonance</head><p>In this section we examine example cases in Sets #1-3, i.e. in the 2:1 MMR. The e-resonance arguments are</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ 1,2 = 2λ 2 − λ 1 − 1,2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and the i-resonance argument is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ = 4λ 2 − 2λ 1 − Ω 1 − Ω 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>3.1.1. Earth with an Exterior Companion (Set #1)</p><p>Set #1 consists of an Earth-mass planet with a 1 year period and a larger exterior planet with an orbital period of 2 years. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> we show the evolution of the resonant arguments, e and i for the first example, System A in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, for the first 10 5 years.</p><p>The top two panels show that the resonance arguments switch between libration and circulation. Initially θ 1 (black dots) librates about 0, the classic libration center for e-type resonances, while θ 2 (red dots) librates on short timescales, but circulates on long timescales. Also     note that the e-and i-resonance arguments appear to be coupled. During this initial phase, φ librates with large amplitude. After about 14,000 years, the behavior changes dramatically and all arguments librate, but with sudden jumps between libration centers. Then at 25,000 years, the motion appears to return to the initial state. This switching between modes of oscillation demonstrates the system is chaotic, and is often an indicator of impending instability (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laskar 1990</ref>). Hence we would naively expect a similar outcome for this system. The eccentricity of the inner planet shows unusual behavior that also changes with the resonance arguments. The evolution is approximately periodic, but does not appear regular. The inclinations do not appear to be strongly impacted by the changes in the resonance argument behavior.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Set MMR M * (M ) m 1 m 2 a 1 (AU) a 2 (AU) e i ( • ) Ω ( • ) ω ( • ) λ ( • ) 1 2:1 1 1 M ⊕ 3.3-36.6 M ⊕ 1 1.5874 0-0.5</formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">System M * (M ) Planet m (M Jup ) P (d) e ω ( • )</formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">T peri (JD) b µ ( • ) c λ ( • )</formula></div>

Here we see that the hints of chaotic behavior in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> remain present, but are not indicative of the true scale of the chaotic motion for this system. Remarkably, the system survives for 10 Gyr despite the chaos. The eccentricity of the inner planet aperiodically reaches values larger than 0.65, while its inclination reaches 40 • . The outer planet is more massive, so its evolution does not have as large an amplitude as the inner, but it, too, evolves chaotically. While the variations in e and i are chaotic, there are clearly bounds to their permitted values.</p><p>The libration and slow circulation of the resonant arguments suggest that both e and i-type resonances are important in this system. We further explore the evolution of the system in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, which only considers the first 30,000 years of orbital evolution. In the left panel we compare the conjunction longitude (black dots) with the  various stable longitude predicted from classic resonant theory, 1 (purple curve), α 2 ≡ 2 + π (orange curve), Ω + 1 ≡ Ω 1 + π/2 (blue curve), and Ω − 1 ≡ Ω 1 − π/2 (green curve). Conjunction librates, but, surprisingly, not always about the expected stable longitudes. For most of the time, λ c ∼ 1 , but it also librates about other locations that are not associated with any classic libration center. Note that conjunction avoids α 2 .</p><p>In the right panel, we plot the two mean motions and see that they librate about the resonant frequencies, but with varying amplitudes. Careful inspection of the two panels shows that the different mean motion amplitudes correspond to the different librations seen in the left panel. There appear to be 5 different resonant oscillations over this cycle, which approximately repeats for at least the first 1 Myr.</p><p>The long-term behavior in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> shows mode-switching can occur on longer timescales as well. For example, from 6.5 -6.8 Gyr, e and i are confined to narrow regions, but then return to the large amplitude oscillations. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> shows the evolution over 10 5 years starting at 6.75 Gyr within this alternative mode. In comparison to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>, the i-resonance argument is circulating, as is θ 2 . However, θ 1 is librating about 0 indicating that the system is exclusively in an e-type resonance.</p><p>After 10 Gyr the evolution is qualitatively similar to the initial evolution. The e-and i-resonant arguments are switching between libration and circulation, a quasistable behavior. We are unaware of any study that has found qualitatively similar behavior in a planetary or satellite system. While long-lived chaos is evident in our Solar System (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sussman &amp; Wisdom 1988)</ref>, the amplitudes of the variations are much smaller. Moreover, the switching between different quasi-periodic states is also usually an indicator of instability. System A is not "nearly integrable," as is often argued for stable planetary systems. Nonetheless, these planets remains bound and in resonance for the main sequence lifetime of a solartype star.</p><p>Although the orbital behavior of System A is surprising, this case is not anecdotal. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> contains 6 examples from Set #1 that show chaotic evolution, yet remain in resonance for 10 Gyr. In Figs. 5-7, we show 3 more cases as representative examples of the 2:1 MMR. These simulations demonstrate that chaotic inclined MMRs can produce behavior that spans a range from high frequency, low amplitude oscillations to low frequency and high amplitude oscillations to cases in which all available phase space is sampled.</p><p>System B is an example of high frequency, low amplitude evolution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref> shows the first 25,000 years of its evolution. In this case the resonant arguments oscillate with a period of a few hundred years and switch states at ∼18,000 years. The eccentricities and inclinations of the Earth-like planet oscillate with an amplitude of 0.1 and 0.25 • , respectively, on this timescale. Note that System B begins with a mutual inclination of just 1.65 • , revealing that relatively small mutual inclinations can lead to chaotic orbital evolution. Over 10 Gyr, e 1 remains below 0.14 and e 2 0.06, while i 1 remains below 18 • and i 2 below 1 • .</p><p>System C is similar to System A in its evolution, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>. Over 10 Gyr e 1 varies from 0 to 0.9 and i 1 varies from 0 to 60 • . From ∼ 3 Gyr to ∼ 6 Gyr (not shown) the system enters a different mode in which the eccentricities and inclinations are confined to narrower regions.</p><p>System D only survives in the resonance for 73 Myr, but we it include here to illustrate the extreme eccentricity evolution that is possible in inclined MMRs. At 87,170 years, e 1 reaches a value of 0.99998, implying a periastron distance that would place it inside the core of its solar-mass primary. Clearly, the point-mass approximation for the orbital dynamics has broken down for this system. In particular, we expect that at when e 1 ∼ 1 that strong tidal effects should dramatically alter the orbits. We return to this point in § 6.</p><p>Rather than show similar plots for Systems E-G, we only comment on their behavior. System E shows a circulating φ for the first 10 5 years, while θ 1 librates with large amplitude about 0, and θ 2 drifts. The inner planet's e and i vary from 0 to 0.75 and 55 • , respectively. After ∼ 6 Gyr, the system slowly moves into a different state with i 1 varying between 20 • and 50 • , and θ 1 aperiodically circulating. System F has resonant arguments that switch between libration and circulation as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> and eccentricities that remain below 0.3 and inclinations below 20 • . System G is similar to System A.</p><p>These examples are only illustrative and do not represent the full range of possibilities. The 7 cases listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> met our stability criteria (see § 2), and we suspect many more cases also would, but computational constraints prevented a more thorough analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">FORMATION BY SCATTERING</head><p>The large amplitude chaotic orbital evolution shown above is remarkable, but can such a system form? As described in § 1, several studies have examined the formation of inclination resonances in the context of convergent migration during the protoplanetary disk phase. Those studies found that i-resonances can form under the proper circumstances, but they did not consider the postformation evolution. In this section, we show that gravitational scattering among planets can produce systems in the 2:1 MMR with mutual inclinations that evolve chaotically for 10 Gyr.</p><p>Our sample comes from the data set used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raymond et al. (2008)</ref> that found MMRs resulting from scattering events. The reader is referred to that paper for details, but briefly, systems consisting of initially 3 planets were allowed to interact gravitationally and in many cases 1-2 planets were ejected from the system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raymond et al. (2008)</ref> examined the e-resonance arguments of systems in which 2 planets remained, and reported that 5% of systems had at least one e-resonance argument librating. Systems like those shown in § 3 were deemed unstable and thrown out.</p><p>In light of the results of § 3 we have re-examined systems near an MMR to search for chaotic, but long-lived evolution. Specifically we focus on the "Mixed2" distribution of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raymond et al. (2008)</ref> in which the planets' masses follow a power-law distribution with exponent −1.1. This distribution has recently been shown to reproduce many observed dynamical properties of exoplanets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Timpe et al. 2013</ref>). This suite of simulations consisted of 1000 systems, and we examined 49 that had period ratios with 10% of 2, of which 24 were identified as being in an e-resonance by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Raymond et al. (2008)</ref>. Of these, 27 had mutual inclinations less than 5 • and the largest was 27 • . We find three that appear qualitatively similar to those in the previous section. They are listed in Table 8, and System X is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 15</ref>. System Y (not shown) evolved such that the eccentricities and inclinations remained below 0.12 and 7 • , respectively. System Z evolved such that they remained below 0.15 and 3 • . We also searched for systems evolving chaotically in the 3:1 or 3:2 MMR, but did not find any.</p><p>The amplitudes of the variations of the orbital elements is lower than some cases shown in § 3, but similar to others, e.g. System B. Given the small number of systems that produced chaotic resonant behavior, it remains to be seen if evolution that reaches e ∼ 1 and i ∼ π can be naturally produced. Nonetheless we conclude that planet-planet scattering can produce systems that evolve chaotically for 10 Gyr in an MMR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">KNOWN SYSTEMS</head><p>The previous two sections established the typical characteristics of planets in inclined MMRs and a viable formation mechanism. The next question that naturally arises is if any known systems might be evolving in a long-lived and chaotic configuration. In this section we examine four candidates in 3 different MMRs and with observed properties listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. These planets were all discovered by the radial velocity technique and hence their orbital planes were undetected. HD 128311 c has been detected astrometrically ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2014</ref>), but its companion planet has not, so the mutual inclination remains unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">2:1 Systems: HD 128311 and HD 73426</head><p>We performed 100 integrations of HD 128311 and HD 73526 for 10 Myr each.

In <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref> we list three versions that are stable for 10 Gyr and show chaotic evolution. Note that we always use a stellar mass of 1.08 M . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 16</ref> we show the evolution of System AB. Unlike the previous systems, the resonant arguments do not appear to switch between libration and circulation, and the i-arguments do not show any libration at all. The θ 1 argument librates about 0 for the full 10 Gyr year duration. Nonetheless, the eccentricities and inclinations appear to be coupled and to switch between modes, as was seen in § 3. Systems AA and AC show similar behavior with similar amplitudes. Of the previous systems, HD 73526 is most similar to System B (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The previous three section have demonstrated that 1) planets in an MMR and with mutual inclinations can experience chaotic evolution of orbital elements for Gyr while at least 1 resonant argument librates throughout, 2) planet-planet scattering, in which one planet is removed from a planetary system by gravitational interactions, can leave behind two planets in the 2:1 MMR and with significant mutual inclinations, and 3) several systems known to be in an MMR could have mutual inclinations that induce chaotic evolution, but maintain the resonance. In this section, we discuss the theoretical and observational implications of these results, as well as describe the limits of our analysis, which naturally leads to directions for future research on this topic. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> shows that conjunction can librate about multiple centers, some of which, such as 1 , are predicted by classic celestial mechanics. These libration centers are derived from low-order expansions of the "disturbing function" (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Murray &amp; Dermott (1999)</ref>). If one term dominates, there are specific stable longitudes for conjunction, e.g. 1 if the term 2λ 2 − λ 1 − 1 dominates. However, with large and varying values of e and i multiple terms are important. Stable longitudes can migrate or become unstable, allowing transitions of libration to different kinematic modes. This movement could be due to the deepening of nearby minima as e and/or i changes. As the orbits evolve, conjunction could gain access to another minimum, leading to a change in the libration center.</p><p>The behavior has multiple drivers that each behave like a pendulum. In effect, the system is analogous to a compound pendulum, e.g. Eq. (3). As the system evolves, the planets are able to move into different modes of oscillation. For some modes, the stable longitude is represented by classic longitudes like 1 , but others may only be derivable using higher order theory. Our hypothesis should be testable from derivation of high-order models of resonant behavior from the disturbing function. Such an analysis was beyond the scope of this work, which is just a demonstration of the amplitude and duration of the chaos, but is clearly desirable.</p><p>This result has important implications for theoretical work on orbital stability. Common approaches for identifying unstable orbits rely on short integrations (∼ 1000 orbits) and a subsequent analysis of the orbital evolution to count the number of frequencies in the orbital oscillations: a larger number could indicate the system is chaotic and unstable. Examples include the Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO; (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Cin- cotta &amp; Simó 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Go´zdziewskiGo´zdziewski et al. 2001)</ref>) and frequency maps (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Laskar 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Laskar &amp; Correia 2009)</ref>.      Our results suggest that those methods are susceptible to labeling long-lived systems as short-lived. The investigation of viable orbital architectures of planets in an inclined MMR should seek configurations that can persist for the age of the host star as described here, which appear unstable on the short term, but are in fact longlived. For example, HD 202206 is likely in a 5:1 MMR, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Correia et al. (2005)</ref> used a frequency analysis to constrain the orbital parameters rather than N-body models. Future work should explore the the veracity of these approximate methods for the case of inclined MMRs. At epochs of very high e, we expect some planets to tidally circularize. For example, Systems D and U could not persist as shown because tides would circularize the planet. Two scenarios are plausible, depending on the dissipation rate in the planet. If the dissipation is relatively weak, the resonance may be maintained such that the resonant pair migrates inward together. Such systems should be represented in radial velocity and transit surveys, which are biased toward the detection of planets on relatively short orbital periods. The three cases presented in § 5 are possible examples. In principle, the inward migration could be arrested if the tidal dissipation forces the pair into a configuration that diminishes the maximum eccentricity. Thus, planets found far from the host star today could nonetheless have formed at larger distances and moved in. As the dissipation can be episodic, it could take a long time for the pair to migrate inward significantly, further increasing the likelihood to detect the planets where tidal forces are expected to be insignificant. This possibility has been discussed for nonresonant systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Li et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dawson &amp; Chiang 2014</ref>), and we find it can also occur for MMRs. Future work should explore the role of tidal dissipation in these systems and determine if there is any predicted or observed signature of tidal evolution resulting from an inclined MMR.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">System Body m (M Jup ) a (AU) e i ( • ) f Ω ( • ) f ω ( • ) µ ( • ) AA</formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">System Body m (M Jup ) a (AU) e i ( • ) f Ω ( • ) f ω ( • ) µ ( • ) BA b</formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">Body m (M Jup ) a (AU) e i ( • ) f Ω ( • ) f ω ( • ) µ ( • ) b</formula><p>On the other hand, if the tidal dissipation in the planet is very large, it may break the resonance, resulting in rapid tidal circularization and migration, leaving one close-in planet and one more distant a planet. Although many close-in planets are singletons <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Steffen et al. 2012</ref>), some are known to host more distant companions. These companions have been suggested as perturbers that could drive eccentricities to high values through Kozai-type oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Takeda &amp; Rasio 2005)</ref>, but the possibility of resonant excitation of eccentricity has not previously been proposed.</p><p>Note that these periods of high-e can occur when i has a wide range of values. Thus, the planet's final orbital plane could be independent of its initial orbital plane and be misaligned with its host star's spin axis. Such spin-orbit misalignment is observed ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Triaud et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hirano et al. 2014</ref>), and numerous mechanisms have been proposed, such as planet-planet scattering followed by tidal circularization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chatterjee et al. 2008)</ref>, tidal circularization during phases of high eccentricity due to interactions with very distant perturbers (Fab-   rycky &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tremaine 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Storch et al. 2014</ref>), and interactions with the gas disk and a distant stellar binary companion (Batygin 2012). The chaotic evolution of e and i in an inclined MMR is another process to add to this list. However, given the low occurrence rate of chaotic inclination resonances formed by scattering, it is unlikely to be a dominant mechanism. But note that this inference is based on only one set of scattering simulations with specific initial conditions -others may be more efficient and producing these types of systems.</p><p>Inclined MMRs could impact the distribution of period ratios of planets found via transit by making one planet's orbital plane significantly different from the other. After applying a geometric transit correction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Steffen &amp; Hwang (2014)</ref> find a relative excess of planets in the 3:2 resonance and relative deficits in 2:1 and 3:1 in Kepler data. However, for the systems in which only 2 planets are detected, the excess of 3:2 pairs disappears, the 2:1 is still depleted, and the 3:1 appears to be unaffected. If additional planets destabilize inclined MMRs, then the trend in the 3:2 MMR may be indicative of inclined MMRs, as we would not expect systems that evolve with large amplitude to have companions nearby. However, caution is necessary when interpreting these data, as knowledge of the underlying population and the role of tidal evolution is critical. Migration during the protoplanetary disk phase often leads to capture into resonance <ref type="bibr">(Snell- grove et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee &amp; Peale 2002)</ref>, producing a primordial excess of planets in MMRs. On the other hand, tidal evolution of planets in MMRs tends to pull them to period ratios that are not exactly commensurate <ref type="bibr">(Lith- wick &amp; Wu 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Batygin &amp; Morbidelli 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Delisle &amp; Laskar 2014</ref>). Moreover, the formation of inclined resonant orbits of close-in planets is unknown, so they could be intrinsically rare. Thus, it is not obvious that inclined MMRs are sculpting the close-in exoplanet population, but our results suggest that they could.</p><p>Future work should identify boundaries to the longlived but chaotic resonances discovered here and employ a quantitative description of the chaos. All of our simulations of hypothetical systems began with planetary orbital periods at exact commensurability, but this state is not typically observed for exoplanets, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> and § 5. A large suite of N-body simulations that integrate systems to 10 Gyr is required to map out the boundaries of the chaotic and resonant behavior. Throughout this study we have referred to systems as chaotic as they clearly are. However, as a system moves toward regular motion, the motion might no longer be obviously chaotic. The use of Lyapunov exponents or other metrics would be necessary to elucidate the true boundaries of the longlived chaotic motion.</p><p>Identifying inclined MMRs in transit and/or RV data is possible but difficult (see e.g. ), but astrometric measurements are probably the best route to find their existence. HST has successfully detected some planets for which RV detections suggest an MMR is present ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Benedict et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2014</ref>) and two planets not in an MMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2010</ref>), but has not detected two planets in an MMR. The outer planet of HD 128311 has been detected, and the inner is potentially detectable with HST ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McArthur et al. 2014</ref>), but its precarious architecture relative to dynamical instability suggests it is in a coplanar configuration.</p><p>The most likely instrument to discover planets in an inclined MMR is GAIA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Casertano et al. 2008</ref>), as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. The known systems we examined in § 5 are all good candidates for GAIA astrometry, and so in the next 5 years we should find out if any of them could be experiencing chaotic evolution.</p><p>We note that our simulations of known systems failed to reveal any in which the i arguments librate. Instead the e-arguments switch between circulation and libration, which likely drives the chaos. Note that System B evolves in a similar manner, and many other cases do as well. Of our 3 systems formed by scattering, 2 were similar to the known systems <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 15)</ref>. A further exploration of known systems, either by including more or broadening the parameter space survey, could reveal if this trend is real. If known systems are only consistent with i-argument circulation, it could provide important clues to the formation and frequency of exoplanets in inclined MMRs.</p><p>Throughout this study we have described systems that survive for 10 Gyr as "stable." As most of our host stars are solar analogs, this usage is reasonable as the systems survive for the main sequence lifetimes of the host stars. However, in some cases we find destabilization can occur on &gt; 1 Gyr timescales. Hence, these systems are not "stable" in the sense that they could survive indefinitely. Late-term destabilization of systems in inclined MMRs may explain the observation that the host stars of planets in the 2:1 MMR tend to be younger than other host stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Koriski &amp; Zucker 2011)</ref>. If this observation is validated, it would support the hypothesis that some MMRs evolve chaotically and disrupt on long timescales.</p><p>In the previous sections we did not consider the role of additional planets, which could significantly shrink the longevity of a chaotically evolving system. It is clear that for system in which e 1 ∼ 1 that interior planets are forbidden. However, exterior planets could exist provided they are distant and/or small. On the other hand, some systems show low amplitude chaotic variations and may therefore be robust to perturbations from a third planet. We do not map out the role of a third companion in the stability of our systems, but future work should explore how they modify the results presented here.</p><p>Most of our simulations begin with an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU from a solar-mass star, and would be considered potentially habitable ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kasting et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kop- parapu et al. 2013</ref>). If habitable, these worlds would be markedly different from the Earth, with unpredictable climates on geologic timescales. For planets in which the eccentricity grows large, the planet could occasionally enter a runaway greenhouse (incident radiation flux scales as (1−e 2 ) −1/2 ) rendering the planet uninhabitable. Large inclination fluctuations can also lead to large variations in obliquity, which is a major driver of climate evolution (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Williams &amp; Kasting 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Spiegel et al. 2009</ref>). While extremely fast and large variations of obliquity could be detrimental to habitability, at the outer edge of the habitable zone, these variations can suppress ice sheet growth and, in principle, increase a planet's habitability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Armstrong et al. 2014</ref>). For planets that occasionally reach very high eccentricity, tidal dissipation could ultimately pull the planet out of the habitable zone ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Barnes et al. 2008</ref>). Should any potentially habit- able planets be found in an MMR, it will be imperative to understand the orbital evolution, and its connection to climate, prior to investing spectroscopic observations of its atmosphere to search for biosignatures (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Dem- ing et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kaltenegger &amp; Traub 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Misra et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have simulated the orbital evolution of exoplanets in mean motion resonances and inclinations and found the orbits can evolve chaotically for at least 10 Gyr. We hypothesize that these systems behave like compound pendula, which are naturally chaotic systems that can switch between modes of oscillation, as seen in our simulations (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>). We find this chaotic motion over a range of mass ratios and for the 2:1, 3:2 and 3:1 resonance. We also tested different N-body codes using different integration schemes, and conclude the results are robust. Inclined MMRs can be produced by planetplanet scattering and the resultant systems are qualitatively similar to our simulations of known systems in an MMR.</p><p>These results have numerous implications for both theory and observations:</p><p>• Approximate methods to estimate stability with short integrations may be unreliable near MMRs.</p><p>• Close-in planets may arrive at their current orbits due to eccentricity excitation by inclined MMRs followed by rapid tidal circularization.</p><p>• Some short-period planets with orbital planes misaligned with the stellar spin axis may be produced by systems initially in inclined MMRs.</p><p>• MMR pairs may be episodically migrating inward due to weak dissipation occurring during epochs of very large eccentricity.</p><p>• Systems in an MMR may be systematically younger than other multiplanet systems due to the destabilization of older MMR systems.</p><p>• The distribution of period ratios of adjacent planets detected via transit may be skewed by inclined MMRs.</p><p>• Potentially habitable planets may be severely impacted by the orbital architecture of the system.</p><p>Although no systems are currently known to demonstrate the behavior we have outlined here, the GAIA space telescope has the power to detect hundreds of giant exoplanets in inclined MMRs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>considered the long-term behavior of Gl 876 (Marcy et al. 2001) and their integrations show hints of chaotic evolu- tion on 100 Myr timescales (see their Fig. 4b).
