				<p>We investigate the membership in double, triple or higher-­-order-­-multiplicity systems of 54 pairs with at least one bright M dwarf in the solar neighbourhood. These M dwarfs are potential targets of radial-­-velocity surveys for exoplanets. We measure angular separations and position angles from optical images taken with TCP and CAMELOT at the IAC80 telescope at the Observatorio del Teide, and complement them with our measurements on photographic plate digitizations. We also use data in the Washington Double Star Catalogue and other bibliographic sources. We confirm the physical binding of 52 multiple systems, for which we comprehensively compile, derive and provide basic astrophysical parameters in a homogeneous way (spectral types, heliocentric distances, projected physical separations, individual masses, estimated orbital periods, binding energies). Of the 52 systems, 38 are double, 11 are triple and three are quadruple with a variety of architectures. Four systems contain white dwarfs, six systems display variations of position angle larger than 12 deg (1/30 orbit) on a scale of decades and seven systems are located at less than 10 pc. We provide new information, or correct published data, of the most remarkable multiple systems and identify some of them for high-­-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-­-up.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observations</head><p>Originally, the observation programme that led to the results presented here was aimed at imaging stars selected as potential targets for upcoming near-­-infrared radial-­-velocity exoplanet surveys (such as HPF 2 , SPIRou 3 or, especially, CARMENES 4 ).</p><p>Such stars must be the least-­-active, brightest, latest-­-type M dwarfs 5 with no companions at less than 5 arcsec (a separation at which the flux of any visual or physical companion could affect the radial-­-velocity measurement of the main target <ref type="bibr">6</ref> ). We used the 0.82-­-m IAC80 telescope at the Observatorio del Teide for imaging 103 fields with at least one such M dwarf. The targets were selected from a large list of potential targets because of poor UCAC3 <ref type="bibr">7</ref> optical photometry (at the time of preparing the observations, UCAC4 <ref type="bibr">8</ref> had not yet been published), presence of nearby sources in virtual-­-observatory images that may prevent accurate spectroscopic follow-­-up, or even membership in hypothetical common proper-­-motion pairs or multiple systems of unknown status. The observations were performed in service mode from mid-­-2012 to the beginning of 2013.</p><p>Owing to a problem in one of the instruments at the IAC80, we observed 99 fields with the Tromsø CCD Photometer (TCP 9 ) and four fields only with the Cámara Mejorada Ligera del Observatorio del Teide <ref type="bibr">(CAMELOT 10</ref>   <ref type="figure">1)</ref>. We used the imexam task within the IRAF environment or the distance task within the Aladin sky atlas 11 for measuring on-­-CCD separations between stellar photocentroids depending on the quality of the match of their point-­-spread functions to a Gaussian profile (the brightest stars had guyot-­-like PSFs).</p><p>Uncertainties were calculated by error propagation. The Aladin measure errors were higher than IRAF's due to the uncertainty in the by-­-eye estimation of the stellar photocentroids (about 0.4 arcsec; i.e., a bit less than one TCP pixel), but still acceptable for our purposes. We studied a further nine pairs for which we had controversial information on common proper motion, such as very different catalogued values of proper motion, or of ρ or θ at the first and last epochs as tabulated by WDS or with respect to our own measurements. We applied the same virtual-­-observatory astrometric methodology as by Caballero <ref type="bibr">13</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II.</ref> Two of our pairs, shown in italics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref>, turned out to be optical systems (i.e., not physical binaries). As a result, we do not compute average ρ and θ values for them in  <ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26</ref> , and LP 731−076, an M4 V star at about only 11 pc <ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">27</ref> . In this case, our astrometric study showed deviations of 3.6 arcsec in ρ and 6.9 deg in θ in almost six decades, with different proper motions (especially in declination: BD−10 3166: −181.1±3.0, −5.2±1.8 mas yr -­-1 ; LP 731−076: −187.7±3.9, −77.2±0.9 mas yr -­-1 ).</p><p>The case of the system WDS 07397+3328 (LDS 3755) is so pure chance that it deserves a comic strip <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The primary is G 090−016 (M2.0 V), which at the POSS-­-I epoch <ref type="bibr">(1955 February)</ref> was aligned with a background star, and the secondary is LP 256−44, which today is now aligned with the same background star.</p><p>We  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II</ref>, the constancy of the ten astrometric epochs between 1953 December and 2012 December led us to conclude that Ross 439 A and B do form a common proper-­-motion pair separated by 35.73±0.16 arcsec (the Giclas' measure in 1964 <ref type="bibr">28</ref> is only listed in the WDS as being to the nearest degree and nearest arcsecond, so it is just an estimated value).</p><p>Two more pairs have components with discordant tabulated proper motions for primaries and secondaries. In one, WDS 12123+5429 (VYS 5) is a pair of two bright early red dwarfs: BD+55 1519A (M0.0 V) and BD+55 1519B (M3.0 V). In the other, WDS 23294+4128 <ref type="bibr">(GIC 193</ref>) is composed of G 190−28 (M3.5 V) and G 190−27 AB (M4.0 V+m5: V). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table III</ref>, some tabulated proper motions were incorrect (LSPM's for VYS 5, USNO-­-B1 and PPMXL's for GIC 193), while the two pairs actually move together through space.</p><p>The remaining dubious pairs for which we confirmed the constancy of their angular separations and position angles and, therefore, their common proper motions with an astrometric study were WDS 03398+3328, WDS 20446+0854, and WDS 22058+6539. They will be discussed next.</p><p>FIG. 2 Sketch explaining the apparent "triple" system WDS 07397+3328, formed by a physical binary of bright and faint stars (solid lines) moving to the southwest and a (fixed) background star of intermediate brightness (dashed lines).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For (i.e., from F0 to K3), for which we took spectral types from the Simbad database 37−41 . There were also four systems containing white dwarfs, which are described below. Spectral typing was not available for four wide faint secondaries: LP 197−48 (WDS 02457+4456 B), PM I03510+1413 B (WDS 03510+1414 B), LP 256−44 (WDS 07397+3328 B), and G 264−18 B (WDS 22058+6539 B). For these, we estimated spectral types in the intervals m5: V to m7: V based on magnitude differences with respect to the primaries and a J-­-band absolute magnitude−spectral-­-type relation for M dwarfs <ref type="bibr">42</ref> (we write 'm' instead of 'M' for spectral types derived from photometry). Of these, only PM I03510+1413 B had another photometric spectral-­-type estimation (m5 V 43 , identical to ours  <ref type="bibr">47</ref> .

They were computed from the relationship (M1 + M2) P 2 = a2 3 (in convenient units), where a = a1 + a2, M1 a1 = M2 a2 and the semi-­-major axis a was replaced by the projected physical separation s. Calculated reduced periods range from slightly over one century to several millenia. Reduced periods match actual ones to within a factor of three, depending on actual eccentricity 52 . vi. Reduced binding</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">energies 13 , −Ug*. We used Ug* = −G M1 M2 s -­1</formula><p>, where again the actual physical separation r, which can be approximated by a at low eccentricities, was replaced by s. In the case of wide multiple systems with very long orbital periods, of over one thousand years, for which it is very hard (if not impossible) to determine orbits and semi-­-major axes, −Ug* allows easy comparison of binding energies of systems published by different authors <ref type="bibr">53</ref>  <ref type="bibr">51</ref> ). Interestingly, the system including EGGR 52 AB may be triple (see below). Although the white dwarfs are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref> (and in WDS) as secondaries because they are fainter in the optical and near-­-infrared than the M dwarfs, they are more massive <ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">55,</ref><ref type="bibr">56</ref> . Furthermore, masses of the main-­-sequence stars that evolved into the white dwarfs were in all cases above one solar mass.  <ref type="bibr">57</ref> ) and that there may exist a dynamical evolution associated with the remnant progenitor evolution (i.e., an increase of the physical separation when the star quits the main sequence and loses mass). Hierarchical triple and quadruple systems As shown in  <ref type="bibr">59</ref> , which is the brightest component of a 62-­-yr astrometric double, which in turn has a wide, proper-­-motion, M-­-dwarf companion of lower mass imaged with TCP. As a result, this system has an interesting architecture of consecutive 'pairs' of stars separated by ~0.16, 18.9, and 1770 AU. Perhaps not by chance, both the WDS 21148+3803 and WDS 08427+0935 quadruples are, with over 2 M  , the most massive of our systems. The other quadruple system in our sample, of slightly over 1 M  , is WDS 12576+3514.  <ref type="bibr">48</ref> . However, although tertiary companions tend to have masses comparable to the components of the inner binary, we find that the fraction of triple systems where the outer companion has the smallest mass is significantly larger than previously measured (about two thirds, in comparison with 46% measured by Tokovinin 48 ). Besides, systems with large ρwide/ρclose ratios are expected to be in stable configurations; however, the compact systems with low ρwide/ρclose ratios, such as WDS 19539+4425 (GIC 159 + MCY 3) and WDS 22173−0847 (LDS 182 + BEU 22), may deserve further study of long-­-term dynamical stability, spin alignment, or possible orbital evolution. These studies may be also extended to the hierarchical quadruple system WDS 08427+0935 (LUY 6218 + ST 8  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table    VII</ref> we list ten systems with the shortest reduced periods, of less than 1000 yr in all cases but one, and the largest θ variations (Δθ/360), of up to over 50% of their orbits. Because of non-­-zero eccentricity, these fractions of orbit in position angle do not translate linearly into fractions of orbit in reduced period (Δt/P*). In general, systems with larger/shorter fraction of orbit in θ than in P* were observed close to their periapses/apoapses.

  G 
  78−3: 
  +276.4±3.6, 
  −167.8±2.7

The 
  simplest 
  explanation 
  for 
  these 
  observables 
  is 
  that 
  G 
  78−3 
  is 
  in 
  the 
  foreground 
at an estimated distance of 13.6±1.1 pc, while G 78−4 is located further at 23.1±1.2 
pc. However, the latter forms the true common proper-­-motion pair WDS 
02457+4456 AC (LDS 5393) together with the ultracool dwarf LP 197−48 (see 
below). To sum up, WDS 02457+4456 is not a triple system, but only a double one. 
However, 
  and 
  quite 
  interestingly, 
  G 
  78−4 
  and 
  G 
  78−3 
  are, 
  with 
  angular 
  separation 

only about 1.5 arcmin, the closest unrelated M dwarfs in the CARMENES input 
catalogue 6 . 

The other viusal binary is WDS 10585−1046 (LDS 4041), which is formed 
by 
  BD−10 
  3166, 
  a 
  super-­-metal-­-rich 
  K0

  star 
  at 
  64−80

  The

discussion.

  composed 
  of 
  τ 
  Cyg 
  AB 
  and 
  τ 
  Cyg 
  Cab, 
  is 
  one 
  of 
  the 
only three quadruples in our sample. It was thought to be a quintuple because of a 
low-­-metallicity, low-­-mass, esdK-­-type star companion candidate at about 534 
arcsec 
  to 
  the 
  primary 
  and 
  out

  the 
  IAC80 
  field 
  of 
  view, 
  namely 
  LSR 
  J2115+3804 
(LEP 100 I 61 ). A simple astrometric analysis discards it as a physical quintuple 
system because of the different proper motions (Cortés-­-Contreras, in prep.). 
Besides, Daley's companion candidate to τ Cyg AB, DAL 38 G 62 , is also a 
background star according to PPMXL data.

As 
  previously 
  noticed, 
  since 
  our 
  initial 
  sample 
  of 
  106 
  observing 
  fields 
  was 
  biased 
towards multiple systems, it would be incorrect to derive here a frequency of 
binaries. 
  However, 
  we 
  can 
  get 
  some 
  reliable 
  statistics 
  on 
  the 
  minimum 
  frequency 
of higher-­-order multiples since there was no a priori bias towards them in our 
sample. There are at least 11 triples and three quadruples among our list of 52 
physical systems 
  studied 
  (there 
  can 
  be 
  still 
  unknown 
  close 
  binaries 
  or 
  very 
  wide 
proper-­-motion companions awaiting discovery), which results in minimum 
frequencies of triples and quadruples among multiple systems with M dwarf 
components of 21 +11 -­-8% and 6 +5 -­-4% (i.e., roughly one out of five 'binaries' is 
actually 
  a 
  triple, 
  and 
  roughly 
  one 
  out 
  of 
  17 
  'binaries' 
  is 
  actually 
  a 
  quadruple). 
  The 
non-­-detection of quintuples (or higher order) points to a frequency of them among 
multiple systems with M-­-dwarf components of less than 1.9%. For comparison, see 
Tokovinin 48 for frequency and statistics of triple and quadruple systems among 
multiple systems at all stellar masses.

  of

  are 
  the 
  M-­-dwarf−white-­-dwarf

  WDS

  WDS 
  13484+2337, 
  whose 
  actual 
  binding 
  energies 
  depend 
  closely 
  on 
  a 
  better 
estimation of the white-­-dwarf masses. The other three fragile systems are 
composed 
  of 
  M 
  dwarfs 
  only: 
  WDS 
  05033+2125 
  (which 
  is 
  actually 
  a 
  triple 
  system), 
WDS 20555−1400, and WDS 21440+1705. The five of them have parallactic 
distance measurements and projected physical separations between 1000 and 
4600 AU, approximately; there are other systems in our sample with similar 
projected 
  physical 
  separations 
  but 
  larger 
  binding 
  energies 
  because 
  of 
  their 
  larger 
(product 
  of) 
  mass. 
  WDS 
  21440+1705 
  could 
  be 
  even 
  more 
  fragile 
  than 
  tabulated 
  if 
the secondary were later than M4.5 V (see below, the 
five systems can survive in the Galactic disc for amounts of time comparable to the 
age of the Universe. 


Binaries with periods shorter than one millenium 

We looked for extra publicly-­-available 
  data 
  on 
  the 
  pairs 
  with 
  the 
  shortest 
  orbital 
periods. Our typical astrometry baseline coverage was of 60 yr (e.g., since the 
USNO-­-A2 
  epoch 
  of 
  the 
  first 
  Palomar 
  Observatory 
  Sky 
  Survey 
  in 
  the 
  early 
  1950s 
  to 
our 
  recent 
  epoch 
  of 
  IAC80 
  data). 
  In 
  some 
  cases, 
  when 
  the 
  Astrographic 
  Catalogue 
AC2000.2 78 or very old WDS data were available, coverage was longer than one 
century. Within this time span, some systems, especially those with the shortest 
periods, 
  displayed 
  appreciable 
  variations 
  of 
  position 
  angle.

Remarks 
00137+8038 (LDS 1503) ... 
00164+1950 (LDS 
  863) 
  During 
  the 
  late 
  1990s 
  and 
  early 
  2000s, 
  the 
  primary 
  of 
  the 
  binary 
  system 
  passed, 
from the observer's point of view, at only about 5 arcsec, by a Sun-­-like background star of null 
proper 
  motion 
  and 
  similar 
  brightness. 
  This 
  fact 
  led 
  Simbad 
  and 
  some 
  authors 
  to 
  mix 
  up 
  the 
coordinates 
  of 
  the 
  two 
  stars. 
  In 
  2014 
  and 
  onwards, 
  the 
  primary 
  of 
  the 
  true 
  binary 
  system 
  is 
the southern star of the visual trio. 
00184+4401 (GRB 34) Pair with period shorter than one millenium and appreciable orbital variation. 
01119+0455 (GIC 20) ... 
02361+0653 (PLQ 32 + GKI 1) Triple system (primary is a close double). 
02457+4456 (LDS 5393) False triple, actual double system with astrometric follow-­-up; true secondary 
with estimated spectral type at m6:V. 
02565+5526 (LDS 5401) … 
03242+2347 (LDS 884 + WOR 4) Triple system (primary is an active, close double). 
03398+3328 (ES 
  327) Pair 
  made 
  of 
  two 
  Henry 
  Draper 
  stars 
  of 
  relatively 
  low 
  proper 
  motion 
  that 
  needed 
astrometric follow-­-up. Several different spectral types have been proposed for the primary in 
the interval from K2IV to K5V 37,85,86 ; 
  its Hipparcos 
  distance 
  (43±3 
  pc) 
  is 
  significantly larger 
than the spectro-­-photometric 
  distance 
  to 
  the 
  secondary 
  provided 
  by 
  Riaz et al. 87 (29 
  pc) 
  or 
estimated 
  by 
  us 
  with 
  our 
  custom-­-made 
  SpT-­-MJ 
  relation 
  (21 
  pc). 
  We 
  may 
  need 
  the 
  ESA 
  Gaia 
space mission and/or a detailed spectroscopic analysis to understand what is wrong with this 
system (age, </table></figure>
