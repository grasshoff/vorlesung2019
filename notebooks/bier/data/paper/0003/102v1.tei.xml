			<abstract>
				<p>We present a conceptual design for a space based Galactic Exo-planet Survey Telescope (GEST) which will use the gravitational microlensing technique to detect extra solar planets with masses as low as that of Mars at all separations ∼ &gt; 1 AU. The microlensing data would be collected by a diffraction limited, wide field imaging telescope of ∼ 1.5 m aperture equipped with a large array of red-optimized CCD detectors. Such a system would be able to monitor ∼ 2 × 10 8 stars in ∼ 6 square degrees of the Galactic bulge at intervals of 20-30 minutes, and it would observe ∼ 12000 microlensing events in three bulge seasons. If planetary systems like our own are common, GEST should be able to detect ∼ 5000 planets over a 2.5 year lifetime. If gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are rare, then GEST would detect ∼ 1300 planets in a 2.5 year mission if we assume that most planetary systems are dominated by planets of about Nep-tune&apos;s&apos; mass. Such a mission would also discover ∼ 100 planets of an Earth mass or smaller if such planets are common. This is a factor of ∼ 50 better than the most ambitious ground based programs that have been proposed. GEST will also be sensitive to planets which have been separated from their parent stars. 1. Microlensing Planet Detection: GEST&apos;s Main Goal The main strength of the gravitational microlensing planet search technique is that it is sensitive to lower mass planets than other techniques. Observed from space, signals for planets down to the mass of Mars are detectable, but they are much rarer and have a shorter duration than higher mass planetary signals. Thus, a large number of stars must be followed with a high sampling frequency in order to detect low mass planets. With GEST, we are able to monitor ∼ 2 × 10 8 stars once every 30 minutes or so with a photometric accuracy of ∼ 1 %. The microlensing event will not repeat, so high quality photometric data must be obtained while the event is in progress. Our proposed GEST mission will accomplish this. The planetary systems studied by the microlensing technique are located 1 − 8 kpc away towards the Galactic center rather than in the local neighborhood. The planetary signals will usually be detected as a modifications of the single lens light curve due to the gravitational effect of the planet. Microlensing is most sensitive to planets near the Einstein ring radius which corresponds to a distance of 1 − 10 AU from the lens star, but because GEST does not require the discovery of stellar microlensing event to begin intensive monitoring for planets, GEST will be able to detect planets at arbitrarily 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Required Features of the Satellite Design</head><p>The main challenge for a microlensing search for low mass planets is that, although the planetary signals can be strong, they are both very rare and and have durations as short as ∼ 2 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Mao &amp; Paczynski 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Gould &amp; Loeb 1992)</ref>. Furthermore, the relatively large angular size of giant source stars makes them poor targets for a low mass microlensing planet search project as finite source effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bennett &amp; Rhie 1996)</ref> tend to wash out the microlensing signal. Thus, GEST must be able to monitor large areas of sky rapidly while attaining ∼ 1% photometry on main sequence source stars. In the central Galactic bulge fields where the microlensing rate is highest, ground based images are seriously incomplete at or above the bulge main sequence turn-off, so there is a great advantage to be gained from higher resolution imaging from space which will allow many of the main sequence stars to be separately resolved. Since areas of high star density must be observed, we need high angular resolution to maintain photometric accuracy. So, we are led to a requirement of a large field of view and a high angular resolution-for a very large number of CCD pixels. Our baseline design calls for a ∼ 1 square degree field of view with pixels of 0.1" or smaller, for a total of ∼ &gt; 1.3 × 10 9 pixels. Our suggested observing strategy will be to cycle over 4-6 selected fields near the Galactic center every 20-30 minutes. Given the high data rate implied by this strategy, a geosynchronous orbit seems sensible.</p><p>Our selected Galactic bulge fields fields have high reddening, so it is advantageous to observe at long wavelengths. Fortunately, recent developments in CCD technology have produced devices with a quantum efficiency of ∼ &gt; 80% at 750-950nm ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Groom et al 2000)</ref>. This is ∼ 4 times better than the CCD's used by HST's WFPC2 camera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Simulation of the GEST Mission</head><p>We have carried out a detailed simulation of the expected performance of the GEST mission. Here are the relevant features of our simulation: We assume that 6 square degrees of the Galactic bulge are observed once every 27 minutes. Photometry is assumed to be done using a difference imaging technique which is photon noise limited with a 0.3% systematic error added in quadrature. The photon noise is due to the target star and also any neighboring stars which have a PSF that overlaps with the target star. The effect of the neighboring stars was taken into account by constructing an artificial image with a resolution of 0.16" (the diffraction limit for a 1.5m telescope at λ = 900 nm). We assume a signal to noise of 60 for a source with I = 22, or about 16 detected photo-electrons per second for a 225 sec exposure. This estimate assumes the use of high sensitivity CCD's and a broad passband of 750-950nm.</p><p>We assume that the luminosity function found by Holtzman et al. (1998) for Baade's window applies to the entire 6 square degrees. This is conservative in that most of our fields will be closer to the Galactic Center with a higher star density, but this will be partially compensated for by the higher reddening in these fields. We conservatively assume a microlensing optical depth of τ = 3 × 10 −6 which is slightly below the measured values ( <ref type="bibr">Udalski et al, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alcock et al 1997)</ref>, and we assume the event timescale distribution given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alcock et al. (2000)</ref> as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">GEST Simulation Results</head><p>Our simulated GEST mission observes a total of 18,000 microlensing events with peak magnification &gt; 1.34 for source stars down to I = 24.5 over an assumed 3 year mission which observes the Galactic bulge for 8 months per year. Our detection threshold is a cut on ∆χ 2 which is the χ 2 difference between a single lens and planetary binary lens fit. We've simulated planetary microlensing lightcurves for planets at a range of separations ranging from 0.7 − 30(M star /M ⊙ )AU, and the left hand panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the number of detected planets if each lens system has a planet of the assumed mass fraction (ǫ) at the assumed separation. The right hand panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the number of detected "isolated" planets as a function of the planetary mass fraction, ǫ, which is now compared to the average stellar mass. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> indicates that we'll be able to detect 50-100 Earth mass planets if they are common at distances of a few AU or more, and 10-20 Earth mass planets if they are common at 1 AU. We also expect to detect ∼ 10 Mars mass planets if they are common at a few AU. The right panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the distribution of low mass planet detections as a function of our signal-to-noise parameter ∆χ 2 , and it indicates that most of the detections are well above our nominal detection threshold of ∆χ 2 = 160. Examples of simulated GEST low mass planetary lightcurves are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3-7</ref>.</p><p>For more massive planets, our sensitivity is much better. For solar system analogs, our simulations indicate that GEST would detect ∼ 5000 gas giant planets if our solar system is typical. If the typical planetary system resembles the solar system with Saturn and Jupiter replaced by Neptune mass planets, then GEST would detect ∼ 1300 of these Neptune-like planets. The left panel shows the number of potential planetary detections plotted as a function of planetary mass fraction and separation for a selection criteria of ∆χ 2 ≥ 160 for the GEST (upper thicker lines), and the VST (lower lines) surveys. This plot is normalized to the expected number of GEST planetary discoveries assuming every planetary system has a planet of the given mass fraction at the given separation. The right panel shows the number of isolated planet detections as a function of the planetary mass fraction (ǫ) under the assumption that there is one isolated planet for every star in the Galaxy. The simulated data for two Earth mass ratio (planetary mass fraction ǫ = 3 × 10 −6 ) planets with planet-star separations of a = 0.77 and a = 0.93 Einstein ring radii, respectively. The top panels show the simulated data for each event, and the region of the planetary deviation is indicated with the green box. The lower panel shows a blow-up of the planetary deviation region along with the planetary lensing lightcurve and the best fit standard single lens lightcurve (in cyan). The lightcurve on the left is a high signalto-noise detection with ∆χ 2 = 4100 while the lightcurve on the right is a detection just above our signal-to-noise cut at ∆χ 2 &gt; 160. Simulated data for two planetary microlensing events. The event on the left has a mass fraction of ǫ = 10 −6 and a separation of a = 1.43, and the event on the right has ǫ = 3 × 10 −7 and a = 1.30. These represent a Mars mass planet (for a typical M star ∼ 0.3M ⊙ ) and a Mars mass ratio planet, respectively. These events have ∆χ 2 = 7800 and ∆χ 2 = 200, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Comparison to Ground Based Surveys and Conclusions</head><p>In addition to detecting the planetary perturbation to the microlensing lightcurve, it is also important to determine the characteristics of the planet that has been detected. Microlensing generally allows the determination of the planetary mass fraction, ǫ, and the transverse separation of the planet from the lens star in units of the Einstein radius which is typically about 3(M star /M ⊙ )AU. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Gaudi and Gould (1997)</ref> have shown that these parameters can be accurately determined if the lightcurve deviations are well sampled. For caustic crossing planetary microlensing events which comprise a large fraction of the low mass planet detections, it is also possible to determine the planetary mass to about a factor of 2 or 3.</p><p>The gravitational microlensing planet search technique has previously been been considered for ground based observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Peale 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sackett 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Rhie et al 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albrow et al 2000)</ref>, but ground based surveys face some difficulties due to the requirement of continuous lightcurve monitoring. This can be accomplished with a network of microlensing follow-up telescopes spanning the globe at southern latitudes, but this requires that the survey rely upon observing sites that often have poor weather or seeing conditions. Sackett (1997) has argued that a dedicated 2.5m telescope like the VST with a wide field camera at an excellent site like Paranal could efficiently search for low mass planets where the deviations are expected to last only a few hours. We have done a simulation of such a survey (optimistically) assuming observations in consistent 0.7" seeing for 8 hours every night for 3 bulge seasons, and we find that low mass planets are not easily detected by such a ground based survey because the highest signal-to-noise events generally last longer than a few hours. If we demand that more than 90% of the ∆χ 2 signal occur in the 8 hour observing window for an event to have measurable parameters, then we find that this "VST" survey is 30-50 times less sensitive to low  The most significant detection "fully sampled" Earth mass fraction planet detection from the simulated VST survey is compared with the same event as seen in the GEST simulation. The separation is a = 1.31 and the detection signal strengths are ∆χ 2 = 39000 and ∆χ 2 = 5400 for the GEST and VST simulations, respectively. Note that despite passing our criteria, the VST data does not fully sample the planetary deviation. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. A large amplitude planetary signal due to a ǫ = 3 × 10 −6 , a = 2.47 planet is seen in a low magnification stellar microlensing event for the GEST simulation, but both lensing event is entirely missed in the VST simulation. mass planets than GEST as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Also, even the "best" planet detection in the VST survey misses a significant part of the planetary deviation as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  6</ref>. A study by Peale (1997) of a ground based microlensing planet search program with follow-up telescopes in Chile, Australia, and South Africa, also only manages a handful of low mass planet detections after eight years of observations and is not sensitive to isolated or Mars mass planets. So, the proposed GEST mission is ∼ &gt; 50 times more sensitive to low mass planets than both types of propsed ground based surveys.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
