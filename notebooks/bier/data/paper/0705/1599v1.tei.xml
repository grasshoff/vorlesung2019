				<p>Following an old idea of Fritz Zwicky, we make an attempt to establish a &quot;universal&quot; mass function for astronomical objects on all scales. The object classes considered are: solar system planets and small bodies, exoplanets, brown dwarfs, stars and stellar remnants, open and globular clusters, molecular clouds, galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. For comparison we also include CDM halos taken from numerical simulations. We show that the mass functions of individual object classes, when properly normalized, can indeed be concatenated to build a surprisingly continuous mass function of the universe, from M ≈ 10 −20 M ⊙ (sub-kilometer size asteroids) up to M ≈ 10 16 M ⊙ (rich clusters of galaxies), covering 36 orders of magnitude in mass. Most individual mass functions roughly follow a power law of the form φ(M) ∝ M −2. A notable exception are planets and small bodies which seem to obey a flatter distribution. CDM halos from high-resolution numerical simulations show a very similar relation, again of &quot;universal slope&quot; −2, from clusters of galaxies all the way down to the planetary mass scale. On the scale of stars and star clusters this is a remarkable coincidence, as the formation processes involved are thought to be totally different (bottom-up gravitational clustering of DM halos versus top-down gravoturbulent fragmentation of gas clouds).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>There is a great variety of astronomical objects in the universe -by increasing average size or mass: asteroids, planets, brown dwarfs, stars and stellar remnants, binary and multiple stars, star clusters, molecular clouds, galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies. Each of these classes of objects follows a certain (but generally not well known) distribution function in size, luminosity, or mass. The most fundamental characteristic property of all these distribution functions is that smaller or less massive things of a given kind are more abundant than larger or more massive ones. Presumably the same would hold not only within a certain class of objects, but also if one were to glue together the individual distribution functions to build a "universal" distribution function, as there would be, per unit volume of space, more asteroids than planets, more planets than stars, more stars than galaxies, etc.</p><p>In this paper we are doing just that: putting together all known distribution functions for different object classes to see whether there is such a thing like a "universal distribution function". -"Universality" has a twofold meaning here: We can ask (1) whether the all-object distribution function is sufficiently continuous to render the notion of universality useful in the first place, and (2) if yes, whether the slope of the individual distribution functions and that of the grand total is, to a certain degree, universally the same. For the present study we choose mass as the independent parameter, as mass is probably the most fundamental -albeit difficult to determine -property of an astronomical object (luminosity is inappropriate because there are dark objects). We show that by proper normalization we can indeed establish a continuous mass function of the universe from 10 −20 M ⊙ (100 meter-size asteroids) to at least 10 16 M ⊙ (the most massive clusters of galaxies), and that there is surprising similarity in the slope of the mass function over a large range of mass.</p><p>The question of a universal distribution function of astronomical objects has apparently been of interest only to Fritz Zwicky. In his 1942 Physical Review paper entitled "On the large scale distribution of matter in the universe", Zwicky argued on purely theoretical grounds that the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies had to be essentially exponential, i.e. ever fainter galaxies being increasingly more numerous, just as observed today (see below) -but in contradiction with the data available then, which showed a more Gaussian-type LF for galaxies. Zwicky's vision was that galaxies constitute an ensemble of "particles" in a stationary state of statistical equilibrium. Frequent close encounters would dissolve larger aggregates of galaxies on the one hand, and accumulate new ones on the other hand, resulting in a Boltzman-type energy distribution for galaxies and groups and clusters of galaxies as a whole. Today, we know that the temperature and density of the "galaxy gas" is much too small, and thus the time-scale of galaxy interactions much too long, for a statistical equilibrium to be established or maintained. But Zwicky was perfectly right not only in his prediction of an exponential LF (which he himself set out to prove, see <ref type="bibr">Zwicky 1957, p. 220ff</ref>), but also in his view that galaxian systems, from dwarf galaxies up to the richest clusters of galaxies, follow one, continuous distribution function (which was observationally established for the first time by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahcall 1979</ref>, see also below). This unity of objects on the scale of galaxies and systems of galaxies is now understood in terms of a general, cosmological "bottom-up scenario" centred around the hierarchical, gravitational clustering of dark halos in an expanding universe having formed from primordial density fluctuations, as, e.g., described by the "PressSchechter formalism" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Press &amp; Schechter 1974)</ref>.</p><p>While Zwicky considered stars in his 1942 paper as well, he was well aware that the mass distribution of stars must be shaped by totally different physical processes. Put in simple terms, the relation between stars and (small) galaxies is plausibly one of gas fragmentation (from large to small), rather than clustering (from small to large). So why should there be a universal mass function, if there can hardly be universal (global) physics behind the frequency distribution of such things like asteroids, stars, and galaxy clusters? This must be the reason why the question of a universal mass distribution (beyond the scale of galaxies and systems of galaxies) has never been taken up since Zwicky; it simply does not seem to make much sense from a physical point of view.</p><p>Conversely, the -surprising -degree of universality in the mass distribution of astronomical objects found in the present paper does not entitle us to conclude that there indeed is overarching physics at work, though this cannot be excluded either. While we will, in the discussion section, briefly indulge in speculations on what it all could mean, we emphasize that our primary goal is not to find a sort of cosmological principle that governs the mass distribution function of the universe, but to provide a valuable piece of cosmography. A good knowledge of the frequency distribution of things in the universe is an end in itself.</p><p>There are conceptual difficulties with the definition of an astronomical object. What exactly is an astronomical object, i.e. what kind of objects should we include in such a study? The most simple requirement would be that such an object is gravitationally bound. However, sub-kilometer asteroids (let alone dust particles, if we were to push the distribution function to the extremes) are hold together by non-gravitational forces. Also, on large scales, where gravity does dominate, we wish, for the sake of continuity, to include molecular clouds which are in general unbound but are identifiable entities none the less.</p><p>Each class of objects has its own specific technical difficulties in the establishment of a distribution function. There is a rich history of attempts, e.g., to determine the stellar LF (and thus the initial mass function, IMF), or the LF and mass-tolight (M/L) ratio of galaxies. The present paper is not meant to be a meta-study where all these attempts for the different object classes are critically assessed. Rather, we will take "reasonable" distribution functions from the recent literature, with no consideration of the uncertainties, and put them together to construct a first-guess universal mass function. These distribution functions will partially overlap in mass and partially be separated by gaps in mass regions where we lack objects or data.</p><p>Another principal difficulty of such a study is the normalization. Everything has to be normalized to the same volume of space, but our objects are sampled in vastly different volumes: While clusters of galaxies are seen over a significant part of the observable universe, and the galaxian LF, though sampled in a fairly local volume, can still be regarded as universal, the stellar LF is simply that of the solar neighbourhood, and the mass function of planets and small bodies is entirely drawn from our solar system (never mind the exponentially growing number of -nearby -exoplanets). So the smaller the scale the larger and more uncertain the extrapolation to a universal mean. This kind of uncertainty will not soon go away. Rather, we have to rely, as all of cosmology does, on the Cosmological Principle, i.e. that we are living in a typical, average environment -on all scales. All our mass functions will in the end be normalized to a volume of 1 Mpc <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and given in units of solar masses</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">([φ(M )] = Mpc −3 M ⊙ −1 ).</formula><p>The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the individual mass functions for the different object classes, starting with galaxies and going up first to supergalactic, then going down to subgalactic structures. These functions are put together to a universal mass function in section 3, where the mass distribution of dark matter halos from theory is added for comparison. Finally, in section 4 we discuss possible meanings of the universality found and give our conclusions. A Hubble constant of 70 km s −1 Mpc −1 is used throughout.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Galaxies</head><p>While the galaxian LF is fairly well known, except at the very faintest end, the mass function (hereafter MF) of galaxies is very hard to determine, as galaxies are dominated by non-baryonic dark matter (DM) of a principally unknown nature. The galaxian MF is reconstructed from individual or statistical mass-to-light-ratio determinations (or rather estimates!) that have to be convolved with the luminosity distribution which is usually taken to be a <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schechter (1976)</ref> function of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ(L)dL = φ * (L/L * ) α exp(−L/L * )dL .</formula><p>(1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vale &amp; Ostriker (2004)</ref> give the following mass-tolight function for galaxies:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L(M ) = A (M/M ′ ) b [c + (M/M ′ ) d k ] 1/k<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with the best-fitting parameters A = 5.7 × 10 9 , M ′ = 10 11 , b = 4, c = 0.57, d = 3.72, and k = 0.23. At the low-mass end this gives L ∝ M 4 , at the high-mass end L ∝ M 0.3 . A total galaxy MF is then obtained through</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ(M ) = dL(M ) dM φ(L(M ))<label>(3)</label></formula><p>by inserting (2) and the Schechter function (1) with parameters taken from the 2dF galaxy LF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Norberg et al. 2002)</ref>, as used also by <ref type="bibr">Vale &amp; Os- triker (2004)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">φ * = 5.52 × 10 −3 Mpc −3 L −1 ⊙ , L * = 2.31 × 10 10 L ⊙ (in the B band)</formula><p>, and α = −1.21. However, we use this Vale &amp; Ostriker galaxy MF only for galaxy masses smaller than 10 11 M ⊙ , as the high-mass end (with its shallow slope, see above) would produce too many cD-type galaxies (as Vale and Ostriker note, the cD halos that went into their mass-to-light function are rather hosting the whole cluster than the cD alone). A more appropriate MF at the high-mass end may be provided by van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Bosch et al. (2005)</ref> who work with the statistical distribution of satellite galaxies. Their mass-to-light function is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L(M ) = 2M (M/L) 0 [(M/M 1 ) −γ1 + (M/M 2 ) γ2 ]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>with the best-fitting parameters (M/L) 0 = 115, log M 1 = 10.76, log M 2 = 12.15, γ1 = 2.92 and γ2 = 0.29 (for a ΛCDM clustering normalization of σ 8 = 0.9). This is somewhat steeper at the high-mass end (L ∝ M 0.7 versus M 0.3 ), giving a total MF that is falling down more rapidly now with increasing mass, while it is roughly compatible with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vale &amp; Ostriker (2004)</ref> at the low-mass end. We therefore use the resulting van den Bosch et al. MF for galaxies with masses larger than 10 11 M ⊙ , keeping however the Vale &amp; Ostriker MF for smaller masses, with continuity at M = 10 11 M ⊙ . This total (DM-dominated) galaxy MF, as a combination of the two functions for larger and smaller masses as just described, is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The universal <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.-Total and baryonic mass functions of galaxies.</p><p>normalization (per Mpc 3 ) is of course provided by the adopted normalized LF. For comparison we also show the baryonic MF of galaxies in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> (stars, stellar remnants, atomic and molecular gas), taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Read &amp; Trentham (2005)</ref>. It is based on a host of NIR broad-band as well as radio observations and is given in the form of a Schechter mass function <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> with parameters φ * = 2.5 × 10 −14 Mpc −3 M ⊙ −1 , M * = 1.31 × 10 11 M ⊙ , and α = −1.21. The baryonic galaxy mass is indeed dominated by stars; the Schechter α is the same (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Read &amp; Trentham 2005</ref> for a detailed account of the contribution by the gas). We show the galaxy MFs down to a mass of 10 6 M ⊙ ; this is of course a bold extrapolation; the faint end of the LF, let alone the MF of galaxies, is not well constrained.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">φ(M )dM = φ * (M/M * ) α exp(−M/M * )dM</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Groups and Clusters of Galaxies</head><p>The mass of groups and clusters of galaxies is dominated by DM as well and has to be estimated either from the kinematics of member galaxies or (for clusters only) from the X-ray intracluster gas properties or the gravitational lensing of background galaxies. There are several stud- <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.-The mass function of groups and clusters of galaxies ies of the group and cluster MF in the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahcall &amp; Cen 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Biviano et al. 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, Girardi et al. 1998</ref>). For our purposes we take the MF of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Girardi et al. (1998)</ref> which is based on optical virial mass estimates of a complete sample of 152 nearby clusters. It was derived only for masses larger than a few 10 14 M ⊙ , but we extrapolate it down to 10 12 M ⊙ , because it is compatible with the MF of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahcall &amp; Cen (1993)</ref> which does cover also the low-mass end by including small groups. The adopted MF for groups and clusters, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, is a Schechter-type MF of the form (5), however fixing α = −1 (flat end), with φ * = 6.2 × 10 −20 Mpc −3 M ⊙ −1 , and M * = 3.7 × 10 14 M ⊙ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Star Clusters and Molecular Clouds</head><p>Next we consider subgalactic structures: star clusters and molecular clouds which can be as massive as extreme dwarf galaxies but in contrast to these do not contain dark matter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Globular clusters</head><p>The observed LF of globular clusters is typically bell-shaped (Gaussian). However, the decline towards fainter luminosities (masses) is probably an effect of dynamical evolution (dissolution of smaller clusters in the galactic tidal field) and may not reflect the initial distribution [for a different view, however, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Parmentier &amp; Gilmore 2007]</ref>. As suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Surdin (1979)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Racine (1980), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harris &amp; Pudritz (1994)</ref>, the initial mass distribution of globular clusters can be modelled by a power law of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">dN dM ∝ M −β (6)</formula><p>or in our MF notation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">φ(M )dM = AM −β dM .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Such a distribution is indeed observed for young clusters in merging galaxies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Whitmore &amp; Schweizer 1995)</ref>, and the high-mass tails of the old globular cluster systems of nearby galaxies are still following this form very closely. For globulars with masses larger than 10 5 M ⊙ , <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Harris &amp; Pudritz (1994)</ref> find a mean best-fitting β = 1.7, which we adopt for our globular cluster MF in the range 10 5 − 10 7 M ⊙ . For lower masses we consider only open clusters (see below). How can this MF now be normalized to a universal density? This is done by the "specific frequency"</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S N = 8.55 × 10 7 N T L V /L ⊙ ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>which is the number of globular clusters per "piece" of mother galaxy of absolute V magnitude −15. N T is the estimated total number of globular clusters. S N depends on the morphological type of the mother galaxy, but a reasonable mean value is S N = 3 (see Harris 2001), which we adopt. With a universal V luminosity density, ρ L , we have for the mean number of globular clusters per Mpc 3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A gc 10 7 M⊙ 10 5 M⊙ M −1.7 dM = S N [ρ L /L ⊙ ] 8.55 × 10 7 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Open Clusters</head><p>As shown, e.g., by Elmegreen &amp; Efremov (1997) from their study of hundreds of open clusters in the LMC, the LF of open clusters systematically depends on age. Using the same power law for the LF,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">φ(L)dL ∝ L −β dL ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>β is smaller (i.e. the LF more flattened) the younger the cluster. Very young clusters (age less than 10 7 years) have essentially a flat distribution (β ≈ 1); somewhat older clusters up to an age of 10 8 years show β ≈ 1.5, and for clusters older than 10 8 years we finally have β ≈ 2. The flat LFs found with young clusters is obviously due to the presence (and dominance, in terms of light) of short-lived OB stars. Clearly, then, for the mass distribution <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7)</ref> of open clusters, β = 2 is a reasonable choice. A normalization (fixing constant A in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(7)</ref>  </p><p>With A gc from above, this gives A oc = 1.89 × 10 5 Mpc −3 M ⊙ −1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Molecular Clouds</head><p>Although molecular clouds are not gravitationally bound and are not even in a state of longterm equilibrium, being formed and dispersed on a time-scale shorter than the dynamical timescale of the Galaxy, they are objects in the sense that one can measure their sizes and masses and thus determine a distribution function. Molecular clouds exhibit a fractal structure, i.e. smaller (and denser) clouds are embedded in larger ones. The cumulative size distribution for substructures inside a fractal is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">N (&gt; S) ∝ S −D ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>or in differential form</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">n(S)dS ∝ S −(D+1) dS ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where D is the fractal dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mandelbrot 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">see Elmegreen &amp; Falgarone 1996</ref>, whose formalism we follow here). On the other hand, there is a size-mass relation which can be assumed to be a power law again:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">M ∝ S κ .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>The size distribution can now be transformed into a mass distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">n(M )dM = n(S) dS dM dM ∝ M − D κ −1 dM .

This is consistent with another definition of the fractal dimension: <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mandelbrot 1982)</ref>, suggesting that the size and mass distribution of molecular clouds is, in fact, the result of fractal gas structure.

We note, as has been noted before, that the MFs of molecular clouds and star clusters (and, in fact, of stars as well, see below) have very similar power laws. Such would be a natural outcome, if stars and star clusters form(ed) by the fragmentation of turbulent cloud cores (e.g. Elmegreen &amp; Efremov 1997).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Stars and Stellar Remnants</head><p>In the spectrum of cosmic objects we would next have to deal with binary and (the much less frequent) multiple stars before coming to single stars. However, we are still lacking reliable binary statistics. A very rough estimate of the MF of binary stars is the following. Consider the extreme case that every star is in a system of two stars of equal mass. Then the mass function of binaries per unit volume would obviously be lowered in amplitude by at least a factor of two as compared to the MF of single stars, while otherwise being of similar shape and covering essentially the same mass range. This shows that in our first-guess universal mass function, binary and multiple star systems can be neglected.</p><p>In the following we will determine the MF of a universally averaged, evolved, present-day population of single stars and stellar remnants. Such a distribution function has never been discussed in the literature, precisely because it is interesting only in the present (new) context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">IMF and Final-to-Initial Mass Ratio</head><p>The mass function of single stars at their birth, i.e. the initial mass function (IMF), is an imortant datum for all of astronomy and is of course the backbone of our treatment. The original form given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Salpeter (1955)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">φ(M )dM ∝ M −2.35 dM<label>(18)</label></formula><p>is still in use for stars of higher mass. For lowmass stars various modifications of the Salpeter function have been suggested (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kroupa 2001)</ref>, but there is agreement that well below one solar mass the power-law index is around −1.8, rather than −2.35. For our purposes we adopt an index of −1.8 for masses smaller than 0.5 M ⊙ (down to M = 0.1 M ⊙ ), and the Salpeter index for stellar masses above that limit (up to M = 120 M ⊙ ). A second, even less well-known ingredient for our calculation is the relation between the initial mass of a star and the final mass of its remnant (white dwarf, neutron star, black hole). Stars with initial masses smaller than about 8 M ⊙ end up as white dwarfs; stars with initial masses above this critical limit end up as neutron stars or black holes. For the initial-mass range 1 to 7 M ⊙ and solar metallicity (which we assume here for simplicity) we adopt the final white dwarf masses given by Weidemann (2000, Table 2.1); they range from 0.55 M ⊙ for a 1 M ⊙ star initially, to 1.02 M ⊙ for a 7 M ⊙ star initially. For subsolar masses, where little is known about the initial-final mass ratio, we assume a simple linear relation from (M i /M f ) = (0.1, 0.1) to (1, 0.55). The exact relation is nearly irrelevant for our purposes because these stars do not evolve in a Hubble time, anyway.</p><p>For high-mass stars (M i &gt; 8 M ⊙ ) the situation is very complex, as the evolution and therefore also the mass loss of these stars strongly depends on metallicity and other parameters, such as rotation etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Woosley, Heger &amp; Weaver 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Heger et al. 2003</ref>). We have constructed an initial-final mass function for these stars, drawing on the information contained in the papers just mentioned, by extending the low-mass relation continuously with a linear relation from (M i /M f ) = (7, 1.02) up to (15, 1.4), and then again linearly from (15, 1.4) all the way up to <ref type="bibr">(120,</ref><ref type="bibr">25)</ref>. This is a very rough approximation (in lack of better knowledge) and we assume solar metallicity (metal-poor stars would suffer less mass loss, resulting in higher-mass remnants). The adopted initial-final mass function is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Stellar Lifetimes and Star Formation Histories</head><p>Two more ingredients for our calculation of the MF of stars and stellar remnants for an evolved stellar system are needed: the lifetime of a star as a function of its initial mass, and the star formation rate as a function of time (i.e. the star formation history). The stellar lifetime (which is essentially the time spent on the main sequence) is also a function of metallicity; for simplicity we again assume solar metallicity. A table with the stellar lifetimes for solar-metallicity stars with initial mass between 0.8 and 120 M ⊙ is given, e.g., in the textbook of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sparke &amp; Gallagher (2000)</ref>; for stars with mass below 0.8 M ⊙ the lifetime is larger than a Hubble time. We have fitted a polynomial of second degree to the tabulated pairs (log stellar mass, log lifetime) to get the estimated lifetimes for stars of any (non-tabulated) mass.</p><p>Three types of star formation histories have been used as input: (1) an initial burst of star formation, i.e. all stars are born at the same instant, approximately applying to elliptical and S0 galaxies, (2) a constant star formation rate, simulating the case of spiral and irregular galaxies, and (3) a "cosmic" star formation history. The latter is inferred from high-redshift observations and is usually given as star formation rate per unit volume as a function of redshift. We have adopted the log (SFR)-z relation of Madau, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pozzetti &amp; Dickinson (1998,</ref>  <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>) and turned it into a log (SFR)-t relation with the help of a "Cosmology Calculator" 1 using </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Mass Function of an Evolved Stellar Population</head><p>The present-day MF of stars and stellar remnants for an assumed star formation history is now calculated in the following way. The whole mass range from 0.1 to 120 M ⊙ is divided into bins of width 0.1 M ⊙ , giving 1 200 mass points. The evolutionary timespan considered is 12 Gyr, i.e. we assume that the first stars were built around 12 Gyr ago, in accord with the typical age of Milky Way globular clusters. Dividing this timespan into intervals of 0.1 Myr gives 12 000 timesteps. Consider now that we start with a star formation event.</p><p>The original mass function φ(M ) is then simply the adopted IMF. After every time step we compare the time elapsed since the birth event with the lifetime of a star of given mass. Stars with lifetimes smaller than the population age are instantly lost, i.e. taken away from the mass function at their initial mass and added at a different place of the mass function at their much smaller remnant (final) mass. In this way stars of subsequently smaller masses are lost from the population, leading to the well-known "burning down" of the IMF from high to low masses. Non-coeval stellar populations (constant SFR or cosmic SFH) can easily be calculated as superposition of many little bursts distributed over the whole timespan (one burst for a given population fraction at every timestep).</p><p>The resulting present-day MFs of stars and stellar remnants for the three different star formation histories considered are shown, along with the IMF, in Figs. 6 and 7. The MFs are normalized to the same integrated, initial stellar mass as contained in the IMF; the normalization of the IMF itself is arbitrary. The MF would in principle be unchanged, i.e. remain identical to the IMF, for masses somewhat smaller than 1 M ⊙ . However, we note a little spike on top of the IMF around log M = −0.2, or M ≈ 0.6 M ⊙ . This is due to the "graveyard" of white dwarfs of initial mass 1 M ⊙ or smaller. The depletion at masses larger than about 4 M ⊙ (log M &gt; 0.6) is independent of the star formation history -these are the black hole remnants of rapidly evolving highmass stars (initial mass larger than ca. 30 M ⊙ , see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 4</ref>). In the intermediate mass range of 1 to 4 M ⊙ we see the expected differences: the largest depletion of the MF at supersolar masses <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.-Present-day mass functions of stars and stellar remnants for a simple (co-eval) stellar population of age 12 Gyr ("initial burst", broken line), and a stellar population with a constant star formation rate (dotted). The IMF (full line) is shown for comparison. The staircase character is a result of the binning (see text). The normalization is arbitrary.</p><p>is found for the "initial burst" case (i.e. E and S0 galaxy stellar populations), the smallest depletion for constant star formation rate (spiral and irregular galaxy stellar populations), and the cosmic SFH case is lying somewhere between, as the two principal galaxy classes roughly contribute the same amount of stellar mass to the universal mean (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Read &amp; Trentham 2005</ref>). The (artificial) cutoff at log M ≈ 1.4 corresponds to the maximum final black-hole mass of ca. 25 M ⊙ originating from the initial-mass cut-off at 120 M ⊙ . As the high-mass end of the MF is entirely shaped by the very poorly constrained final-initial mass function <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 4</ref>), this part of the distribution function should not be taken at face value. Overall, from the viewpoint of a universal mass function of things, the present-day MF of stars and stellar remnants is not dramatically different from the stellar IMF; for subsolar masses it is essentially the same, for supersolar masses it is down in amplitude by roughly one order of magnitude. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Solar System</head><p>But even for the solar system we are far from having a complete census. The recent detection of several Pluto-sized objects in the Kuiper belt means that completeness of the solar system member census can be claimed only to about a mass of 10 −9 M ⊙ , or a diamter of 1 000 Km, which are roughly Pluto's values. Taking data from the latest edition of Allan's Astrophysical Quantities (Cox 2000) for planets, moons, and bright asteroids, and having turned the diameters of bright asteroids and of some "unweighted" moons into masses by assuming a reasonable mean mass density of 2 g cm −3 , we get a MF of solar system bodys as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> (indicated as crosses, giving numbers of objects per unit solar mass). This distribution can be fitted by a straight line representing a rather shallow power-law index of −0.96. As mentioned, below ≈ 10 −9 M ⊙ (Pluto's mass) this MF is bound to be incomplete. We construct a more reliable low-mass extension from faint asteroids, in the following way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ivezic et al.

The mass range covered extends from 10 −20 M ⊙ (corresponding to asteroids of D ≈ 0.3 km) up to 10 −13 M ⊙ (D ≈ 100 km). This is the MF adopted for our study, shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Lacking proper normalization, it is simply attached to the previously determined MF for planets, moons, and bright asteroids by extrapolating the steep, high-mass power law (γ ′ = 2) towards still higher masses, glueing the two distributions together at 10 −9 M ⊙ , the assumed limit of completeness for the planetary MF. By this we should more or less include the catalogued, brighter (larger, more massive) asteroids missed by the SDSS-based work of <ref type="bibr">Izevic et al.

Kuiper-belt (TransNeptunian) objects seem to follow a distribution similar to the asteroids (e.g., Bagatin 2005, <ref type="figure">Fig.  2)</ref>. By their exclusion, for lack of adequate data, we are likely underestimating the MF amplitude for small bodies, but probably not more than by a factor of 10, which is still not very relevant for our universal MF. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>.-Mass function of planets, satellites, and small bodies of the solar system in numbers per unit solar mass.

The full line at lower masses with a knee around 10 −16 M ⊙ (diameter ≈ 5 km) is the diameter-inferred mass function of SDSS asteroids.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Extrasolar Planets</head><p>The exploration of extrasolar planets has only just begun. What we have learned so far is that the maximum planetary mass seems to be around 10 Jupiter masses, or 1/100 of a solar masswhich happens to coincide roughly with the minimum mass of brown dwarfs (see above). Most exoplanets detected so far have -by necessity, given the detection techniques -masses in the narrow range of 1 to 10 Jupiters (in fact, these are minimum masses, due to the unknown inclination of the planetary orbits). So we can use the (minimum) mass distribution of the presently known exoplantes (around 200, as of late 2006) to extend the solar system MF towards 10 Jupiter masses. For this purpose we have collected data published in the web-based Interactive Extrasolar Planets Catalog of Jean Schneider 2 and glued the narrow mass distribution function directly to the high-mass end of the solar system MF (i.e. to Jupiter at 1/1000 of a solar mass); this is the dotted curve in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> indicated by "Exoplanets". Its exact form is irrelevant here, because it will change faster than we could publish it!</p></div>

For solar-type (G-type) stars the frequency of planetary systems is found to be in the 10 % range (e.g., Quirrenbach 2005, p.39). But the detection of extrasolar planets is still biased towards high masses and small periods; so that freqency could be significantly higher. On the other hand, the majority of stars are M dwarfs, for which planetary companions have yet to be discovered. The ubiquity of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars seems to suggest the ubiquity of planetary systems; but we do not yet know whether this is generally true. Nor do we have a clue whether the abundance of planetary and small bodies scales with the mass of the star, or whether the shape of the planetary MF is always the same, etc. So, for want of better knowledge we make a very simple (solarcentric) assumption: we assume that, on average in the universe, there is one solar system for every 10 solar masses (reproducing, of course, the 10 % frequency for G-type stars).

This is the distribution shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. It is apparent that the MFs of giant planets and brown dwarfs do not smoothly interconnect, but there is also no reason why they should. In fact, there seems to be a genuine frequency gap between the two types of objects (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>.-The normalized mass function of solar system bodies and exoplanets, along with the mass function of stars, stellar remnants and brown dwarfs. Notice the possible discontinuity between giant planets and brown dwarfs. <ref type="bibr">Quirrenbach 2005, p.40)</ref>. In any case, it should be borne in mind that this planet-star normalization is probably the most unreliable normalization of our whole study.</p></div>

It is gratifying that the two halves almost perfectly connect to each other around one solar mass. Remember that this normalization was achieved on the basis of the mean universal mass density carried by the stars, embodied in the galaxies on the one hand, and comprised by the stars themselves on the other. Before discussing the meaning of this and of the whole MF, we will in the following add one more piece of information: the MF of dark matter halos as derived from theory and numerical simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Mass Function of Dark Matter Halos</head><p>From Numerical Simulations A highly advanced theory of structure formation should one day be able to reproduce the observed universal MF. Of course, we are very far from having reached this point. However, on larger scales the basic agent of structure formation is the dissipationless gravitational clustering of matter, a process which is fairly well understood and is simulated, with ever increasing numerical resolution, since more than 30 years. In the con-text of a cold dark matter (CDM) scenario, starting with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, there is increasing fluctuation power with decreasing mass at recombination, getting asymptotically flat towards smaller masses (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Longair 1998, p. 316)</ref>. This means that CDM structure is forming first on small scales and is building up in a hierarchical way to ever larger scales. It is straightforward to show (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Longair 1998, p.373</ref>, see also below), by using the formalism of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Press &amp; Schechter (1974)</ref>, that the flat low-mass end of the fluctuation spectrum at recombination results in a power-law MF with slope −2 at small masses, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">φ(M ) DM dM ∝ M −2 dM .

The general form and low-mass slope of the DM mass function has been confirmed and strengthened by more recent semi-analytic work <ref type="bibr">(Sheth &amp; Thor- men (1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, see also Vale &amp; Ostriker 2004</ref>) and by numerous numerical simulations of the hierarchical collapse and clustering of DM halos (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Reed et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, Diemand, Moore &amp; Stadel (2005a) performed very-high-resolution numerical CDM simulations and found DM substructure right down to the theoretical limit at M ≈ 10 −6 M ⊙ , corresponding to the mass of planet Earth (!).

Moreover, in the mass range 10 10 − 10 15 M ⊙ the normalization (absolute number of halos per solar mass and cubic Mpc) of Diemand et al.'s simulation is only a factor of two different from the one given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Reed et al.

Above 10 15 M ⊙ the MF bends down in the usual "Schechter-Press" manner (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Reed et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, Vale &amp; Os- triker 2004</ref>; for this part of the MF we can directly rely on the cluster data. The resulting, very simple theoretical MF for DM halos is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 11</ref>, along with all other MFs shown already in <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>. Obviously, there is good match on the scale of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This had also to be expected, given the fact that, with respect to mass, DM is the major constituent of these structures. In adition, the normalization of the simulated MF is of course not independent but is drawn from observed quantities, such as the mean mass density of the universe and the density fluctuation amplitude encapsulated in σ 8 . For galaxies, however, we note a difference: the observed slope is flatter than the simulated slope. This means that the simulations predict more substructure on galactic scales than is actually observed, i.e. most DM minihalos seem to lack a baryonic (dwarf galaxy) counterpart. This discrepancy has manifested itself also as "satellite catastrophe" (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Moore at al. 1999</ref>). The relation of the mini/microhalos on still smaller scales to astronomical objects is addressed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Here is first a recapitulation of our main findings: (1) The mass functions of individual classes of astronomical objects can be concatenated to build a nearly continuous, "universal" mass function that stretches from small asteroids all the way up to the richest clusters of galaxies, covering 36 orders of magnitude in mass. (2) Most individual MFs follow, in part or entirely, a power law with index α ≈ −2. A notable exception is the MF of planetary and small bodies which is significantly flatter. As a consequence the combined MF from stars to clusters of galaxies shows a "universal" slope of α ≈ −2 as well. (3) CDM halos from numerical simulations follow a nearly identical MF, with α = −2, holding even at the scale of stars and planets. How should this be interpreted? What can be expected as a natural outcome of structure formation? What cannot, and is in need of a special explanation? Certainly the mass function(s) must somehow reflect the physical processes involved with the formation of these objects. Three different regimes of astronomical objects, known to have radically different formation histories, can be distinguished:</p><p>(1) Galaxies and supergalactic structures (from dwarf galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies) were formed by gravitational clustering in a bottomup manner. Their basic constituent is thought to be CDM, being clustered in underlying dark halos. These halos (according to the most recent simulations) have a rich substructure down to the scale of stars and planets. The standard formation scenario envisions the growth of primordial density fluctuations in CDM and the subsequent, hierarchical gravitational instability and collapse of CDM halos from the smallest (planetary) to the largest (galaxy cluster) scale. The M −2 mass distribution, which is roughly observed on the galactic and supergalactic scales and is implied by numerical simulations to hold for all scales, is in principle well understood as a consequence of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations, P (k) ∝ k n , and the "transfer function" describing the change of spectrum due to the damping of fluctuations in the prerecombination epoch, T (k) ∝ k n ′ in its most simple form. The resulting power spectrum at recombination is P rec (k) = P (k) · T (k) 2 = k n+2n ′ , and the low-mass end (k → ∞) of the mass function of DM halos at the present epoch becomes (as inferred, e.g., from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Efstathiou 1990, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Longair 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">φ DM ∝ M (n+2n ′ −9)/6 .<label>(25)</label></formula><p>With a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum (n = 1) and for adiabatic CDM fluctuations (n ′ = −2 in the limit for large k), this turns into the familiar M −2 law. Clearly, the primordial spectral index is not as important as the transfer function. So the M −2 behaviour can essentially be viewed as a property of CDM. Hot dark matter (HDM), e.g., would behave very differently -all fluctuations on large scales would get completely damped out and structure formation would (have to) turn into a top-down scenario.</p><p>(2) Stars and star clusters are believed to have formed by the gravoturbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds in a top-down manner. It has been noted before that the mass functions of stars, star clusters, and molecular cloud cores are quite similar. For stars we have the essentially still valid Salpeter IMF with power-law slope −2.35, star clusters have mass functions with slope ≈ −2 (see Sect. 2.3), and molecular gas clouds show a fractal structure with fractal dimension D ≈ 2, corresponding again to a MF of slope −2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Testi &amp; Sargent 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Elmegreen &amp; Falgarone 1996</ref>. In fact, a fractal structure with dimension between 1.5 and 2.5 is generally found for the interstellar medium, galactic star fields, and even dwarf irregular galaxies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Elmegreen &amp; Elmegreen 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">, Par- odi &amp; Binggeli 2003</ref>. This MF universality has been interpreted as direct evidence for a universal formation mechanism for stars and star clusters in turbulent gas clouds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Elmegreen &amp; Efremov 1997)</ref>. The origin of the scale-invariant clumpy structure of the gas itself is not known; it could result from gravitational fragmentation, collisional agglomeration, or turbulence (see <ref type="bibr">references in Elmegreen &amp; Efremov 1997)</ref>. Nor is it clear what physical parameters determine the slope of the MF, why it is −2; the physics involved is exceedingly complex (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jappsen et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>In the realm of stars and star clusters we should in principle also consider the question of lifetimes, in addition to formation processes (this point was brought to our attention by the referee of this paper). The lifetimes of stars were explicitely dealt with in our calculation of the MF of an evolved stellar population. Low-mass stars can get older than a Hubble time, anyway. The same is true for high-mass globular clusters. However, open clusters are known to have only a lifetime of a few 100 Myr (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Piskunov et al. 2006</ref>). So one could indeed wonder why they match the extrapolated MF of stars so well (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 20</ref>). Apparently, their smaller lifetimes (as compared to the bulk of stars) are to a certain degree compensated by a higher formation efficiency. This is in accord with the basic fact that star formation efficiency is generally higher in high-density regions, which of course happen to be the loci of bound cluster formation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Elmegreen 2006</ref>).</p><p>In any case, it is a remarkable coincidence that, on the scale of stars and star clusters, the bottomup CDM formation scenario should produce the same slope, and even similar amplitude, as the top-down star formation scenario. The underlying physical processes, even if not exactly known, are expected to be totally different. -Or is it conceivable that the DM substructure in galaxies has some influence on the fragmentation of the gas, thereby imprinting on the cloud structure the same "universal" mass distribution? This is difficult to imagine but should not be excluded without further investigation. It was questioned whether microhalos could survive the tidal perturbations by other DM halos and, within the Galaxy, by stars and molecular clouds. But recent work (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Go- erdt et al. 2007)</ref> reaffirms that due to their high density (cuspy structure) most microhalos should have survived. If so, they might act on the gas in a manner that "conserves" the MF. Although different processes to explain the stellar MF are usually invoked (see above), minihalos (not microhalos) have already been causally connected with old stars and globular clusters, if only in terms of their distribution and kinematics, and not yet their MF <ref type="bibr">(Diemand, Madau &amp; Moore 2005b)</ref>.</p><p>(3) Planets, moons, and small bodies were formed by the coagulation of dust particles and the subsequent accretional growth of small planetesimals (giant planets additionally by the accretion of gas) in a bottom-up manner. However, there are also top-down processes on these scales. For instance, asteroids formed (and as a population continuously evolve) by the collisional fragmentation of large planetesimals. The formation processes for these objects are surely no less complex than for stars, and we cannot even try to explain the MF on the scale of planets and small bodies in detail. We also recall that the normalization of the planetary MF (their abundance per cubic Mpc) remains very uncertain, simply because we know them only very nearby. However, one property of the MF on these small scales is noteworthy: the general slope appears to be significantly flatter than the "universal" −2. Again we can only speculate on the reason for this difference. In the mass range from stars to the largest structures in the universe, gravitation is certainly the basic agent of structure formation, be it by bottom-up clustering or top-down fragmentation. On smaller scales, however, gravitation becomes less dominant and electromagnetic forces come into play; very small asteroids (rocks), e.g., are no longer held together by gravity but by van der Waals (hence electromagnetic) forces. So one could speculate that the break in the slope of the MF around the mass of planets has something to do with the transition of the main force responsible for the constitution of objects from gravity to electromagnetic forces.</p><p>In conclusion, the title question of this paper can certainly be answered by Yes. There is a universal mass function in the sense that it is possible to put together a continuous mass function "of the universe": from asteroids and planets, over stars and stellar remnants, star clusters and gas clouds, galaxies, all the way up to the richest custers of galaxies. There is also a universal mass function in the sense that the slope of most individual mass functions and that of the grand total is very similar: φ(M )roughly ∝ M −2 . We have no explanation for this nearly universal slope for very different scales and processes. It is not even clear whether an explanation is needed, i.e. whether it is more than a chance coincidence.</p><p>It would certainly be interesting to extend the MF of astronomical objects from asteroids further down in mass to meter-size and submeter-size bodies (which would have to include living things such as the reader!), to dust, molecules, atoms, nuclei, and finally elementary particles. Such an -even more speculative -extension was not aimed at here.</p><p>We thank Gustav Tammann, Helmut Jerjen, Pavel Kroupa, and Ralf Klessen for inspiration and fruitful discussions, Jay Gallagher for a crucial advice, and the anonymous referee for interesting comments.
