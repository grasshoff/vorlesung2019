				<p>This study is motivated by the problem of evaluating reliable false alarm (FA) rates for sinusoid detection tests applied to unevenly sampled time series involving colored noise, when a (small) training data set of this noise is available. While analytical expressions for the FA rate are out of reach in this situation, we show that it is possible to combine specific periodogram standardization and bootstrap techniques to consistently estimate the FA rate. We also show that the procedure can be improved by using generalized extreme-value distributions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>This study is motivated by the problem of assessing reliable false alarm (FA) rates for detection tests when the noise is colored, with partially unknown statistics and when the sampling is not regular. Sinusoid (or more generally periodicity) detection tests are often based on the (Schuster's) periodogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P (ν) := 1 N N j=1 X(t j )e −i2πνtj 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>with {X(t j )} j=1,...,N the data samples and ν the frequency.</p><p>In the case of uneven time sampling, which is of concern in the present study, the periodogram ordinates in (1) are not independent, even when the noise is white Gaussian, because the sampled exponentials are not orthogonal in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This dependence makes the analysis of FA rates difficult.</p><p>In the literature of periodicity detection, numerous "generalized" periodograms (i.e., different from (1)) have been proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), which correlate the time series with (possibly highly redundant) dictionaries of target signatures. As for Schuster's periodogram however, owing to at least one of the three following factors : (i) uneven sampling, (ii) intrinsic correlation of the considered features, (iii) partially unknown noise correlations or dependencies, the joint distribution of these periodogram ordinates is unknown (although the marginal distribution can be obtained in some cases), which prevents from deriving accurate false FA rates (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>). Empirical methods exist (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) but they often lead to inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of accurately estimating the FA rate of periodograms-based detection tests in the case of uneven sampling and partially unknown colored noise remains open. Yet, the case of irregular sampling is frequently encountered in practice, for instance in astronomical observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The present study explores a bootstrap solution to this problem. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we assume that a training data set T L of the noise is available. However, this set provides only a small number of noise samples -comparable typically to the number of data samples. In this regime, our knowledge of the statistics of the random process under H 0 remains strongly impacted by estimation noise. The working hypothesis of an available training data set is rather general, but arises in particular in the field of exoplanet detection in Radial Velocity (RV) data, where astrophysical models allow to generate time series of the noise -yet at a computational cost that makes long simulated time series out of reach. We show in the end of the paper that accurate estimates of the FA rate can nevertheless be obtained in such conditions, at least for some tests. To do so, our strategy will be to cancel the nuisances caused by the unknown noise statistics by considering standardized periodograms, for which the {t j } in (1) are unevenly spaced, and to capture the dependencies between the periodogram ordinates through bootstrap techniques.</p><p>In essence, the bootstrap is a computational tool for statistical inference using sample-driven Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to produce empirical estimates of several statistical quantities as, here, the periodogram distribution and estimates of the FA rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These techniques, initially introduced for independent and identically distributed random variables (r.v.), have been intensively studied in the last decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Bootstrap techniques exist in the case of even sampling and weakly dependent data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) and different resampling procedures have been proposed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). For longer memory processes, autoregressive (AR)-aided periodogram bootstrap consists in estimating the parameters of an AR model in the time domain and in applying a non-parametric kernel based correction in the frequency domain to counteract the effects of estimation noise on the AR parameters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>). For the uneven sampling case, "dependent wild bootstrap" adapted to weakly dependent data unevenly sampled can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and a bootstrap procedure using a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) fit on the periodogram maxima is presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As underlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for instance, the choice of the parameters of such procedures (e.g., parametric noise models, number of blocks, block lengths, data weights or repartition of the sampled blocks) can be delicate. To conclude this short review of a large literature, controlling the FA rate in sinusoid detection is problematic in the case of an uneven sampling and partially unknown colored noise, even when resorting to bootstrap techniques.</p><p>In this study, we renounce to obtain analytical expressions of the P F A . The contributions are the following : in Sec.II and Sec.III, we propose an original and automated bootstrap method based on a parametric-aided periodogram allied to periodogram standardization. In Sec.IV, we propose to take advantage from GEV distributions to improve the method and, in Sec.V, we present some of our numerical results, including an application to exoplanet detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. STANDARDIZED PERIODOGRAM AND STATISTICAL TEST</head><p>Let us consider an observed time series of Power Spectrum Density (PSD) S, noted X obs |S, involving a random process (with unknown PSD S E ), plus possibly a periodic component, sampled at uneven time instants {t j } j=1,...,N obs . In some applications a training data set of the noise is available. Specifically, let us assume that this training data set T L is composed with L time series of the noise {X } =1,...,L , sampled at the same time instants {t j }. This set can be exploited to improve the control of the FA rate. In this aim, the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> considered a standardized periodogram of the form :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (ν k ; X obs |S E , {X |S E }) := P (ν k ; X obs |S) P L (ν k ; {X |S E })<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P L (ν k ) := 1 L L =1 1 N N j=1 X (t j )e −i2πν k tj 2 (3)</formula><p>is an estimate of the noise PSD. In this setting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> shows that P is independent of the unknown noise PSD and F (2, 2L)-distributed. The stochastic estimation noise on the PSD S E is encapsulated by the parameter L, with of course better detection performances for larger L. Several CFAR detectors can be derived using this standardized periodogram, whose FA rate can be analytically characterized in the case of even time sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In the present study, we focus on uneven sampling. We illustrate our study with P as defined by <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref> but other periodograms could be used, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Because of lack of space we consider below only one test, namely the test of the maximum applied to standardized ordinates</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ P ν1 . . . P ν K ].</formula><p>This test is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M ( P ) H1 H0 γ, with M ( P ) := max k P (ν k ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and γ is the detection threshold. The associated P F A is defined as :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P F A (γ; M ( P )) := Pr (M ( P ) &gt; γ|H 0 ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. PROPOSED BOOTSTRAP PROCEDURE</head><p>Our goal is to obtain a confidence interval for the P F A corresponding to any value of γ. Of course, if we could generate as many realizations as desired of the r.v.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">M ( P ) (resulting in, say b, realizations {m i } i=1,...,b of the r.v. M , collected in a vector m := [m 1 . . . m b ] )</formula><p>, we would be able to estimate the empirical distribution of the maximum and thus the P F A by :</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P F A (γ; m) := 1 − Φ M (γ; m),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where Φ M is the empirical cdf of M , and where the dependency of the estimates on the observed values m is explicit. We can not do so however, because the training data set has finite size L. To counteract this fact, we may estimate the parameters of the noise from {X |S E } =1,..,L under some model, with the aim of generating secondary noise data sets according to this estimated model. We opt for AR models, with PSD :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">S E,AR (ν; θ AR ) := σ 2 o 1+ o j=1 c j e −2πijν 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">θ AR := [o c j σ 2 o ]</formula><p>is the AR parameter vector (order o, coefficients {c j } j=1,··· ,o and prediction error variance σ 2 o ). Various selection criteria exist to estimate the order (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>). We consider here the Bridge criterion (BC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, known to mix the advantages of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">o = arg min o BC(o) with BC(o) := log σ 2 o +2 o M N o i=1 1 i ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>with o M the largest candidate order and</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">θ AR := [ o c j σ 2</formula><p>o ] the estimated AR parameters, from which a PSD estimate S E can be obtained as in (6). These parameters also allow to generate (L + 1) × b correlated time series, noted {X | S E }, allowing to generate simulated standardized periodograms { P (ν k ; X| S E , {X | S E })}, each requiring 1 time series for numerator (1) and L for denominator (3). The resulting b maxima can be used to estimate the P F A with (5).</p><p>However E , i = 1, . . . , B) are generated by reestimating the AR parameters on a i-th fake training data set noted {X | S E } (for simplicity, we omit the dependence in i in this notation, lines 4-5). These parameters are used to generate b standardized periodograms (line 7-11), the corresponding maxima (line 12) and P F A estimates (line 14). The distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">D P F A</formula><p>is estimated from the set of B such estimates, { P</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(i) F A } i=1,.</formula><p>.,B (line 16). Of course, one advantage of this procedure is that it is independent from the data under test (in contrast to procedures where training data set are not available, and for which the noise statistics must be obtained from the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). An other interesting point is that the marginal distribution of P (ν k ) can be estimated for all k, opening the door to tests other than (4) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). We note, however, that the choice of the parametric model has to be done very cautiously. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, diagnostic plots can be used for model validation. </p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Algorithm Proposed bootstrap procedure (B 0 ) 1 procedure B 0 (T L ) 2 S E (ν k ; θ AR ({X |S E })) 1 st PSD estimation (7) 3 for i = 1, . . . , B do 4 X | S E L time series with PSD S E 5 S (i) E (ν k ; θ AR ({X | S E }) 2 nd estimation (7) 6 for j = 1, . . . , b do 7 X| S (i) E A time series with PSD S (i) E 8 P (ν k ; X| S (i) E ) Numerator 9 X | S (i) E L time series with PSD S E 10 P L (ν k ; X | S (i) E )<label>Denominator</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. USE OF GEV DISTRIBUTIONS</head><p>The B 0 procedure above does not rely on any model for the cdf of M , Φ M , in (5). To be efficient, this estimation requires b to be large, which makes it computationally expensive (see Sec.V-B). However, interesting results from univariate extreme-value theory show that the maximum of a set of identically distributed (dependent or not) r.v. follows a GEV distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This suggests that GEV distributions can be used as a model for the cdf of max k P (ν k ). This method was used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in the case of white noise but we show below that it can also be used in the case of colored noise when a training data set is available, using the considered standardization.</p><p>The GEV cdf depends on three parameters, the location µ ∈ R, the scale σ ∈ R + and the shape ξ ∈ R :  <ref type="formula">(8)</ref> at 0. In the previous Algorithm, the unknown parameters (ξ, µ, σ) can be estimated using m (i) (line 12), for instance by maximum likelihood. In this case the maximization can be obtained by an iterative method (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). Denoting by ξ (i) , µ (i) , and σ (i) the estimated GEV parameters, P</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">G</formula><p>F A can be estimated as in (5). The estimated threshold associated to a target P F A can be computed from (5) and (8) as :</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">γ (i) (P F A ) = ˆ µ (i) − ˆ σ (i) ˆ ξ (i) 1 − {−log(1 − P F A )} − ˆ ξ (i)</formula><p>for ξ = 0. In the following, we will note by B the B 0 procedure using the GEV model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. NUMERICAL RESULTS</head><p>The first results are obtained using a synthetic colored noise in order to analyze and validate the B 0 procedure (Sec. V-A) and its "GEV-based" form (Sec. V-B). Sec. V-C presents an application involving real solar data standardized by hydrodynamic simulations (HDS) of the Sun.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V-A. Proposed bootstrap method B 0</head><p>We first consider a synthetic colored noise, E, as an AR(6) process with coefficients c = {0.7, 0.05, 0, 0.3, 0, −0.3}. The theoretical PSD S E is given by (6). It is represented by the green curve in the panels a) and b) of <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref>. For the uneven sampling, we consider a regular grid {t k := k ∆t} k=1,..,N with N = 1024 and ∆t = 1, from which we randomly select N = 103 data points. The first row of <ref type="figure">Fig.1</ref> illustrates a snapshot of B 0 (see Algorithm). We generate L = 20 synthetic time series following the true PSD S E , noted {X |S E }, from which we can compute an averaged periodogram P L |S E (panel a), black solid line). The dashed red curve in panel a) illustrates the primary parametric PSD estimate S E obtained from {X |S E } using the BC criterion given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. In panel b), the blue dashed line illustrates one secondary PSD estimate S (i) E obtained from a 'fake training data set' {X | S E } of L simulated time series. This panel also shows for comparison with a) the averaged periodogram P L | S E (red solid line). Panel c) displays one standardized periodogram obtained from L + 1 series {X | S (i) E }, with the maximum value m (i) j indicated by the red circle. In this simulation, we obtain B = 5200 estimates P (i)</p><p>F A (γ) as in (5) (grey curves in d). The true P F A (more precisely an accurate estimation obtained through 10 5 MC simulations of the true AR process) is shown in green. We see that the estimates bound the true P F A over the whole γ range. In the inset panel e), we compare with a classical P F A bootstrap estimation procedure that would ignore noise correlations and use the Generalized Lomb Scargle periodogram (P GLS ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, a periodogram frequently used in Astronomy. In this procedure, we generate unevenly sampled light curves by resampling the data (through random permutations), evaluate the P GLS , compute the maximum and perform test (4) with P |P L replaced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P GLS | σ 2 W := P GLS / σ 2 W with σ 2</formula><p>W the variance estimated from the data. This provides one estimate P F A (γ) and we repeat this experiment 10 3 times. The resulting curves P F A (γ) are plotted in black. The true P F A of this procedure (in red) has been generated with 10 5 MC simulations. The method fails to estimate accurately the FA rate, because this simple resampling by permutation breaks the data correlation. This is in clear contrast with the procedure shown in d), which takes benefit from the training data set. Panel f) shows, in grey, the distribution D P F A (B 0 ) for a threshold fixed at γ F = 10.6 corresponding to a true P F A of 0.1 (green). We see that the estimates bound the true value with a relatively small dispersion. The 95% confidence interval, obtained from the Gaussian approximation (red), is indicated in blue and indeed contains the true P F A . V-B. Use of the GEV distribution</p><p>In practice, one limitation of the B 0 procedure is its computation time, related in particular to the large number (b) of periodogram maxima required for the estimation to be accurate. To reduce b while keeping a tight confidence interval for the P F A , we consider applying the version of the bootstrap procedure using the GEV approximation (B ). The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.2</ref> compares, as a function of b, the empirical means (solid lines, right ordinate axis) and dispersions (dashed lines, left ordinate axis) for the distributions of the FA estimates by three methods (see legend) when the test is ran at a true P F A of 0.1. All procedures lead to a decreasing dispersion and bias in the mean as b increases, with similar estimation performances for D  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.

Application to exoplanet detection As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, an application of this work is the detection of exoplanetary signatures in the noise of RV data. In short, orbiting planets create, through the gravitational force, a quasi-periodic Doppler shift in the stellar light, leading to so-called RV time series. The stellar surface of solarlike stars are convectively unstable. Convection is a stationary stochastic process which generates (large) fluctuations around the hydrostatic equilibrium of the star. HDS of the inhomogeneous pattern (called granulation) have been substantially improved in the last decade <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> offering the opportunity to generate simulated time series (yet few, owing to the computational cost of the HDS), that can be used as a training data set T L . We consider here solar RV data acquired by the GOLF spectrophotometer on board SoHo satellite <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The periodogram of 30h observations is shown in the inset panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3 (top, black)</ref>. Different phenomena occur depending on the considered frequency. Here, we focus only on the granulation noise, which is active over minutes to days (grey shaded region) corresponding to the temporal scale of closein planets. As an illustration of HDS, we show an averaged periodogram P L obtained through L = 6 independent HDS of the granulation solar noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, covering the frequency range associated to periods of 10 min to 1 day (red). For our experiment, we introduce in the data a fake  . This situation corresponds to a Keplerian signature of a 0.27 Earth-mass planet, orbiting a Sun-like star with circular orbit and period of 6h. The left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3</ref> displays P obtained from evenly sampled data (see title). In this case the P F A of test <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(4)</ref> is given Eq.(18) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The theoretical (asymptotically exact) thresholds corresponding to three target P F A (respectively, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9) are indicated by the black horizontal (respectively dotted, dash-dotted and dashed) lines. The color dashed lines indicate the ≈ 95% confidence intervals obtained by B 0 for the three thresholds. Comparing with the black lines shows that the bootstrap method works well. Similar results are obtained in the case of uneven sampling (right panel), where the data is obtained by randomly selecting N = 30 samples of the evenly sampled time series. The corresponding spectral window (modulus of the Fourier Transform of the observation window) is plotted in grey in the inset panel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This paper has investigated the possibility of using noise training data sets to improve the control of the false alarm rate associated to detection tests. This method is based on standardized periodograms, which have been considered in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> but in the case of regularly sampled observations. By developing an adapted bootstrap procedure in the Fourier domain, it appears that one can reliably bound the false alarm probability in the general case of irregularly sampled observations. However, as this procedure is based on MC simulations, it is computationally heavy. Exploiting a GEV distribution allows to save time while keeping the same behavior for the resulting FA estimates. This procedure can be useful for the detection of extrasolar planets in RV data. In this case, the time sampling is often uneven, the exoplanetary signatures hidden in the colored noise coming for the stellar surface convection and this noise can be simulated using astrophysical codes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>&gt; 0 .</head><label>0</label><figDesc>In the case ξ = 0, G is derived by taking the limit of</figDesc></figure>

This situation corresponds to a Keplerian signature of a 0.27 Earth-mass planet, orbiting a Sun-like star with circular orbit and period of 6h. The left panel of Fig.3 displays P obtained from evenly sampled data (see title). In this case the P F A of test (4) is given Eq.(18) of [7]. The theoretical (asymptotically exact) thresholds corresponding to three target P F A (respectively, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9) are indicated by the black horizontal (respectively dotted, dash-dotted and dashed) lines. The color dashed lines indicate the ≈ 95% confidence intervals obtained by B 0 for the three thresholds. Comparing with the black lines shows that the bootstrap method works well. Similar results are obtained in the case of uneven sampling (right panel), where the data is obtained by randomly selecting N = 30 samples of the evenly sampled time series. The corresponding spectral window (modulus of the Fourier Transform of the observation window) is plotted in grey in the inset panel.</figDesc></figure>
