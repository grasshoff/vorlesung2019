			<abstract>
				<p>The feasibility of using data from the NASA STEREO mission for variable star and asteroseismology studies has been examined. A data analysis pipeline has been developed that is able to apply selected algorithms to the entire database of nearly a million stars to search for signs of variability. An analysis limited to stars of magnitude 10.5 has been carried out, which has resulted in the extraction of 263 eclipsing binaries (EBs), of which 122 are not recorded as such in the SIMBAD online database. The characteristics of the STEREO observations are shown to be extremely well-suited to variable star studies with the ability to provide continuous phase coverage for extended periods as well as repeated visits that allow both short and long term variability to be observed. This will greatly inform studies of particular stars, such as the pre-cataclysmic variable V471 Tau, as well as entire classes of stars, including many forms of rotational variability. The high-precision photometry has also revealed a potentially substellar companion to a bright (R = 7.5 mag) nearby star (HD 213597), detected with 5 Ïƒ significance. This would provide a significant contribution to exoplanet research if follow-up observations ascertain the mass to be within the planetary domain. Some particularly unusual EBs from the recovered sample are discussed, including a possible reclassification of a well-known star as an EB rather than a rotational variable (HR 7355) and several particularly eccentric systems, including very long-period EBs.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The STEREO mission consists of two satellites in heliocentric orbit, each observing the solar environment from the Sun's atmosphere out to the Earth's orbit and together producing 3D images of this region ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Kaiser et al. 2008</ref>). The HI-1 imager on the Ahead spacecraft (HI-1A) has been used to conduct a survey for variability of stars down to magnitude 12 in its field of view (within about 20 degrees of the Ecliptic Plane, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref>). The lightcurves produced have been analysed to look for exoplanet transits and eclipsing binaries. The value of eclipsing variables in studies of stellar properties and evolution is well-known (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mink et al. 2010</ref>) and the trends from this sample, as well as some particular stars of interest, will prove informative. The detection of many new eclipsing binaries around comparatively bright stars, previously undetected in many cases due to shallow eclipses, allows for the detailed follow-up required to improve upon existing models of stellar evolution and behaviour. Also of note is a comparison of the effectiveness of different algorithms in extracting the signatures of eclipsing binaries of different types.</p><p>The rest of this paper is divided into sections giving an overview of the STEREO/HI-1A characteristics, describing the data analysis pipeline, the results obtained, prospects for further study, the conclusions that can be drawn and the table showing all 263 EBs is given at the end.</p><p>Further research is being undertaken to identify and characterise other kinds of variability, which will be the subject of future papers. Some HI-1B data has been extracted (for a region between 50 and 60 degrees right ascension and 10 and 20 degrees declination, which includes a variety of interesting objects, e.g. V 471 Tau -see Section 4) but this has not yet been analysed on a large scale. The HI-1B imager is on the side of the spacecraft facing the direction of travel and the lightcurves show artefacts resulting from micrometeorite impacts, complicating the task of signal extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">STEREO/HI-1A INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA PREPARATION</head><p>The Heliospheric Imager on the STEREO-Ahead spacecraft (HI-1A) provided the data for the large-scale analysis. A summary of the data analysis pipeline is given in the Appendix. This instrument is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. (2009)</ref> but for convenience a summary is given here. The HI-1A has a field of view of 20 degrees by 20 degrees and is centred on a point 14 degrees away from the centre of the Sun, where the solar F-corona is the dominant large-scale structure. The aperture of the HI-1A lens system is 16 mm, with a focal length of 78 mm. The CCD has a pixel size such that the plate scale becomes 35 arcsec on a 2048x2048 chip, with images binned 2x2 on-board, resulting in 1024x1024 images being returned with an image bin size of 70 arcsec. A filter limits the spectral bandpass to 630-730 nm with some contribution around 400 nm and 950 nm. The characteristics of the CCD on the HI-1B are similar, with only slight differences in the spectral bandpass ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. 2009</ref>). Each image is the result of 30 summed exposures, each of 40 seconds, with one image produced every 40 minutes. This prevents saturation by cosmic rays, although planetary and cometary incursions do cause saturation, and also allows for very faint structures in Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and the solar environment to be detected. Stars down to 12th magnitude are detectable and about 650000 stars have been recorded with listed magnitudes brighter than 11.5, with almost 75000 of these being brighter than magnitude 9.5 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Only the very brightest stars, those brighter than about 3rd magnitude, saturate the detector but useful lightcurves can nevertheless still be extracted. Since these stars are mostly within 20 degrees of the ecliptic plane, STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B are therefore searching a region of the sky not well observed by dedicated exoplanet searches, such as CoRoT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Auvergne, M. et al. 2009</ref>) (V magnitudes from 11 to 16), <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Koch et al. 2010</ref>) (R magnitudes from 7 to 17) and SuperWASP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pollacco et al. 2006</ref>) (V magnitudes from 9 to 13), and it is also able to view much brighter stars than are normally observed. Before the data from STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B can be analysed, it must be passed through a pipeline (shown in the Appendix, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure B1</ref>) in order to</p><p>â€¢ Make a shutterless correction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. 2009)</ref> â€¢ Apply a large-scale flat field ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. 2010)</ref> â€¢ Apply the pointing calibration to determine the positions of stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown et al. 2009)</ref> â€¢ Flag out saturated pixels/columns and missing data blocks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. 2009)</ref> â€¢ Carry out a daily background subtraction</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Shutterless correction</head><p>The STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B cameras have no shutter and remain exposed during the readout process and also during the clear process prior to each exposure. Consequently, the top of the image is exposed for longer than the bottom of the image, resulting in image smearing during readout. The effect of this can be expressed as a matrix relationship and a correction for the effects of the shutterless operation can be made by a matrix multiplication. If saturation occurs anywhere in a column, then the signal in the affected pixels cannot be corrected in this way and the entire column is flagged as bad data. Further details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>STEREO observations of stars and the search for exoplanets 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Flat fields</head><p>The sensitivity of the STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B cameras varies spatially in three distinct ways. Firstly, the optical properties mean that the solid angle corresponding to each pixel may vary across the field of view, leading to large variations in scale across the CCD. Secondly, the sensitivity of the CCD varies for individual pixels, independently of the sensitivity of adjacent pixels. Thirdly, debris and manufacturing variations and defects on the CCD generate variations in sensitivity over the scale of tens to hundreds of pixels. It is unknown to what extent the sensitivity of the CCD will vary over time but it is anticipated that the largely stationary F-corona in the field of view may be enough to cause some degradation. The flat field calibration is updated on a regular basis, however, which should prevent this becoming a problem.</p><p>The flat field calibrations are performed on STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B images after the removal of the CCD DC bias ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eyles et al. 2009</ref>) and the application of the shutterless correction.</p><p>Images with significant optical ghosts due to saturated objects in the data are not used for flat fielding. The methodology is detailed in full in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. (2010)</ref>. Observations of stars near a region of the frame close to the edge of the solar disk are discarded due to additional noise of solar origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Pointing calibration</head><p>Calibrated instrument pointing solutions have been derived by comparing the locations of stars identified in the STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B images with known star positions given in the NOMAD astrometric dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zacharias et al. 2004</ref>). In the raw (L0.5) data, nominal pointing information is provided, however once the data has been processed to L1 (by running secchi prep) the calibrated pointing information is provided. Full details on the calibration and pointing procedure can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>For the STEREO/HI-1A and HI-1B cameras, the average root mean square distance between stars as seen in the image and the location given in the catalogue is about 0.1 pixels, i.e. 7 arcsec. Thus any pointing offsets have a negligible effect on the efficacy of the stellar lightcurves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Photometric calibration</head><p>The methodology used to determine the photometric calibration is described in full in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. (2010)</ref>, which includes more up-to-date flat fields and calibration constants than were available for the analysis presented in this paper. Aperture photometry of well-isolated stars down to 12th magnitude is used, that have no other stars with a difference of â‰¤1 magnitude within 1000 arcsec. Whilst future large-scale analyses will use the most upto-date calibration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. (2010)</ref>, the photometric calibration of the STEREO/HI-1A used in the analysis presented herein is described by the following formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">STEREO magnitude = d log( counts c )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where d = âˆ’2.49501 and c = 18337.7 for STEREO/HI-1A for a 3.5 pixel radius aperture. The number of counts is expressed as a flux intensity in units in data numbers, DNs âˆ’1 as provided by secchi prep. For analysing HI-1B, the following formula is used (explained more fully in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. (2010)</ref>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">STEREO magnitude = d log( a * counts b * c )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where d = âˆ’2.5, a = 4 is a correction factor , b = 0.98 and c = 97026 are the calibration constants for STEREO/HI-1B for a 3.5 pixel radius aperture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">DATA ANALYSIS PIPELINE AND METHODS</head><p>Three methods were used to quantify the variability of each star in the STEREO/HI-1A database with a magnitude of 10.5 or greater, thus eliminating the faintest stars with the lowest signal-to-noise ratio ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the locations of stars with measured mean magnitude of 9th magnitude and brighter with more than twenty photometric points on their lightcurve). They were: the Box-Least-Squares (BLS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">KovÃ¡cs et al. 2002)</ref>, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Scargle 1982)</ref> and Stetson's variability index <ref type="bibr">(Welch &amp; Stetson 1993)</ref>. IDL code to produce a Lomb-Scargle periodogram was obtained from Armagh Observatory, whilst the others were custom implementations. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the steps in the analysis as produced by the programs doing the analysis.</p><p>Before being passed to the algorithms for analysis, a 7th order polynomial fit was carried out for each lightcurve to remove both natural and artificial trends that might obscure the faintest transit signals (the top two graphs of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> show an example lightcurve before and after this polynomial detrending). It should be emphasized that whether or not there is genuine long term variability that would be removed by this is not a concern as the focus is on recovering eclipsing variables and exoplanet transits whilst retaining the capacity to detect other short term variables, such as RR Lyrae and Î´ Scuti stars. The IDL built-in routine poly_fit was the basis of this. Each lightcurve was then passed through a combined low and high pass filter in an attempt to remove some remaining noise. This was done by transforming into the frequency domain using the IDL built-in routine fft and applying a mask that blocked all features within one standard deviation of the mean before using the inverse transform to return to the time domain. This process was repeated for each epoch of observations for each star and each epoch was analysed separately by the different algorithms (The third graph in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the BLS spectrum). The strongest signals found from analysing all the epochs for each star were recorded and stored in an output file associated with each field of view, as were a variety of other statistics (q.v. Section B).</p><p>The reasons for processing each epoch separately are the presence of noise and artefact features that exist within one or more epochs but seldom all, such as a planetary incursion into the field of view by Venus or Mercury, the existence of some features near the beginning or end of some epochs as a result of streamers or other solar activity and the presence of occasional de-pointing events, typically from micrometeorite impacts, all of which would produce a false signal if all epochs were analysed together. As the highest values from all epochs are stored, these features still give some false signals but by analysing data from unaffected epochs a genuine value may sometimes supersede the false one. Nevertheless, the severity of some noise and artefacts precludes detection of faint signals, which is only partially alleviated in some cases by a direct visual inspection of lightcurves for signs of genuine variability.</p><p>Once a star had been identified as an eclipsing binary candidate on the basis of the statistics generated, its detrended, filtered lightcurve and phase-folded lightcurves on the periods of the strongest signals found by the BLS and Lomb-Scargle analysis were examined visually to determine if the variability detected was likely to be genuine. An initial classification of the type of variability was made at this stage. Those that were considered likely to be eclipsing binaries were imported into the software package PERANSO <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Vanmunster 2008</ref>) for more detailed analysis. There is the possibility that many contact binary systems might have been excluded at this stage due to an inability to distinguish between different types of variability. Indeed, there is some evidence that a significant number of <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The main stages of the detrending and analysis, demonstrated by the star HR 1750. Starting with the top graph showing the raw light curve for one epoch of observations, the next graph down shows the results of detrending with a 7th order polynomial, the third graph shows the periodogram derived from the detrended lightcurve and the bottom graph is the lightcurve phase-folded on the period of the strongest signal found from the periodogram. Note that it is unknown whether the trend removed by the polynomial fitting is artificial or genuine variability -this potential long term variability is not the type of variability being searched for. fainter contact binaries may have been excluded in this manner (Section 6).</p><p>Within PERANSO, a detailed analysis of the BLS spectrum would be used to establish as accurate a period as possible using as many epochs as possible, using the software's ability to manually exclude observation points that are likely to be noise or artefacts. The lightcurve phase-folded from this period would be used to finally determine if the star was likely to be an eclipsing binary. If it was still considered an eclipsing binary, the phase-folded lightcurve would provide estimates of the primary eclipse depth and minimum eccentricity. The minimum eccentricity would be estimated by visually determining the offset of secondary eclipses, where these could be distinguished as such, from a phase of 0.5 away from the primary eclipse. The estimated errors in the estimate were taken as the extremes of the possible ranges of where the secondary minimum might be, thus the errors are larger for smoother, shallower eclipses as in many contact binaries. The values ob-STEREO observations of stars and the search for exoplanets tained were then, along with the errors, multiplied by two, giving a value that is actually |e Ã— cos Ï‰| or effectively a minimum eccentricity that could be significantly higher depending on the value of Ï‰, the argument of periastron. The values of the period, primary eclipse depth and |e Ã— cos Ï‰| found from this detailed examination were recorded, along with the output of the different algorithms, the star's Celestial co-ordinates, its identity (from SIMBAD) and spectral type (from SIMBAD) as well as the identity of any nearby star (within 6 arc-minutes, from SIMBAD) that could potentially have contaminated the signal and whether or not either the star or this neighbour had previously been identified as an eclipsing binary. This dataset of 263 eclipsing binaries <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table  B1</ref>) was then explored for interesting trends and patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Trends</head><p>The distributions of the recorded characteristics show some trends that apply to the sample as a whole. Most significantly, the distribution of eclipsing binaries by weighted mean magnitude ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref> shows a peak between magnitude 8.5 and 9.0 after which the numbers extracted fall off. This implies that, due to a combination of sensitivity and noise, eclipses are not being detected around fainter stars since the distribution of eclipsing binaries is expected to match the distribution of stars in the database, the numbers of which continue to increase with increasing magnitude.</p><p>The periods given in the statistics are the primary-to- primary period, although difficulty in distinguishing primary from secondary eclipses may cause the resulting value to be out by a factor of 2. The distribution of the periods of the eclipsing binaries extracted reflects, as expected, the bias due to the length of individual epochs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4</ref>). In order to get a good signal, three transits must be observed within an epoch and thus there is a tendency to find periods of less than this threshold. Through the presence of secondary eclipses longer periods can be found but visual examination is required for detecting the very longest period eclipsing binaries, especially if the system is eccentric. The star with the longest period confirmed of the 263 is HD 72208 with 22.013 days (see Section 4 for details), which cannot be found through a separate analysis of each epoch but only through all three epochs presently available, owing to the significant eccentricity (|eÃ—cos Ï‰| = 0.391Â±0.006) and the fact that no more than two transits are observed in any epoch. There is a suspected eclipsing binary with a potentially longer period showing only one primary eclipse in each epoch (HD 173770, see Section 4) but a definite period determination cannot be made and it was not included in the sample. The distribution of the depths of primary eclipses reveals a trend that is interpreted as the presence of different populations of eclipsing binary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>). Only detached and semidetached EBs appear to have a primary eclipse depth greater than 0.5 magnitudes, whereas contact binaries predominate at depths of 0.3 magnitudes and below.</p><p>The estimates of |e Ã— cos Ï‰| reveal that 24 of the 263 eclipsing binaries have measurable eccentricity (see the Appendix for their phase-folded lightcurves). Other EBs in the sample may have eccentricity, as the value of the argument of periastron, Ï‰, is unknown and there are some that show a hint of eccentricity but the margin of error does not preclude the possibility that they might have zero eccentricity, including a couple that are exactly on the line where the error margin equals the estimate of |e Ã— cos Ï‰|. Thus a small but significant fraction of the sample are eccentric, with more than 5% showing sigificant eccentricity. The sample of eccentric systems is not quite large enough to show statistically valid trends, unfortunately, although the indications are that small eccentricities dominate with larger eccentricities being widely distributed.</p><p>Nevertheless, this result is broadly in agreement with recent findings from the Kepler mission ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Prsa et al. 2010</ref>), however the sample of stars observed by STEREO/HI-1A is not limited to main sequence stars or by other selection criteria intended to maximise the chances of finding an exoplanet transit. It is therefore a useful result that it appears to find a similar distribution of |e Ã— cos Ï‰| to the Kepler sample as it implies that eccentricity is not dependent upon spectral type. Eccentric systems are expected to circularise over time and thus these systems are much-studied in the field of stellar evolution to model interactions between multiple stars as an interaction with a third body is usually required for them to be formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Claret &amp; Willems 2002)</ref>. The distribution of spectral types of the eclipsing binary primary stars shows a predominance of younger, hotter stars of earlier spectral types <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>). The main limitation of this distribution is that the spectral type of the closest star to the co-ordinates of the perceived eclipsing binary may not always be the star that is actually eclipsing, due to the low spatial with a known spectral type, showing the relationship between spectral type and period. The most common spectral type is A2, with 22 stars in the sample. There are no clear patterns connecting the spectral type with period, however there are some cases where the specific star causing the eclipses has not been identified and the spectral type is of the star closest to the target co-ordinates (see Appendix A).</p><p>resolution and the possible contamination of lightcurves by nearby stars. The distribution will also be affected by any bias in the STEREO/HI-1A database, with only stars brighter than magnitude 10.5 being analysed en masse (although one or two fainter examples were identified visually). The distribution of eclipsing binaries by their signal detection efficiency (SDE) from the BLS algorithm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 9</ref>) shows two indistinct peaks, interpreted as corresponding to two different types of eclipsing binary. The peak with the highest SDE corresponds mostly to detached binaries, whose lightcurves are a closer match to the box-like shape the BLS algorithm checks for. The broader peak with the lower SDE corresponds to contact binaries, which have smoother, more sinusoidal lightcurves. An Algol type binary might be the highest-rated by the BLS algorithm in its field but contact binaries can sometimes be near the bottom of such a list and thus are not reliably detected by this algorithm. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram, (distribution shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>), preferentially reveals contact binaries, although it typically does give a signal for many detached binaries as well, albeit increasingly less so for shallower, more box-like eclipses ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>). Combining the BLS and the Lomb-Scargle methods thus produces a positive signal for the vast majority of the eclipsing binaries, with those rated poorly by both being stars with fewer data points (both algorithms give higher scores for more data points, thus stars with less data available are rated less highly), those with very long periods and those with comparatively low signal-to-noise that were detected by visual examination. The effect of the period on the output of the BLS and Lomb-Scargle methods was also investigated ( <ref type="bibr">Figures 12 and 13)</ref>. The dependence discovered is again likely representative of the shape of the transits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLS SIGNAL DETECTION EFFICIENCY</head><p>As a variety of noise signatures were encountered in the dataset, some very clearly obscuring genuine signals, producing both false positives and false negatives, an attempt to evaluate the effects of noise was made ( <ref type="bibr">Figures 14, 15, 16 and 17)</ref>. Together these appear to show a tendency to overlook shallow eclipses. This may be partly due to a mixture of red and white noise and also due to problems classifying contact binaries as such when their lightcurves are not clear enough to distinguish them from sinusoidal variations. Blending also has a tendency to obscure faint signals, with the brightest object in the photometric aperture dominating but showing additional signals overlaid, or with stars of similar magnitudes showing constructive or destructive interference resembling an amplitude modulation. This has the effect of lowering, broadening and sometimes splitting peaks in a periodogram analysis, which affects the ability of an algorithm to identify a low-amplitude signal.</p><p>Since a large proportion of the sample of eclipsing bi-  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>.

The dependence of signal detection efficiency as a function of Stetson index. The cut-off point at about -0.5 shows that variability or noise above a certain level is obscuring the signals of some eclipsing binaries, although the apparent clustering of signals around a moderate value and especially the higher ratings for deeper eclipses shows that the Stetson index is also to some extent reflecting the variability due to eclipses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>Of the 263 eclipsing binaries extracted, 122 are not recorded as such in SIMBAD. Some of these are, however, known variables of other types or are suspected of variability. Owing to the purely photometric data available from STEREO/HI-1A, there remains the possibility of mis-classification, however care was taken to include only stars whose phase-folded lightcurves appeared to be clear cases. Thanks to the excel- lent phase coverage resulting from the STEREO/HI-1A observational cadence of 40 minutes maintained for up to 19.44 days, with three or four such epochs for most stars, the new observations are in many cases clearer than those previously available and in some cases the existing classification may be in need of revision. A total of 24 of the eclipsing binaries have measurable eccentricity and their lightcurves are shown in the Appendix ( <ref type="figure">Figure B2</ref>).</p></div>

This star is recorded in SIMBAD as being of spectral type F0 and is not suspected of any variability. The observed eclipses are box-like, with very sudden ingress and egress phases, and are uniformly about 25 mmag deep, with a period of 2.4238 days between successive eclipses ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 20)</ref>. Secondary eclipses are not evident.</p></div>

As a cataclysmic variable progenitor, with an unexpectedly massive red dwarf primary and the most massive white dwarf in the Hyades (O' <ref type="bibr">Brien et al. 2001</ref>), studies of this star may have a considerable effect on understanding the mechanism behind type 1a supernovae, thereby influencing the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and much of modern cosmology. Note that the spectral bandpass of the HI-1A and HI-1B imagers both allow a component of blue light through ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bewsher et al. 2010</ref>) and the white dwarf secondary is estimated to contribute 6 % of the flux in this part of the spectrum (O' <ref type="bibr">Brien et al. 2001</ref>). Similar behaviour can be seen in STEREO observations of RS CVn variables, e.g. SZ Psc, and shows that STEREO is a useful resource for studies of similar variability that require photometry with both long and short baselines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Highly eccentric eclipsing binaries</head><p>The most eccentric undiscovered eclipsing binary in the sample is HIP 92307, with |e Ã— cos Ï‰| = 0.500 Â± 0.020 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  24</ref>). Both primary and secondary eclipses are about 30 mmag deep, indeed it is not clear which are the primary and secondary eclipses. This star is listed as spectral type A2V.</p><p>The longest period eclipsing binary in the sample is HD 72208, with 22.0130 days between primary eclipses and |e Ã— cos Ï‰| = 0.391 Â± 0.006 , making it one of the more eccentric as well ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 25</ref>). This star, spectral type B9p, is a spectroscopic binary. Both primary and secondary eclipses are about 60 mmag deep. Possibly the longest period eclipsing binary so far observed in the STEREO/HI-1A data may be HD 173770. As there are multiple possible periods that can fit the lightcurve, it was not included in the sample. The best-fitting period that has been found with the data available shows a period of 25.145 days, which implies a minimum eccentricity |e Ã— cos Ï‰| = 0.108 Â± 0.012. The star shows some intrinsic regular variability as well, although the exact type has not been classified. The host star is listed in SIMBAD as being of spectral type B6V and is a suspected triple system. With the separation given for these components, it is unlikely either are responsible for the eclipses and this may instead be a quadruple system.

This star is a known Î² Cepheid, with an amplitude listed as 30 mmag. Given the volume of observations, it is very surprising this variability has not previously been recorded. It is in a fairly crowded area with many stars close by in the STEREO/HI-1A field of view, yet none of these are sufficiently bright to contaminate its lightcurve to the extent of eclipses as deep as those observed. The eclipses are therefore genuine and should help to further inform the parameters previously determined for this star. Interestingly, this star is also shown in SIMBAD to be a spectroscopic binary with a period of 0.2872 days, which would mean the eclipsing companion is a tertiary component and not the secondary. The Kozai effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kozai 1962</ref>) may have caused the inclination of the system to change so that eclipses are now visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5">HR 7355: rotational variable or contact binary?</head><p>One of the better-observed stars in the sample is HR 7355 (a.k.a. HIP 95408 and HD 182180). STEREO/HI-1A shows what appears to be a clear-cut case for an eclipsing binary as the phase-folding on 0.5214 days indicates in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">Figure 27</ref>. Other studies have noted this periodicity and associated it with a rotation period, however, rather than attributing it to a secondary companion, even the most recent which show the variability to be eclipse-like ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Oksala et al. 2010</ref>). We suggest that the photometry from STEREO is enough to warrant a re-appraisal of the nature of this system. It has been left in the sample as an eclipsing binary since from the photometry alone that is what it appears to be. In the wider context it is clearly an unusual and fascinating, chemically peculiar star that continues to attract further study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">False positives</head><p>A small number of stars showing variability on a similar scale to that expected of an exoplanet or brown dwarf transit could be ruled out as such from photometric data alone, or in combination with other information known about the host star.</p><p>Total eclipses just 30mmag deep were observed around either HIP 248 or HIP 247 (near-identical signals and in the same or adjacent pixels in STEREO/HIc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000-000 1A). These stars are both of spectral type F0, however the eclipses include a substantial amount of time in the ingress and egress phases. The eclipses are consistently about 30 mmag deep and 2.2604 days apart ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 21</ref>). This is a transit by a larger, stellar body rather than a brown dwarf but a low-mass star remains a possibility. The star HD 222891 has similar features to HIP 248, however the eclipses are also too deep, at 40 mmag, with the host star of spectral type F8, to be due to a brown dwarf companion. It may nevertheless be a low-mass star of some interest.</p><p>Of all eclipse-like features extracted from the STEREO/HI-1A database, the shallowest primary eclipses were 7 mmag deep around the star 18 Sgr. This lightcurve appears more like a contact binary, although the raw lightcurve is also somewhat irregular and the behaviour might instead be due to rotational microvariability. It was not considered conclusive enough to be labelled as an eclipsing binary and does not feature in the sample, although more data may help to clarify the lightcurve and its classification.</p><p>NSV 1321 is the most marginal detection in the sample. In order to verify whether the 10 mmag eclipses observed were genuine, differential photometry was carried out, however this appeared to introduce variability from a neighbouring star -it is located in a crowded field with several stars showing clear variability and others blended. Although the star itself is classified as variable, the NSV catalogue as shown in SIMBAD indicates this variability was considered doubtful by the catalogue's compilers. With the host star of spectral type B8V this would not be an exoplanet signal and is most likely a grazing eclipse or stellar companion. Although the possibility of microvariability or a blend with a neighbouring star cannot be wholly ruled out, none of the neighbouring stars show a periodicity of 2.2663 days so this was included in the sample.</p><p>Another star showing shallow eclipses that was ruled out from being a brown dwarf is II Cnc (period from STEREO/HI-1A of 1.0684 days, eclipses 25 mmag deep). This is listed in SIMBAD as a BY Draconis type variable of spectral type G8V, however there is no mention of it showing eclipses. The shape of the lightcurve is indicative of either a contact binary or grazing stellar transits with secondary eclipses present. The period is more representative of a contact binary. The secondary may nevertheless be a low-mass star, making this a relatively unusual system for a contact binary. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SURVEY PROSPECTS</head><p>Although the analysis thus far done has been restricted to recovering eclipsing binaries and searching for exoplanets, the prospects for recovering variables of different types has been investigated.</p><p>The prospects for exoplanet extraction are summarised in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 29</ref> for the declination strips away from the Galactic Plane for the ranges of periods and magnitudes shown. This indicates reasonable prospects for finding a signal, if any exist around stars of about 7th magnitude or brighter but with a sharp fall-off for fainter stars, such that the probability of extraction is negligible for stars fainter than 8th magnitude from STEREO/HI-1A data alone. Note that the most significant substellar candidate so far extracted is magnitude 7.5. For reference, the signal of HIP 247 and HIP 248 (magnitude 7.5, period 2.2604 days) is 30 mmag deep detected with a significance of 5 Ïƒ and the 30 mmag deep signal of HR 1750 (magnitude 6.5, period 3.3150 days) is detected with a significance of 8 Ïƒ. With the inclusion of STEREO/HI-1B data the number of data points will more than double (this satellite is in an Earth-trailing orbit and stars remain in the field of view for longer) and the significance of extracted signals will increase, as will the potential for extracting faint signals.</p><p>For eclipsing binaries, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 14, 17</ref> and 28 indicate that more may yet be found and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows that the combination of the BLS and Lomb-Scargle methods is a good way of extracting their signals. The difficulty here is that, from photometric data alone, it has not been possible to conclusively classify them as eclipsing binaries. This problem largely affects contact binaries, which have lightcurves that might easily be confused with elliptical variables and short period pulsating stars. The ability of the Lomb-Scargle method to extract contact binaries suggests it would be a useful tool for extracting other variables also. Asteroseismological studies are likely to require that low-level variability be detected. If a signal of 10 mmag, comparable to an exoplanet transit, is required, then <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 29</ref> might also be an indicator of the prospects for extracting microvariable behaviour, however this would assume that the algorithm chosen to extract the microvariable signal is equally effective at discerning faint signals as the BLS. Nevertheless, the prospects would appear good for the brighter stars (7th magnitude or brighter) and these are also the most amenable to high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up by other observatories. Investigations of the signals extracted by the LombScargle method show that the presence of systematic sources of noise inhibits the detection of a test signal, however, so additional cleaning would be required. Whilst the observc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000-000 ing cadence of 40 minutes will impair detailed studies of very short period variables, the ongoing examination of the data that is including STEREO/HI-1B observations is nevertheless able to obtain very clear photometry from a number of known Î´ Scuti stars (e.g. DX Cet) and potentially detect new variables down to magnitude 11.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The STEREO/HI-1A observations are clearly a valuable resource suitable for a wide range of variability studies. With 263 eclipsing binaries extracted from the database, 122 of which have not previously been identified as such, there is the potential for the discovery of a number of new and interesting objects. The area of the sky being covered and the brightness of the stars being observed are features unique to STEREO/HI-1A and simultaneously allow for high quality follow-up observations of interesting objects. There is the potential to discover transiting exoplanets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 29</ref>), however this is at the very limit of the survey's sensitivity and would only be possible for the stars with the cleanest signals. A 30 mmag transit around a magnitude 7.5 star is detectable with 5 Ïƒ significance and a 30 mmag transit of a magnitude 6.5 star is detectable with 8 Ïƒ significance from STEREO/HI-1A data alone. With the inclusion of data from the second satellite, STEREO/HI-1B, this will improve, e.g. from STEREO/HI-1A data alone the 50 mmag transits of the magnitude 8.5 star BD +03 263p are detected with 7 Ïƒ significance but with the inclusion of STEREO/HI-1B data they are detected with nearly 13 Ïƒ significance. The analysis presented here may have some impact on stellar evolution studies, in particular relating to the proportion and distribution of eccentric eclipsing binaries. As the newly-discovered eclipsing binaries are comparatively bright, the masses, radii and effective temperatures can be determined more accurately in follow-up observations and can therefore provide more stringent tests of stellar evolution models (e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Torres et al. 2006</ref>), ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">VandenBerg et al. 2006</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Claret &amp; Willems 2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Stassun et al. 2006</ref>)). The new eclipsing binaries will also help to produce more accurate distances to their host stars and any stars those are associated with <ref type="bibr">(South- worth et al. 2005</ref>).</p><p>The potential to improve upon existing phase coverage, especially relating to that obtained during eclipses, and times of maxima and minima in a variability cycle can help to refine parameters for these important stars. In some cases, the capability of STEREO to deliver good photometry over timescales of days and weeks in a single pass, combined with repeated observations after about a year, are ideal for observing longterm changes in variability. This is of particular importance in studies of magnetic activity cycles (eg. V471 Tau) and particular classes of variables, such as RS CVn stars (eg. SZ Psc). The eclipsing binaries newly discovered by this analysis show a tendency to possess shallower transits than those previously known <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 18</ref>), partly due to the quality and cadence of the photometry. With many of the host stars being of early spectral types, late B and early A, it is possible that many of these systems may be comparatively young <ref type="figure">(Figure 8)</ref>. A small but significant proportion are in eccentric orbits <ref type="figure">(Fig- ures 6 and 7</ref>), supporting recent observations by <ref type="bibr">Kepler (Prsa et al. 2010</ref>). Some particularly interesting systems have been identified for potential follow-up observations, including one good brown dwarf candidate (HD 213597, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 20)</ref>. The proportion of stars of different magnitudes found to be eclipsing indicates that more may yet be found as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">Figure 28</ref> shows decreasing numbers observed with fainter stars, whereas the real number should be a constant proportion of the population.</p><p>Evaluation of the algorithms used to extract eclipsing binaries suggests that, if exoplanets alone are the target, then the Box-Least-Squares (BLS) algorithm is capable of effectively extracting them <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 29)</ref>. For a more general search for eclipsing binaries, however, the combination of the BLS along with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis will be required c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000-000 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 29</ref>. The percentage of stars where a 10 mmag test eclipse superimposed on the real lightcurve was successfully returned as the strongest signal by the BLS algorithm. Each epoch of each star was examined separately and only those that returned the test signal within 0.04 days were considered successes. Detection of a harmonic was not considered a success. This graph thus represents the chance of detecting a transiting 'Hot Jupiter' for stars of a given magnitude for the range of periods shown. The stars tested were those with a declination between -10 degrees and 40 degrees and having a weighted mean magnitude within 0.05 magnitudes of the points shown. The trial periods ranged from 0.5 to 9.5 days in half-day steps. The dip in success rates at 6.5 days is the result of many stars having parts of their lightcurve masked out to avoid contamination by solar activity, whilst the dip at 9.5 days is the result of fewer stars remaining in the field of view for long enough for a period of this length to be checked. The small increases in success rates for fainter stars at these periods are due to artificial trends associated with the length of an epoch, which also contributes to an increase in the number of false positives for brighter stars although this number is small compared to the decreases observed for the above reasons. The best substellar candidate so far extracted has a period of 2.4238 days and a host star of magnitude 7.5: a 25 mmag transit is detectable with 5 Ïƒ significance at this level.</p><p>in order to extract a high proportion of these objects ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  11</ref>). The Stetson index can be used as a measure of noise, as well as variability, although it does rate some Algol type binaries very highly so extreme values are not necessarily false positives ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref>. . Additional findings will be reported in due course.</p></div>

Right ascension and declination are given in degrees. Primary eclipse depth and weighted mean magnitude are both in units of magnitudes. Periods are in units of days. The Box-Least-Squares (BLS) signal detection efficiency (SDE), the peak power from a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis and the Stetson variability index are all arbitrary scalar units.

The alternative nearby star is the identity of a nearby star that might be the source of the eclipses, rather than the closest star (this frequently occurs due to the 70 arc-second per pixel resolution of STEREO/HI-1A, as well as being due to nearby bright eclipsing binaries). The Known EB is a binary flag set to 1 if either star is recorded as showing eclipses and 0 otherwise.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
