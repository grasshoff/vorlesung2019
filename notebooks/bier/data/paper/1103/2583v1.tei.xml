				<p>A multi-fluid model for an atomic hydrogen-proton mixture in the upper atmosphere of extrosolar planet is presented when the continuity and momentum equations of each component have been already solved with an energy equation. The particle number density, the temperature distribution and the structure of velocity can be found by means of the model. We chose two special objects, HD 209458b and HD 189733b, as discussion samples and the conclusion is that their mass loss rates predicted by the model are in accordance with those of observation. The most important physical process in coupling each component is charge exchange which tightly couples atomic hydrogen with protons. Most of the hydrogen escaping from hot Jupiters is protons, especially in young star-planet system. We found that the single-fluid model can describe the escape of particles when the mass loss rate is higher than a few times 10 9 g/s while below 10 9 g/s the multi-fluid model is more suitable for it due to the decoupling of particles. We found that the predicted mass loss rates of HD 189733b with the assumption of energy-limit are a factor of 10 larger than that calculated by our models due to the high ionization degree. For the ionized wind which is almost compose of protons, the assumption of energy-limit is no longer effective. We fitted the mass loss rates of the ionized wind as a function of F U V by calculating the variation of the mass loss rates with UV fluxes.</p>

For the former, all of these models describe the thermal particle escape. For the latter, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Erkaev et al. (2005) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holmström et al. (2008)</ref> brought forward loss of nonthermal neutral atoms due to interaction between the stellar wind and the exosphere (more details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ekenbäck et al. 2010</ref>). The model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Erkaev et al. (2005)</ref> underestimates evidently the particle loss rates, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ekenbäck et al. (2010)</ref> modeled the production of neutral hydrogen and match the feature of Lyα absorption. It is not easy to distinguish which process dominates Lyα absorption more. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ben-Jaffel &amp; Hosseini (2010)</ref> found that either energetic HI of stellar origin or thermal HI populations in the planetary atmosphere could fit Lyα observations. <ref type="bibr">Koskinen et al. (2010)(K10)</ref> used an empirical model to analyze UV transit depths, and their results showed that observations can be explained solely by absorption in the upper atmosphere while the process of charge exchange could not be necessary. It is also noteworthy that the properties of planetary magnetic field are unclear until now. Thus, it is important for both thermal models and nonthermal models to calculate self-consistently the deflection distance around planet by using magnetohydrodynamics models.</p><p>The observations of transit in hot jupiters have found that the mass loss rates are in the range 10 9 − 10 11 g/s (VM03; <ref type="bibr">Linsky et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2010</ref>). The effect of evaporation has been used to research the evolution of exoplanet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baraffe et al. (2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe et al. ( , 2005</ref>) considered the effect of mass loss on the evolution of exoplanet, and mass loss rates varying from 10 −12 M J /year to 10 −8 M J /year are obtained from their calculations.</p><p>However, an escape rate 10 2 lower than <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baraffe's(2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe's( , 2005</ref>) is found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hubbard et al. (2007a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hubbard et al. ( , 2007b</ref>. Their results showed that the moderate mass loss rates could be more appropriate for the mass function of observation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guo (2010)</ref> further investigated the influence of mass loss on the tidal evolution of exoplanets, and found that the effect of mass loss on tidal evolution can not be neglect for those planets with initial mass &lt; 1M J and initial orbital distance &lt; 0.1AU. It has also suggested that evaporation can lead to a significant modification to the nature of planet so as to form the planetary remnants (Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr">Etangs et al. , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Davis &amp; Wheatley 2009</ref>).</p><p>At present, theoretical models focus on macroscopic material escape and the photochemistry is incorporated in their models <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yelle 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tian et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Garcia-Munoz 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>). All of these models suggested that the EUV and X-ray energy input by host stars is the main energy source for the escape of atmosphere. However, the escape process of different species may be dominated by different physical mechanism, and the winds around exoplanets orbiting their host stars at distant separation could be tenuous. Thus it must be argued whether the heavier species decouple from the light elements in tenuous winds (OI and CII transit depths of 13% and 7.5% obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vidal-Madjar et al. (2004)</ref> indicated that both Oxygen and Carbon in the atmosphere of HD 209458b are lost.). Moreover, a detailed physical model is helpful probably to distinguish the origin of hydrogen around HD 209458b. Because much micro-physics has not included into hydrodynamic simulations, the study to the behaviors of species by using multi-fluid models may be worthwhile.</p><p>With consideration of the process radiative transfer, this paper aims to calculate planetary atomic hydrogen and proton loss rates through the solution to their mass, momentum and energy equations. A great deal of microscopic physics processes are covered in the mass and momentum equations (Section 2.1). The code is designed for ordinary equations with one or more critical points (Section 2.2). We use Henyey method to calculate these equations (Section 2.4). The results are presented in Section 3. Of especial interest are what makes atomic Hydrogen and proton decoupling (Section 4.1)? In Section 4.2 we discuss the properties of ionized wind and fit the mass loss rate as a function of UV flux.</p><p>We summarize my results in Section.5</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Boundary conditions</head><p>Six boundary conditions are necessary to solve equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(1)</ref>- <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">(3)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(12)</ref>. At the bottom of the flow, we set T 0 = 1000K. Here the particle densities are assumed to be n h + n p = ρ 0 /m H . According to the model of Murray-Clay et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(2009)</ref> we assumed that the value of density is 4 × 10 −13 g/cm 3 . In the bottom regions the collisions between atomic hydrogen and proton are frequent, thus we assumed u h = u p . We need additional three boundary conditions to close the set of equations. Two boundary conditions are provided by the regularity condition. These conditions can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">dH i dr = j ( ∂H i ∂y j )( ∂y j ∂r ) = 0.

However, in calculations we find that these conditions will result in numerically unstable. When the total number of mesh points is increased the approximate conditions du k /dr = 0 (k=h,p) can be used successfully to substitute Equation (17)( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nobili &amp; Turolla 1988</ref>). For the last boundary conditions we assumed the optical depth τ h c = 0.0023 in the sonic points of atomic hydrogen, which implies that τ h c equals the optical depth between the sonic point and Roche lobe <ref type="bibr">(Murray-Clayet et al. 2009</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">HD 209458b</head><p>In this section we applied our model to a typical and particular planet sample:  with the assumption of the same temperature in both particles, the sonic point extends to outside of the wind. The velocity of H and H + is almost same. When one particle travels outward, the other particle drags it inward. The collision between two particles leads to a tight couple for their kinetics.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">HD</formula><p>We have described the photoionization, recombination and charge exchange rates in Section 2.1. Evidently, charge exchange dominates the other two collision process (nγ rce ≫ γ pho , γ rec ). To show the effect of charge exchange we calculate a model without charge exchange (In fact, we encounter numerical problems when the charge exchange is fully neglected. Thus we remain the term and multiply the term by a factor of 10 −3 .).</p><p>Figure 2 displays that protons decouple from atomic hydrogen. If the most important process is neglected, the behavior of each particle looks like a single "fluid".</p><p>Note that the ratios of two velocity components decline with the increase of radius but they rise at a point again. The phenomenon can be explained by the behavior of photoionization and recombination rates. At the inner of the wind, the amount of momentum transferred by the process of photoionization and recombination is not enough, therefore neutral hydrogen decouple from protons. With the decrease of optical depth and temperature, the effect of photoionization and recombination rates on transferring momentum increases at the outer of the wind so that the value of u h /u p also increases. A similar phenomenon will be discussed in Section 4.1.</p><p>The mass loss rates are defined as Our calculation results show that the particle number density at the radius (R ∼ 2.9R p )</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">˙ M = 4πm H ((r h c ) 2 n h u h + (r p c ) 2 n p u p )<label>(21)</label></formula><p>is n = 5 × 10 6 cm −3 . A significant difference between their model and ours is that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in their models. Our results show that the sonic points of H and H + are at 2.57R p and 3.67R p , respectively. It means that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is not unacceptable in the region range from 1R p to 2.57R p .</p><p>However, the number density distribution could be different due to the difference in physical detail. For example, our results that about 60% hydrogen is ionized at 2.9R p do not support the assumption of K10 that the atmosphere is mostly ionized above 2.9R p . In addition, in the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium the profile of number density is flatter than that of hydrodynamics, which can lead to high optic depth in the wings of line.</p><p>It is convenient to define the mass loss rates of neutral hydrogen and protons as</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">˙ M h,p = 4πm H ((r h,p c ) 2 n h,p u h,p ).<label>(22)</label></formula><p>Our results indicate that the mass loss rates of neutral hydrogen and protons are 3.4 × 10 10 g/s and 5.6 × 10 10 g/s, respectively.</p><p>To fit the observations of HD 209458b, two scenarios can supply a satisfactory fit. In the first case, thermal hydrogen atoms are enough to be used to fit the lyman alpha transit profile so that the energetic atoms are not necessary. In the second case, superthermal by XMM-Newton. Because the orbital distance of HD 189733 is 1.5 times closer to its host star than that of HD 209458b, the planet receives X-ray radiation which is 300 times more  erg/cm 2 /s. The mass loss rate is sensitive to UV flux received from its host star. Lecavelier des <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etangs et al. (2010)</ref> found that the escape rate between 10 9 to 10 11 g/s can fit Lyman α absorption of observation. However, we find that a value of 10 9 g/s can be obtained only when the UV flux decreases to 10 3 erg/cm 2 /s which is one order of magnitude smaller than the lower limit of observed value (1σ level). If the value of F U V is 10 4 erg/cm 2 /s, the mass loss rate of HD 189733 is 2.4 × 10 10 g/s.</p><p>In contrast to the results of HD 209458b, as much as 80% of hydrogen at R = 1.2R p is ionized and the wind is almost fully ionized outside R = 1.6R p . The mass loss rate of neutral hydrogen is only of the order of magnitude of 10 8 g/s due to the photoionization of strong UV irradiation form host star (The number density of H is of the order of magnitude of 10 6 cm −3 at R = 1.6R p for the model of F U V = 5 × 10 4 erg/cm 2 /s. The corresponding temperature at the radius is 11000k.).

For the planet HD 209458b we do not find significant differences between the results of multi-fluid model with that of single-fluid model. In most cases the very close-in planets are bathed by strong XUV radiation from their host stars. The species of gas are tightly coupled by collisions so that the description of single-fluid is accurate. But, under certain special circumstances the description of single-fluid should be revisited or substituted, for example, when the planetary wind is tenuous or the irradiation from star is weak. For high number density, the frictional force is able to transfer sufficient momentum from one species to other species.</p><p>However, decrease in the number density may lead to lowering in the frictional force, i.e. decoupling is possible.</p><p>The case is modeled by the method mentioned in this paper in order to discuss the possibility of the decoupling for H and H + . <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the ratios of two velocity components for HD 209458b and HD 189733b in their standard models. Neutral and ionized hydrogen have the same velocity over whole region. In order to test, HD 209458b and HD 189733b are moved to two times their original separations, namely, a = 0.1 and 0.06AU, and other parameters are retained. Seen from <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, both the particles remain the same velocity profile. We also note that the number densities of particles only lower a factor of 2</p><p>than that of standard model.</p><p>The conclusion that even at large separation the description of single-fluid is still real seems to be drawn. However, it must be noticeable that the star HD 189733 is younger than The conclusion is also verified by testing other cases. In order to decrease the mass loss rate of HD 209458b, we artificially increased the mass of the planet as 0.85M p and decreased the density of lower boundary by a factor of 10. The results show that ionized hydrogen has a higher velocity profile and a clear decoupling occurs throughout the wind.</p><p>Finally, we obtained a mass loss rate of ˙ M = 5 × 10 8 g/s.</p><p>In order to obtain a common flow, the momentum gained by one species should be shared by other species. This requires that the characteristic time scale for slowing down the fast particle by interaction with the other slow particle should be smaller than the time </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">γ ′ pho = γ pho /n p , γ ′ rec = γ rec /n p and γ ′ rce = γ rce cm 3 s −1 .</formula><p>number density of neutral hydrogen is about 10 4 − 10 5 cm −3 . Due to the n p /n h ∼ 10, the critical mass loss rate is at the order of magnitude of 10 9 g/s.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the ratios of two velocity components behave as parabolic curves. To maintain the common flow, a sufficient amount of momentum must be transferred between two components. The most important process of transferring momentum is charge exchange. Near the bottom of the wind, the wind is relatively dense so that the process of momentum exchange is effective. However, with the increase of radius the rate of charge exchange decreases (The solid line at the bottom of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.). Thus, the transfer of momentum is also decrease with radius. We note that the process of photoionization and recombination can also redistribute momentum from one component to the other component, and the variations of photoionization and recombination rates (dashed and dotted lines) are contrary to that of charge exchange rate. Therefore, at the outer of the wind the momentum transfered by photoionization and recombination also plays a role.</p><p>Finally, there is minimum value of u h /u p in the middle of wind.</p></div>

The mass loss rates of energy deposition tightly depend on the fluxes of XUV radiation. In general young stars can radiate more energy than old ones in XUV band. The energy-limit mass loss rate can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">˙ M = 3ηβ 3 F s GρK(ξ)<label>(23)</label></formula><p>where β is the ratio of the expansion radius R1 to the planetary radius R p , R1 is altitude where the XUV radiation is absorbed, R p represents the distance form the center of planet Based on the hydrodynamic model of <ref type="bibr">Watason et al.

(2003)</ref> estimated β = 3, but it could be unit according to recent hydrodynamic models which showed that the expansion radius could be 1 -1. For comparison with the energy-limited mass loss rate, we calculated the mass loss rate of HD 189733b as a function of UV flux and the results is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 6</ref> (left panel).</p><p>The mass loss rates given in our models are a factor of 3-10 lower than those calculated by Equation (23) at the assumption of k(ξ) = 1 and η = 0.1 − 0.25. For completeness we also calculated the single-fluid model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>) and found a systemic difference in comparing with the mass loss rates predicted by the model of this paper. For single-fluid model, it can predict a comparable value for ˙ M when the heating efficiency in the energy-limit method is decreased to η = 0.1 (the left panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig.6</ref>). However, this is not consistent with our results. The mass loss rates calculated by single-fluid model is still higher than these of our model. With the increase of F U V , the ratios of ˙ M single / ˙ M thispaper decrease from 5(F U V =450) to 2.5(F U V = 10 5 ). As discussed in Section 3.2, our results fit the observations well. Thus, a lower heating efficiency is required for high ionized wind.</p><p>Our calculation results show that the winds are highly ionized and almost composed of protons even if the UV fluxes are assumed at a low level. The high ionization degree can be explained as the consequence of low mass loss rate. Even if the UV flux is at same level, the mass loss rate of HD 189733b should be lower than that of HD 209458b due to the larger potential well of HD 189733b. Thus, for HD 189733b, the low mass loss leads to the low optical depth and high ionization degree. Given the energy equation, it is clear that the photoionization heating is proportional to the number density of neutral hydrogen.</p><p>With the assumption of energy-limit most of the UV radiation energy is deposited as heat (due to the low ionization degree), which is used to lift material out of the gravitational potential well. Thus, the condition of energy-limit results in higher mass loss rates. In </p><formula xml:id="formula_25">˙ M ∝ F 0.9 U V ; at high flux ˙ M ∝ F 0.6 U V )</formula><p>, and an almost isothermal wind is predicted. In contrast to the case of radiation-recombination-limit, our results show a "normal" temperature profile. It hints that heating is balanced by PdV work rather than radiation cooling. Thus, we can summarize that the modified energy-limit approach can be used in the case of low or moderate ionization degree, but is unsuccessful for the high ionization winds. The conclusion can be validated by comparison with HD 209458b, we find that the mass loss rate calculated by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_24">(23)</ref> can predict a reasonable observation value for HD 209458b.</p><p>The interesting results motivated us to fit the mass loss rate as a function of UV flux in the case of ionized wind. Seen from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Figure 6</ref>, it is clear that the straight line can depict the lower part, and the upper part can be fitted by using a polynomial (a jump appears at F U V = 2000).

Because the left term of inequality <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">(26)</ref> is smaller than the right term, the wind of HD 209458b is not ionized.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The effect of magnetic field</head><p>Many planets in our solar system have magnetic fields of their own. For example, the magnetic field at the surface of Jupiter is about 4.3G. What role the magnetic field plays on the upper atmosphere depends on their field strength. For the planets without intrinsic magnetic fields, the magnetic fields could be induced at the interaction area between the stellar and planetary winds. However, the occurrence of strong magnetic fields occurring at the surfaces of planets can lead to significant changes in the upper atmospheres of planets. The most important effect of magnetic field on the hydrodynamic escape is whether the magnetic field can change the locations of sonic points for different species. If the boundary of magnetosphere is greater than that of sonic point, the planet can still emit a transonic wind. Otherwise, the planetary wind will be suppressed to subsonic flow, even quenched. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Grieβmeier et al. (2004)</ref> have estimated the stand off distance of magnetosphere, R s , by pressure balance and found that the stand-off distance of HD 209458b are about 2.6-3.8 R p which varied with different rotation velocities. Our results show that the locations of sonic points of H and H + are comparable with the distance of stand-off. As discussed previously(Section 3.1), the flow of atomic hydrogen could be transonic, but the escape of proton could be suppressed to subsonic flow. However, seen from Equations (2),(3), <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">(7)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(8)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">et al. 2009</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have developed a multi-fluid model to describe the particle escape from the upper atmosphere of close-in planet. The continuity and momentum equations for each component were solved together with an energy equation. Detailed micro-physical process, for example, photoionization, recombination and charge exchange, have been included in our models.</p><p>Based on Henyey method, the code can treat systems of ordinary differential equations with one, or more, critical points.</p><p>We calculated two samples of close-in planet, HD 209458b and HD 189733b. Our calculations show that the mass loss rates of two planets are of the order of magnitude of 10 10 − 10 11 g s −1 which agree with the observed mass loss rates of 10 10 − 10 11 g s −1 . By detailed test and verification, we found that the most important physical process in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter is charge exchange which tightly couples atomic hydrogen with protons. Most of the hydrogen escaping from hot Jupiters is protons, especially in young star-planet system. Thus, the transit of Lyman-α in HD 189733b could be induced by other unknown physics processes.</p><p>In the assumption of single-fluid all species must remain collide frequently. Otherwise, the description of single-fluid can not be used. Our method can be further apply to other case, for example, the tenuous wind. It is found that decoupling may occur if the mass loss rates are lower than 10 9 g/s.</p><p>We also found that the assumption of energy-limit is not appropriate for ionized winds.</p><p>Our model predicted a mass loss rate lower than that of energy-limit. By calculating the variations of mass loss rate with UV fluxes we fitted the mass loss rates of ionized wind as a function of F U V .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>Eqs. 15 and 16) for proton and atomic hydrogen, respectively.

The upper limit on the observed orbital eccentricity is 0.028(Ibgui &amp; Burrows 2009), so we assumed a circular orbit in the calculations. The mass of host star is 1M ⊙ . The results for HD 209458b are shown and the single-fluid results of Murray-Clay et al. (2009) are also plotted in Fig.1. Seen from Fig.1 clearly, except for a detailed difference, the multi-fluid model predicts much the same trends of temperature, velocity and particle number density as the single-fluid model does. The number density of atomic hydrogen decreases (upper left of Fig. 1) and the ionization fraction increases with radius (lower right of Fig. 1). The fact that as much as 80% of hydrogen at R = 5R p is ionized is a consequence of being irradiated by host star. With the increase of radius the optical depth becomes smaller, even near to zero, thus the radiation from star can freely penetrate the wind and ionize particles. Current studies show the wind temperature can attain 8000-10000K at about 2R p (Yelle 2004; Tian et al. 2005; Garcia Munoz 2007; Penz et al. 2008; Murray-Clay et al. 2009) and our results also verify the fact. The cooling by radiation and PdV work make the temperature reduced from 8000K and decrease to about 5000K in the upper atmosphere. The inversion of temperature in the upper atmosphere is a typical feature of planetary atmosphere. To compare our results with the results of other hydrodynamic models (Yelle 2004; Tian et al. 2005; Garcia Munoz 2007; Penz et al. 2008 and Murray-Clay et al. 2009), we found that all models obtain similar temperature profiles besides the model of Tian et al. (2005) which predicts a monotonously increasing temperature profile and a higher velocity structure. A possible reason is that Tian et al.(2005) applied a higher radiative heating.</figDesc></figure>

Superthermal hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere can be formed via the absorption of stellar UV radiation(Shematovich 2010). As hydrogen atoms have an excess of kinetic energy, they could be locally thermalized with the surrounding particles if the density of atmosphere is enough high. But, at the upper atmosphere, superthermal hydrogen atoms may escape from the atmosphere due to their excess of kinetic energy. A mass loss rate of 3.4 × 10 9 g/s lower than the observational value for HD 209458b has been estimated by Shematovich (2010), and their results shown that those superthermal hydrogen atoms have velocities which are about 20 km s −1 . Therefore, it is unlikely that superthmrmal hydrogen atoms can explain the observed velocities at the wing of line. Note that the location of transition from H 2 to H is about 1.1R p (Yelle 2004; also refer Shematovich 2010), this hints that there superthermal hydrogen atoms can not directly escape from the atmosphere of planet, but they must exchange energy and momentum with cool background particles in large-scale ranges. Exactly, the influence of superthremal hydrogen should be included into future hydrodynamic model. 3.2. HD 189733b HD 189733b is the second extrasolar planet whose atmospheric evaporation has been detected (Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2010). According to observations, they constrain the escape rate of atomic hydrogen to be between 10 9 to 10 11 g/s and EUV flux is 10-40 times the solar value, namely, F EU V ≃ 1 − 4 × 10 4 erg/cm 2 /s. The value may be changed to 2.5 − 10 × 10 4 erg/cm 2 /s if the emission of H I Lyα is also included. The observed value has been validated by X-ray observations. The luminosities of HD 209458 and HD 189733 in X-ray are measured as log L x = 26.12 and log L x = 28.18 erg/s (Sanz-Forcada et al. 2010)</figDesc></figure>

If assume that the flux in X-ray is proportional to UV flux, HD 189733b receives a UV flux of F HD19733b = F HD209458b × 300 ∼ 10 5 erg/cm −2 /s. The planet has a mass M p = 1.13M J , radius R p = 1.16R J and the semi-major axis a = 0.03AU (Bakos et al. 2006; Winn et al. 2007; Southworth 2010). The mass of its host star is 0.8M ⊙ (Nordström et al. 2004). Comparing with HD 209458b, the mass of HD189733b is 1.7 times larger than that of HD 209458b, and its radius is smaller. This means that the potential well of HD 189733b is about twice deeper than that of HD 209458b. Thus, the effect of strong X-ray flux can be balanced to a certain extent by its lager potential well.</figDesc></figure>

If the age of HD 189733 is same as that of HD 209458, the conclusion may be different. For testing such a theoretical hypothesis, we calculated many cases with different values of F U V for HD 189733b. Seen from Figure 5, there exists a critical mass loss rate below which decoupling can occur (We assumed that decoupling would occur when u h /u p is smaller than 95% in the calculations.).
