				<p>The increasing number of spectra gathered by spectroscopic sky surveys and transit-ing exoplanet follow-up has pushed the community to develop automated tools for atmospheric stellar parameters determination. Here we present a novel approach that allows the measurement of temperature (T eff), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and gravity (log g) within a few seconds and in a completely automated fashion. Rather than performing comparisons with spectral libraries, our technique is based on the determination of several cross-correlation functions (CCFs) obtained by including spectral features with different sensitivity to the photospheric parameters. We use literature stellar parameters of high signal-to-noise (SNR), high-resolution HARPS spectra of FGK Main Sequence stars to calibrate T eff , [Fe/H] and log g as a function of CCFs parameters. Our technique is validated using low SNR spectra obtained with the same instrument. For FGK stars we achieve a precision of σ T eff = 50 K, σ log g = 0.09 dex and σ [Fe/H] = 0.035 dex at SNR = 50, while the precision for observation with SNR 100 and the overall accuracy are constrained by the literature values used to calibrate the CCFs. Our approach can be easily extended to other instruments with similar spectral range and resolution, or to other spectral range and stars other than FGK dwarfs if a large sample of reference stars is available for the calibration. Additionally, we provide the mathematical formulation to convert synthetic equivalent widths to CCF parameters as an alternative to direct calibration. We have made our tool publicly available.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The advent of large-scale high-resolution spectroscopic surveys aimed at characterizing the properties of thousands to millions of stars, such as The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE, Majewski, APOGEE <ref type="bibr">Team &amp; APOGEE-2 Team 2016)</ref>, the Gaia-ESO survey, and The GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zucker et al. 2012</ref>), has pushed the community towards the development of pipelines to automatically determine the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances of stars. Methods based on multivariate analyses relying on neural networks and machine learning are under constant improvement (see or example <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xiang et al. 2017</ref> and references therein), alongside the more classical approaches of matching the observed spectrum with a library of observed</p><p>Corresponding authors: e-mail: luca.malavolta@unipd.it <ref type="bibr">(LM)</ref> (e. g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yee, Petigura &amp; von Braun 2017)</ref> or synthetic spectra (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Endl &amp; Cochran 2016</ref> and Allende Prieto 2016 for a detailed review) or relying on the contrast or equivalent widths ratios of several spectral lines (e. g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Teixeira et al. 2016)</ref> A widespread approach to measure the radial velocity (RV) of a star consists in cross-correlating the observed spectrum with a list of spectral lines in the wavelength restframe. It is reasonable to assume that the resulting crosscorrelation function (CCF) reflects the mean shape of the observed spectral lines in the CCF list, which in turn depend on the photospheric parameters of the star. In fact, a similar path based on autocorrelation functions has been already followed in the past by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ratnatunga &amp; Freeman (1989)</ref> and later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beers et al. (1999)</ref> to estimate the metallicity of a large sample of stars. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to quickly and reliably measure effective temperature T eff , gravity log g, and metallicity <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> of a star by simply determining the CCF of its spectrum, when the cho-sen spectral lines are selected according to their sensitivity to the photospheric parameters.</p><p>The main advantage of the CCF approach is that no stellar continuum normalization of the spectrum under analysis is required, thus removing one of the most daunting and uncertain steps in photospheric parameter estimation (e. g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Malavolta et al. 2014</ref>). Our approach can deliver accurate and precise parameters for FGK main sequence stars within a few seconds and without any human intervention.</p><p>This paper is organized as follow. After a brief review of the so-called numerical CCF technique, we derive an analytical formulation to link the CCF with the equivalent width (EW) of the individual lines used to build the CCF. We then introduce our method to calibrate the area of the CCF with respect to stellar atmospheric parameters from highresolution and high SNR HARPS and HARPS-N spectra, obtained in both cases by co-addition of several exposures at lower SNR with these instruments. Two different calibrations are presented. The first calibration is purely empirical and it provides effective temperature and metallicity from the observed CCF area for stars with parameters within the ranges T eff [4500, 6500] K, log g [4. <ref type="bibr">2, 4.8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> [−1.0, 0.5], i. e., solar-type stars. The second calibration is based on the transformation of synthetic equivalent widths of ionized elements into CCF areas and it allows the determination of gravity. Finally we validate the performance of our technique using the individual, low SNR exposures of each star obtained for exoplanet-search purposes, and determine the precision on the atmospheric parameters as a function of SNR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CROSS-CORRELATION FUNCTION USING A NUMERICAL MASK</head><p>The CORAVEL-type cross-correlation function, or numerical CCF ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baranne et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pepe et al. 2002)</ref>, consists in the numerical transposition of the optical cross-correlation made by instrument like CORAVEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baranne, Mayor &amp; Poncet 1979)</ref>, and it has been used in countless studies to measure the RVs of stars (e. g., De Medeiros et al. <ref type="bibr">2014</ref> and references therein). The core of this technique resides in a binary mask where only the wavelength of the spectral lines to be included in the CCF computation have non-null values; the CCF is computed step by step for each point of the RV space by multiplying, in the wavelength space, the observed spectrum with the binary mask (shifted to the RV of the sampling point), and then integrating the result. Following this definition, the outcome is a CCF where the minimum corresponds to the most likely RV of the star (e. g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mayor &amp; Queloz 1995 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malavolta et al. 2015)</ref>. A HARPS extracted spectrum is not usually ready for the CCF determination and some precautions must be taken in order to ensure that different exposures of a given star result in CCFs with the same characteristic parameters, after correcting for the observed radial velocity of the star. This is particularly true in our case, since we want to compare CCF parameters such as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) and the depth (also referred to as contrast) from different stars, and we must be sure that observed differences in the CCF parameters are intrinsic to the star and not due to the different observing conditions. The preparatory steps required before computing the CCF are described in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PREPARING THE SPECTRA FOR THE CCF</head><p>The artifacts affecting a stellar spectrum can be divided in two main categories, i. e., the different observing conditions that affect the stellar light before entering the instrument, and the imprinting of the instrument itself on the observed spectrum. Instrumental effects are corrected by taking calibration images such as bias, dark and spectra of featureless sources, e. g., an halogen lamp. Nowadays modern data reduction pipelines perform this step automatically.</p><p>Changes in the observational conditions can affect the scientific outcome in many subtle ways. For example, due to differential refraction the position of the star in the focal plane of the telescope differs depending of its wavelength, with the effect getting worse at increasing airmass. To compensate for this effect, modern telescope are provided with atmospheric dispersion correctors (ADC) which uses tabulated data to correct for the expected diffraction at telescope focus. Differences between tabulated and effective refraction at observing time will still introduce a variation of the spectral distribution (or simply spectral slope) of the stellar continuum. Additionally, the presence of aerosols or dust in the air, which absorption optical depth decreases with wavelength, can change the slope of the continuum by decreasing the SNR on the blue side of the spectrum.</p><p>Generally speaking, any effect that causes a variation of the spectral distribution will alter the CCF simply because less weight will be given to those lines that have suffered flux loss. Spectral reduction pipelines (such the Data Reduction Software of HARPS and HARPS-N) use a few standard templates to calibrate the flux distribution, but the choice of the template is usually left to the observer. When a star is observed to measure planet-induced RV variations, the only prerequisite is that all the observations should be corrected with the same arbitrary template. In this work we are looking for variations in the CCF as a function of the stellar parameters, so we must ensure that all the observations have been corrected for spectral distribution variations in an homogeneous way.</p><p>We decided to use a synthetic spectrum with Solar parameters as the reference template to determine the spectral slope function a for a given observation (the detailed algorithm is described in Section 4). This function describes the difference in spectral distribution of the star with respect to the reference template, and at the same time it compensate for variations in the spectral slope due to changing observational conditions. We denote with fs a stellar spectrum f that has been corrected for the spectral slope, and with c and cs the two functions required to normalize f and fs respectively to unitary flux over 1 ˚ A, as commonly done before performing equivalent width measurements.</p><p>After spectral slope correction, the continuum function cs of the science spectrum is related to the template fluxcalibrated continuum ct through a scaling factor m, which is simply the ratio between the template flux and the corrected science flux at the reference wavelength λ ref (Equation 1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">cs(λ) = mct(λ) m = fs(λ ref ) ft(λ ref ) = a(λ) * f (λ ref ) ft(λ ref )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>As a consequence, the stellar continuum function is given by Equation (2).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c(λ, p) = mct(λ)/a(λ)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The advantage of using the factor m and Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> is that now there is no need to determine the local continuum of the observed spectrum in order to compute the CCF from spectra obtained with varying observing conditions. Since the continuum normalization is the most difficult task in the analysis of low SNR spectrum, the advantage is considerable. The drawback is that now the obtained values will depend on the goodness of the spectral slope correction in restoring the correct flux as a function of wavelength. This task however can be easily performed, as we will show in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CORRECTION OF SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION VARIATIONS</head><p>Here we describe a general algorithm to bring the observed spectra to a standard reference flux distribution, in order to remove differences between exposures due to changes in observing conditions, as introduced in Section 3. The correction is performed using a spectrum with T eff = 5750 K, log g = 4.5 and [Fe/H] = 0.00 from the synthetic stellar library of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coelho et al. (2005)</ref>. This library provides the continuum stellar flux for each spectrum; it has high resolution spectra (R &gt; 200000) and it covers a wide range of wavelengths (from 300 n m to 1.0 µ m). Any other library with similar characteristics works equally well. The algorithm to obtain the flux correction function a(λ) for an echelle spectrum includes the following steps:</p><p>• Before proceeding, the spectra must be corrected for the blaze function, to remove order-dependent instrumental effects.</p><p>• For each extracted order the average flux for unit wavelength is determined. Integration is performed on the central half of the extracted order (from pixel 1024 to 3072 for HARPS spectra); the mean wavelength between the two integration limits is taken as reference value for the wavelength.</p><p>• The same operation is performed on the template spectrum.</p><p>• The factor m (Equation 1) is obtained by dividing the integrated flux from the reference order (in our case, the order centered on 5500Å5500Å) of the observed spectra by the respective value of the template.</p><p>• The observed-derived values are divided by m and by the respective template-derived values to determine the normalized star-sun ratio for each wavelength step.</p><p>• The correction factor as a function of wavelength is obtained by interpolating the normalized star-template ratios with a B-spline of the 4th order.</p><p>We noticed that some points in our HARPS spectra have a correction factor systematically lower in some wavelength domains, e. g., in the 3900-4000Å4000Å region: this is due to the presence of strong lines (in the mentioned region, the CaII H-K doublet) where the differences between the observed spectra and the template become important; the affected orders are excluded from the fit in the last step. An example of the procedure is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, where the flux correction has been applied to 75 exposures of the star HD125612.</p><p>The resulting function is a combination of the systematic spectral difference between the star and the template, a general trend caused by the wavelength-dependent light loss due to either the telescope (e. g., mirror coating) or the instrument (e. g., CCD sensitivity curve), and small variations resulting from the difference between actual atmospheric refraction effect and the one predicted by the ADC for a given airmass.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">THE LINK BETWEEN THE CCF AND THE EQUIVALENT WIDTH</head><p>Determination of atmospheric parameters is based on the measurement of the equivalent width (EW) of spectral lines, and the numerical CCF is the direct transposition of spectral lines from wavelength to radial velocity space. We need to find an analytical formulation to compute the area subtended by the CCF starting from a set of EWs. Spectral lines on the linear part of the curve of growth are usually approximated with a gaussian shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gray 2005</ref>). An EW is obtained by measuring the depth of a line in the normalized spectrum d (also known as the contrast of the line) and its full width half maximum Γ in the wavelength space. Radial velocities of stars are always well below the relativistic limits (i. e., RVstar &lt; 1000 km s −1 ), so we can use the classical Doppler formula to transpose the EW in the radial velocity space, as in Equation <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">EW = √ 2π 2 √ 2 ln 2 d λ Γ λ = √ 2π 2 √ 2 ln 2 λ0 c dRVΓRV = λ0 c ACCF (3)</formula><p>The normalized area ACCF subtended by the CCF is equivalent to the EW of Equation <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> only when a single line is considered. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pepe et al. (2002)</ref>, the observed CCF is obtained by coadding the individual CCFs from each line in the mask, without a prior normalization for their respective continuum. Consequently the corresponding area ACCF is given by the sum of the areas of each spectral line i in the CCF mask weighted by their continuum levels in the RV space. The value of the continuum level at the center of the CCF (i. e., RV = 0) for a generic line i is obtained by applying the definition of the CCF to the continuum function c(λ) at the wavelength λi corresponding to the center of the spectral line, with δ i λ being the size of the bin used to compute the CCF, as in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 . c i CCF (0) = λ i +δ i λ /2 λ i −δ i λ /2 c(λ)dλ δ λ c(λi)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In a generic case it would be difficult to obtain the integrand from Equation (4). In practice, δ λ is always chosen to be very small compared to the instrumental FWHM, so we can approximate c(λ) as constant between the integration limits. Using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2)</ref> from Section 3, the expected CCF area as a function of the EWs of the spectral lines in the CCF mask can be determined (Equation 5).</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ACCF = i δ i λ c(λi)Ai cCCF(0) = 1 cCCF(0) i δ i λ mct(λi) a(λi) Ai = 1 cCCF(0) i δ i λ mct(λi) a(λi) λi c EWi (5)</formula><p>All the variables in the right side of Equation <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> are known a priori (ct, δ i λ ) or can be obtained by the observations themselves (m, a, cCCF(0) using the sides of the CCF function), while the EW for each line i in the CCF mask can be computed with a spectrum synthesis code. This result allows the determination of the expected CCF area as a function of the atmospheric parameters and the creation of a synthetic calibration. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The integration bin is usually taken constant in the RV space, so in the wavelength space its value depends on the line under analysis </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAMPLE OF STARS</head><p>bf It is essential to have a calibration sample of stars that widely span the range in the stellar parameters that we want to calibrate. At our disposal we have 1111 stars from several HARPS long-term programs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mayor et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lo Curto et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Santos et al. 2011</ref>). Since these stars are the targets of extensive exoplanet search surveys, a large number of exposures have been collected during several years of HARPS operations: this allows us to use the same stars as calibrators when considering the coadded, high SNR spectrum, and as test case when a single low SNR spectrum is under study. Stellar atmosphere parameters have been derived by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adibekyan et al. (2012)</ref> from co-added spectra using classical EW analysis. They employed empirical transition probabilities using Solar spectra as reference, thus making their analysis differential with respect to the Sun. The automatic continuum determination and EW measurements performed with ARES ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sousa et al. 2007</ref>), ensure a high degree of homogeneity in the parameters derived for this sample. The distribution of the atmosphere parameters are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 2</ref>: the sample contains only dwarf stars with log g 4. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>, with a few exceptions. The targets span a wide range in T eff and [Fe/H] without any correlation between the two parameters. A clear trend of micro-turbulence ξt with effective temperature is clearly visible. Since this relationship is well known and has been studied in the past (see for example the calibration of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsantaki et al. 2013</ref>) we will not use the CCFs to derive this parameter. The quoted errors are σT eff = 30 K, σ log g = 0.06 dex and σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> = 0.03 dex on average. These uncertainties are internal of the method and do not include systematic source of errors such as the use of a specific set of stellar atmosphere models or departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LINE SELECTION FOR THE CCF MASKS</head><p>The HARPS Data Reduction Software (DRS) automatically determines an overall CCF and its parameters (central RV, FWHM and contrast) at the end of each exposure using one of the CCF masks provided by the DRS. Each mask contains several thousands of lines chosen among several chemical elements and ionization states and weighted according to the amount of radial velocity information they carry. For example, deep and sharp lines have larger weights simply because their RVs are easier to measure ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pepe et al. 2002)</ref>. Three CCF masks are available, based on synthetic spectra of G2, K5 and M2 dwarf stars, in order to take into account the variation of line depths and flux distribution with the spectral type of the star 2 . Since every line carries information on the radial velocity shift of the star regardless its chemical origin, and the principal goal of the instrument is to measure the differential shift of the star to a precision better than 1m/s, all the available unsaturated lines are included in each mask in order to increase the SNR of the CCF.</p><p>In this work we are pursuing a different goal: to determine a correspondence between the characteristics of the CCF and the atmosphere parameters of the stars. For our purposes, significant noise can be added to the derived relationships by inclusion of lines with unknown atomic parameters or from chemical elements that can have large star-tostar abundance variations. We must make a more stringent selection of the lines included in the CCF mask in order to preserve the relationship between photospheric parameters and CCF characteristics without sacrificing excessively the SNR of the CCF.</p><p>To select a good sample of lines for our mask, we started with the list from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Malavolta et al. (2016)</ref>. This list includes 498 atomic line parameters from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sousa et al. (2011)</ref>, which is in turn an extension of the iron line list from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sousa et al. (2007)</ref>, and several chemical elements from <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Neves et al. (2009)</ref>. Transition probabilities log gf have been updated to match the Solar EWs with the elemental abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). Our results will be then differential with respect to the Sun. We briefly describe the procedure followed to derive the line list. The initial line list, along with the atomic parameters (including an initial estimate of the oscillator strengths) is taken from the VALD4 online database ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Piskunov et al. 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Kupka et al. 2000</ref>) using the solar stellar parameters as input (T eff = 5777 K, log g = 4.44, ξ = 1.0 km s −1 ) in the spectral region from 4500Å4500Å to 6910Å6910Å. The following criteria are followed:</p><p>• Lines must not be strongly blended in the Kurucz Solar Flux Atlas (Kurucz 2005 and references therein).</p><p>• Lines must not be too weak (EW &lt; 5 m ˚ A) or too strong (EW &gt; 200 m ˚ A)</p><p>• Lines must not reside in the wings of strong lines (e. g.Hα, Hβ and MgI lines)</p><p>• EWs measured in the Kurucz Solar Flux Atlas and in the solar reflected light spectrum of the Ceres asteroid (obtained with HARPS) must agree within 10%.</p><p>• EWs of the lines can be appropriately measured using the ARES program ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sousa et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>Finally empirical oscillator strengths are obtained through an inverse analysis with the ewfind driver of the LTE Spectral Synthesis code MOOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sneden 1973</ref>) and the measured EWs from the solar spectrum, assuming for the Sun the parameters listed in Santos, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Israelian &amp; Mayor (2004)</ref>.</p><p>The provided wavelengths are used as input positions by the ARES program to perform a Gaussian fit of the spectral lines in order to derive their EWs. However these wavelengths lack the required precision to be directly used in a cross-correlation mask, i. e., spectral lines are provided with a precision of 0.01Å01Å, corresponding to a potential misplacement of the CCF of 0.545 km s −1 at 5500Å5500Å. We re-determined the central wavelengths of the lines by performing a multi-gaussian fit of each spectral line in the list on several solar spectra observed with HARPS 3 . The new values are already included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> the distributions of the selected lines versus the basic atomic line parameters are displayed. The selected lines are homogeneously distributed in wavelength and cover a good range in excitation potential (EP) and equivalent width as measured in the solar spectrum.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> the measured continuum-normalized area of the CCF determined by the HARPS pipeline (left panel) as a function of effective temperature and metallicity is compared with the CCF area obtained when only FeI lines are used (right panel), for the same set of stars in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. The jump in color in the left panel is due to the mask and flux correction template used for different spectral types, and it is the main reason why we cannot use the CCF information provided by the DRS pipeline. The area of the CCF varies smoothly when it is homogeneously derived for all the star in the sample. In both panels a degeneracy between temperature and metallicity is visible for a given CCF area. Every line depends on both the effective temperature of the photosphere and the abundance of the chemical element that is producing the line, and this behavior is conserved when the lines are co-added into a CCF. It is clear then that a single CCF area is not enough to constrain both metallicity and temperature if available. This is true regardless of the binary mask used for the CCF construction.</p><p>Fortunately, spectral lines react to temperature changes in different ways according to their atomic parameters. In classical stellar atmospheric parameters determination, a key parameter when determining the effective temperature of the star is the excitation potential (EP), i. e., the energy required to excite an atom to a given state from the ground state.</p><p>The presence of a trend between the abundances of individual Fe I lines (directly derived from their EWs) and the excitation potential is a clear sign of an incorrect T eff assumed for the stellar model. The relationship between [h]   temperature and theoretical equivalent widths for lines with different excitation potentials is demonstrated with several examples in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>. For each value of the effective temperature the EWs have been determined using a Kurucz model atmosphere with log g = 4.44, ξt = 1.0 km s −1 and [Fe/H] = 0.00 using the ewfind driver of MOOG. Calculations have been performed for three neutral Fe lines and a ionized one. Helpful analytical expressions for EW curves as functions of temperature, excitation and ionization potentials are derived in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gray (2005)</ref>. We can take advantage of the fact that at a given temperature the EW curve of each line has a different slope, depending on its excitation potential, to create CCF masks whose associated areas have different gradients in the temperature-metallicity plane of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. We split our original linelist into three CCF masks:</p><p>(i) a mask with low excitation potential lines, comprising 243 lines with EP &lt; 3.0 eV ; (ii) a mask with 94 intermediate EP lines (3.0 &lt; EP &lt; 4.0 eV); (iii) a mask with 183 high excitation potential lines (EP &gt; 4.0 eV)</p><p>The list of spectral lines used in this work, their atomic parameters, and their mask membership are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The values obtained with these three mask will be identified respectively by the symbols A low , A med and A high .</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> we can see that the iso-areas lines have different slopes for each mask, with stronger slope variations for cooler stars. As a result, a given combination of CCF areas will identify an unique point in the temperature-metallicity plane, i. e.only a single (T eff , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">MODELING THE TEMPERATURE-METALLICITY PLANE</head><p>In the temperature range of FGK dwarf stars most of the elements are in their first ionization stage, so weak lines formed by neutral elements are insensitive to pressure changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gray 2005</ref>). In the previous section we described CCF masks composed of neutral-species transitions, with which we can derive an empirical calibration for T eff and [Fe/H] which is suitable for dwarf stars (log g 4.4 ± 0.3 dex) without requiring a precise knowledge of stellar gravity. The easiest way to determine T eff and [Fe/H] from the available CCF areas is to calibrate the two parameters as functions of the available CCF Area from high SNR spectra:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T eff = f1(A low , A med , A high ) (6) [Fe/H] = f2(A low , A med , A high )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The two functions f1 and f2 can be represented in any form, i. e., either an analytical function or a list of tabulated values to be interpolated.</p><p>The coefficients of the functions are determined through Least Squares minimization using as input data T eff and [Fe/H] from literature, and the CCF areas of the three masks measured on high SNR spectra.</p><p>The internal precision of the calibration is tested determining T eff and [Fe/H] from the same area values used to determine the function coefficients. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> show the difference between the stellar parameters used to calibrate Equations (6) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(7)</ref> as a function of the measured CCF areas, and the value returned by these functions when the same area values are given as input.</p><p>After exploring several possibilities, we decided to model f1 and f2 with three-dimensional Chebyshev polynomial functions of the first kind of order 6x6x6. The Chebyshev polynomials are defined in the range <ref type="bibr">[−1, 1]</ref>, so the mid-points A mean and range A range for each variable must be chosen a priori. The variable transformation is defined by Equation <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">A = (A measured − A mean )/A range<label>(8)</label></formula><p>This choice led to an internal precision comparable with the spectroscopic formal error of the atmospheric parameters, and the absence of any systematic trend in the residuals. We obtained σT eff = 22 K and σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> = 0.02 dex, against a reported precision of σT eff = 30 K and σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> = 0.03 dex from EW determination.</p><p>Once the coefficients of f1 and f2 have been determined, the only parameters required for T eff and [Fe/H] determination are:</p><p>• the three line-lists in Tables 1;</p><p>• the coefficients of the Functions (6) and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(7)</ref>;</p><p>• the two parameters for each variables needed for Equation (8);</p><p>The CCFs must be computed with the same technique as described in Section 2; since the areas are normalized to the continuum level, the size of the bin in the mask is not relevant. Flux correction plays a major role, since it is changing the weights of single lines when assembling the CCF, and it should be performed as described in Section 4. Note that the general trend of stellar flux correction shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is due to the technical characteristics of the telescope and spectrograph, and can be determined a priori. However, as a consequence the derived photospheric parameters will be affected by a larger uncertainties for not correcting nightby-night deviations from the general flux shape. Generally speaking, the CCFs of the calibration sample and the CCF of a star with unknown parameters must be computed following the same algorithm, to ensure a correct determination of the stellar parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CALIBRATION OF GRAVITY</head><p>In principle, all the lines are sensitive to pressure changes: with increasing density, a larger number of absorbers per volume is available and the atomic lines are stronger. For cool stars however the strengths of neutral lines of most elements do not depend much on gravity, as discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gray (2005)</ref> (see again <ref type="figure">Figures 7 and Figure 8</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, lines arising from the ionized species of most elements are often very dependent on gravity. The rate of ionization of atoms depends on temperature, but the recombination rate is a function of temperature and gravity (Saha equation): recombination reduces the number of ionized atoms and it is faster with increasing pressure (gravity), thus lines from the most ionized states are very sensitive to this parameters.</p><p>In classical EW analyses, an initial guess at gravity is made to determine T eff and [Fe/H] from neutral iron lines. Using the new determinations of the two parameters, the gravity estimate is improved by imposing ionization equilibrium of iron, i. e., the abundance derived from FeII lines must match that from FeI lines. The two steps are repeated until the three parameters converge.</p><p>We can proceed in a similar fashion to calibrate log g as a function of CCF area. Following the approach in Section 7 and Section 8, we define a CCF mask including isolated, unsaturated ionized lines for several elements, taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sousa et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Neves et al. (2009)</ref> and listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> (identified with the mask flag I).</p><p>We firstly attempted to calibrate gravity as a function of the three CCF areas from neutral lines plus the CCF area using ionized lines, as done with T eff and [Fe/H], but the coverage in gravity of our sample was not sufficient to derive a direct calibration of log g, not even when T eff and [Fe/H] were externally provided. Keeping in mind that the CCF area from the ionized lines mask is also a function of temperature and metallicity, we followed this strategy to calibrate log g as a function of A CCF :</p><p>(i) For each star, the CCF area using the ionized line mask A CCF is measured.</p><p>(ii) For each star, the expected CCF area from EWs A EW is determined using Equation (5) and the atmospheric stellar parameters from literature; (iii) The correction factor FC = A CCF /A EW is determined using stars with log g = 4.4 ± 0.1 and modeled with a 2D Chebyshev polynomial function of the first kind (order 2×2) as a function of temperature and metallicity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 9</ref>).</p><p>(iv) For each star, A log g EW is evaluated for a grid of log g values in the range [3.6, 4.9] and step 0.1 dex, as in step (ii).</p><p>(v) A log g EW are rescaled to the expected A log g CCF values by using the function Fc determined in step (iii).</p><p>(vi) For each log g grid point, A log g CCF is modeled as a function of T eff and [Fe/H] with a 2D Chebyshev polynomial (order 3 × 3). for the CCF areas, modeled with the function Fc, is mainly due to the influence of nearby spectral lines which lower the observed CCF continuum but are not taken in account in Equation (5). This explains why the ratio FC is systematically lower than unity and gets lower at cooler temperatures, where spectral lines grow in depth. EWs are calculated using the ewfind driver of MOOG. Following the approach described above, to determine the stellar gravity T eff and [Fe/H] must be provided as input, using for example the values derived in Section 8). The values of A log g CCF computed at T eff and [Fe/H] are then retrieved for each point of the log g grid and interpolated, with log g as a function of ACCF. Finally the gravity value is determined by using the A CCF measured from the spectrum with the ionized lines mask.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The difference between synthetic and observed values</head><p>As done for T eff and [Fe/H] in Section 8, we test the internal precision of the calibration by comparing the derived log g's for the calibrators and the log gEW values from the literature. In the top panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, the difference between these two values ∆log g is plotted against the gravity from literature. A clear trend with the gravity of the star is present, possibly caused by our approach in determining the correction factor FC (T eff , <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>), which appears to be function of log g as well. Since we do not have enough data to calibrate the correction factor as a function of gravity, a different approach has to be taken.</p><p>In the middle panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> the difference between the CCF area determined using the ionized lines mask and the expected synthetic value is plotted as a function of the gravity derived from the CCF area. The red line represents a quadratic fit to the overall trend. The scatter around this line is σ∆A = 0.026, which is around 1 − 2% of the average value of the CCF area. We decided to model such difference as a function of the derived gravity instead of the literature gravity so that we can apply this correction even for star without any a priori knowledge of the gravity. Following this approach, an approximation of gravity is firstly determined using the measured CCF area, the area correction value is determined using the derived value of gravity and added to the previously measured CCF area, and then this corrected value is used to get the final estimate of gravity. The bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> is a replica of the upper panel, with the CCF-derived gravity now determined after applying the model introduced in the middle panel.</p><p>Results for calibrators stars are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> in a similar fashion as done for temperature and metallicity. The dispersion in the residual distribution is of the same order of the average formal error (σ log g = 0.076 dex versus &lt; σ &gt; log g = 0.06 dex), although a residual trend with temperature and metallicity is still present and at higher values of gravity and lower temperatures the calibration seems to Figure 11. As in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, but for gravity be less reliable. While a more complex approach than the one presented in this section should be followed to correct for the systematic deviations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, we note that the amplitude of the residual trend is smaller than the average error of the calibration stars (blue dashed lines in the <ref type="figure">Fig- ure)</ref>, meaning that no real improvement of the results would be obtained. Therefore we preferred to rely on our simpler but more robust approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS AS A FUNCTION OF SNR</head><p>We applied the technique described in the previous sections to each individual exposure obtained with HARPS within the planet-search survey described in Section 6, and compared the outcome with the EW-based atmospheric parameters obtained after stacking together the exposures. These observations have been gathered in different weather condition and sometimes with different integration times, but usually for a given star the observations are clustered around the SNR expected for average observing conditions. The number of observations varies largely from star to star, from a few observations to several hundreds, depending on the specific goal for that target (e. g., characterize its activity rather than discovering new planets). We analyzed a total of 56000 spectra, but we decided to retain for each star a maximum of 10 randomly selected determinations of the atmospheric parameters to better represent the dispersion of the parameters as a function of SNR, i. e., to avoid biasing the plot towards stars with many observations. Temperature and metallicity are derived using the direct calibration introduced in Section 8; gravity is then derived as described in Section 9, using the obtained stellar parameters as input. It is important to notice that these Figure 12. Difference between the CCF-derived atmospheric parameters for individual HARPS spectra and the EW-derived parameters from high-SNR stacked spectra, as a function of the SNR. Temperature and metallicity have been derived using the direct calibration, while for gravity we used the former two parameters as input. Cyan points represent the 1σ dispersion for several bins of SNR. The red line is the inverse square root law fit of the dispersion as a function of the SNR. Blue dashed lines represent the average error from EW-derived parameters.</p><p>calibrations, although very precise, are reliable only in the range of parameters used to derive the functions (6) and <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. To determine the precision as a function of SNR, the σ of the distribution of the difference has been computed for several bins of SNR. At low SNR a simple inverse square-root law of SNR provides a very good fit of the points, proving that our measurements are photon-limited. For SNR = 50 we have a precision of σT eff = 50 K, σ log g = 0.09 dex and σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> = 0.035 dex, while the accuracy of the technique is provided by the accuracy of the atmosphere parameters of the calibrators. The precision of our technique is limited by the goodness of the calibration at a SNR between 100 and 150, so for SNR similar or greater than these values the average error from EW analysis should be considered as an estimate for the associated errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have presented a new technique to quickly determine reliable stellar atmosphere parameters for FGK Main Sequence stars using several CCFs specifically built to be more sensitive to a given atmosphere parameter respect to the others. Our approach relies on a set of high-resolution, high SNR stars already classified spectroscopically, which defines the limit on the accuracy of our technique.</p><p>We have developed this approach with two goals in mind. The first goal is to enable the spectroscopic classification of stellar objects at observing time, a few seconds after the end of the exposure, with a precise tool that is quick and easy to use at the same time. This tool can be extremely useful when performing time series of poorly characterized target, e. g., follow-up of faint planet-host candidates, to exclude stars that do not match a criteria selection (e. g., stars that are not solar-type stars) after one or two observations with a considerable optimization of telescope time.</p><p>The second goal is to determine atmospheric parameters of faint objects observed at very low SNR with high-resolution spectroscopy, when an equivalent width analysis is still not feasible even after co-addition of all the available spectra.</p><p>To find the relationship between CCFs parameters and photosphere parameters we have used a dataset of highresolution, high SNR spectra of 1111 stars with accurate parameters derived using equivalent widths from literature. The spectrum of each star is actually the result of a coaddition of several spectra at lower SNR, since these data have been gathered for exoplanet search. The lower SNR spectra have allowed us to understand the effective precision of our technique on real data.</p><p>Two different calibrations have been presented. The first is purely empirical and it provides temperature and metallicity from the observed CCF areas for stars with parameters in the ranges T eff [4500, 6500] K, log g [4. <ref type="bibr">2, 4.8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> [−1.0, 0.5] (solar-type and slightly evolved stars). We achieve a precision of σT eff = 50 K and σ <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> = 0.035 dex at SNR = 50, with the precision being an inverse square-root law of SNR. The second calibration is based on the transformation of synthetic equivalent width in CCF areas and it allows the determination of gravity when temperature and metallicity are provided as input. For gravity we reach a precision of σ log g = 0.09 dex, with this value taking into account the errors in T eff and <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref> introduced by the empirical calibration. In both cases the precision for HARPS spectra with SNR 100 and the overall accuracy are limited by the set of stars used as reference. Given the very high SNR of the calibration sample, better performance can be achieved by expanding the parameter space covered by the calibration stars, e. g., by including stars at lower metallicity, rather than increasing the number of observations of the stars already in the sample.</p><p>We have developed this open-source tool 4 for HARPS and HARPS-N data and for FGK Main Sequence stars, but our approach can be easily extended to other instruments with similar or larger spectral range and similar resolution, or to other spectral range and stars with different characteristics (e. g., Red Giant Branch stars or M dwarfs) if a large sample of reference stars is available to calibrate the CCFs as a function of photospheric parameters. When either of the two cases above does not apply, we provide the mathematical formulation required to transform synthetic EWs to CCF areas. Our tool will allow an easy, quick and reliable characterization of candidate transiting planets from present and future transit surveys such as NGTS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chazelas et al. 2012</ref>), TESS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ricker et al. 2014</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">PLATO (Rauer et al. 2014</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
