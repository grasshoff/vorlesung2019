				<p>During accretion, terrestrial bodies attain a wide range of thermal and rotational states, which are accompanied by significant changes in physical structure (size, shape, pressure and temperature profile, etc.). However, variations in structure have been neglected in most studies of rocky planet formation and evolution. Here, we present a new code, HERCULES, that solves for the equilibrium structure of planets as a series of overlapping constant-density spheroids. Using HERCULES and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, we show that Earth-like bodies display a dramatic range of morphologies. For any rotating planetary body, there is a thermal limit beyond which the rotational velocity at the equator intersects the Keplerian orbital velocity. Beyond this corotation limit (CoRoL), a hot planetary body forms a structure, which we name a synestia, with a corotating inner region connected to a disk-like outer region. By analyzing calculations of giant impacts and models of planet formation, we show that typical rocky planets are substantially vaporized multiple times during accretion. For the expected angular momentum of growing planets, a large fraction of post-impact bodies will exceed the CoRoL and form synestias. The common occurrence of hot, rotating states during accretion has major implications for planet formation and the properties of the final planets. In particular, the structure of post-impact bodies influences the physical processes that control accretion, core formation and internal evolution. Synestias also lead to new mechanisms for satellite formation. Finally, the wide variety of possible structures for terrestrial bodies also expands the mass-radius range for rocky exoplanets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The physical structure of a planet is essential information that is needed to investigate all major physical processes during planet formation and evolution. The planet's mass, size and shape govern the efficiency of accretion onto the body, and the internal pressure and temperature profiles control the conditions for differentiation and core formation. The vigor of convection and the resulting extent of mixing depends upon the physical structure of the body as well as the driving forces. The energy deposited by giant impacts, a key stage of terrestrial planet formation in our solar system and exoplanetary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chambers, 2010)</ref>, can radically change a body's physical structure. Significant portions of the silicate mantles of the impacting bodies melt or vaporize <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Melosh, 1990)</ref>. In addition, planets can acquire significant angular momentum (AM) via one or more giant impacts ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agnor et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kokubo and Ida, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Most planet formation studies have implicitly assumed that the lifetime of the transiently hot states generated by giant impacts (100's-1000's years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Zahnle et al., 2007</ref>) is short enough to neglect a detailed treatment of partially vaporized rocky bodies. For some aspects of terrestrial planet formation, this assumption may be justified, and most investigations of post-impact processes begin after * Corresponding author: slock@fas.harvard.edu the silicate fraction of a body is fully condensed and the planet has a distinct magma ocean and volatile-dominated atmosphere (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Solomatov, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lebrun et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hirschmann, 2012)</ref>. However, the physical structure of a body in the time period between an energetic impact and a magma ocean can influence a number of different processes, including core formation, the reaccretion of impact debris and the formation of satellites. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the Earth's lower mantle records chemical signatures that predate the last giant impact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rizo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mukhopadhyay, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tucker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Parai et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pet˝ o et al., 2013)</ref>. Ascertaining how such reservoirs survived at least the Moon-forming impact event and persisted to the present day requires an understanding of the range of pressure-temperature conditions generated by giant impacts.</p><p>The physical structures of bodies after giant impacts have not been well studied with the exception of the Earth after the proposed Moon-forming event ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hartmann and Davis, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cameron and Ward, 1976)</ref>. Most studies have assumed that this event set the present AM of the EarthMoon system, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cameron and Ward (1976)</ref>. Detailed studies of giant impact outcomes find that this constraint strongly limits the mass ratio and impact parameters of a potential Moon-forming event <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Canup, , 2008b</ref>. Hence, the canonical model for the Moon-forming giant impact is that of an approximately Mars-mass body obliquely colliding with the proto-Earth near the mutual escape velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Canup, , 2008b</ref>. This specific giant impact is often used to represent all giant impacts. However, impacts similar to the canonical Moon-forming impact represent only a small fraction of the impacts that occur during accretion <ref type="bibr">(Stew- art and Leinhardt, 2012</ref>). Studies of terrestrial planet formation with more realistic collision outcomes have found that giant impacts with much higher specific energies (e.g.,  and AM ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda, 2010)</ref> than the canonical impact are common. The resulting post-impact structures have a correspondingly wide range of thermal and rotational states that can be substantially different from that produced by the canonical Moonforming impact. Furthermore, the canonical impact model for Moon formation is currently under scrutiny because of the difficulty of explaining the isotopic similarity between the Earth and Moon (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Melosh, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burkhardt, 2014)</ref> and the discovery that AM could have been transferred away from the Earth-Moon system since the last-giant impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wisdom and Tian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Tian et al., 2017)</ref>. If the AM of the Earth-Moon system immediately after the event was different than the present day, then a wider range of giant impact scenarios are possible . Thus, a quantitative study of the possible physical structures of hot, rotating rocky bodies is needed.</p><p>Exploring the range of physical structures after giant impacts is particularly important for understanding the mechanisms for terrestrial satellite formation, including the origin of our Moon and its chemical relationship with Earth (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Canup et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wang and Jacobsen, 2016)</ref>. Previous studies of lunar origin have focused on the conditions after the canonical Moonforming impact, which we summarize here. After a canonical impact event, the Earth's spin period would have been ∼5 hrs, which would have produced minor rotational flattening for a fully condensed body. There would have been a large angular velocity discontinuity between the corotating planet and a sub-Keplerian disk. The dynamics of this shear boundary have not been well studied, except to consider possible mixing between the planet and disk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pahlevan and Stevenson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Desch and Taylor, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Melosh, 2014)</ref>. The material that is injected into orbit in canonical style impacts originates primarily from the antipode hemisphere of the impactor and is less shocked than the impacted hemisphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2014)</ref>. As a result, the disk material would have been less vaporized than the planet's predominantly silicate vapor atmosphere, creating a thermodynamic discontinuity between the Earth and the disk (although the disk vapor may have been continuous with the planet's atmosphere; see <ref type="bibr">Pahlevan and Steven- son, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Desch and Taylor, 2013)</ref>. Thus, studies of the system after Earth's last giant impact assume that a dynamically and thermodynamically distinct disk orbits a corotating, nearly spherical central body (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson and Stevenson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Machida and Abe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015)</ref>. Given the possible range of thermal and rotational states produced by giant impacts, it is necessary to explore satellite formation from a range of different post-impact structures.</p><p>The need to understand the physical structures of rocky planets extends beyond accretionary processes. Internal structure models are the primary tool used to infer the possible compositions of exoplanets from mass and radius observations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Valencia et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Seager et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Swift et al., 2012</ref>). Most of the discovered exoplanets fall in a mass and radius range between the rocky and gaseous planets in our solar system <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Morton et al., 2016)</ref>. Hence, most exoplanets are unlike any of the planets in our solar system. In addition, because of the biases in the astronomical techniques used to find them, most of the known exoplanets are close to their stars and have high equilibrium surface temperatures. However, current internal structure models do not consider a wide range of thermal or rotational states, especially for rocky planets. Most exoplanet structure calculations model non-rotating, relatively cold bodies similar to the planets in the present-day solar system (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Valencia et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Swift et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zeng and Sasselov, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Zeng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Unterborn et al., 2016)</ref>. In order to understand the possible range of exoplanet compositions, rocky planet models must be extended to include hot and rotating structures.</p><p>Here, we examine the structure of terrestrial planets over a wide range of thermal and rotational states. We used smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and developed a new code, HERCULES, for calculating the equilibrium structure of bodies based on modeling the body as a series of overlapping spheroids ( §2). We find that there is a wide range of sizes and shapes for hot, rotating bodies ( §3). In particular, we show that there is a limit beyond which a body cannot have a single angular velocity. Beyond this limit, a body can exhibit a range of morphologies with disk-like outer regions. The corotation limit (CoRoL) is a function that depends upon the composition, thermal state, AM and mass of a body ( §4). We show that typical terrestrial planets experience multiple substantially vaporized states during accretion as a result of giant impacts. For the expected range of AM of growing planets, some post-impact states exceed the CoRoL ( §5). The range of possible physical and thermal structures for terrestrial planets has significant implications for understanding physical processes during accretion, for example differentiation and satellite formation, as well as interpreting the composition of exoplanets ( §6). The supporting information includes an extended description of the methods used in this work and data tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>We modeled the equilibrium structure of isolated bodies and the physical states obtained after giant impacts. Isolated bodies were modeled using both SPH simulations and the HERCULES code, a new method for modeling rapidly rotating bodies based on overlapping, concentric, constant-density spheroids. Impact simulations were performed using SPH in a manner similar to prior studies of giant impacts . In this section, we describe both methods and compare the results for isolated, corotating bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Smoothed particle hydrodynamics</head><p>The GADGET-2 SPH code ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Springel, 2005</ref>), modified to include tabulated equations of state (EOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Marcus et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Marcus, 2011)</ref>, was used to calculate both the structure of isolated bodies and to simulate giant impacts. We restricted this work to Earth-like planets, and all planets were modeled as differentiated bodies with 2/3 silicate and 1/3 iron by mass. As in prior work, the metal core and silicate were modeled as pure iron and pure forsterite, respectively. We used the M-ANEOS model <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Melosh, 2007)</ref> to generate the tabulated EOS, which includes two condensed phases and vapor (refer to Supplementary Materials of .</p><p>Non-rotating, isolated bodies were initialized with a given mass and an approximate isentropic thermal profile. The bodies were then equilibrated for 24 hrs with the entropy of the layers imposed at each time step and any particle velocity damped. To produce cold isolated bodies with a mantle entropy of 4 kJ K −1 kg −1 , a constant angular velocity was imposed to particles in a non-rotating body of the same thermal structure. The structure was then equilibrated with the entropy of the layers imposed at each time step but without any damping of velocities. Rotating bodies with hotter thermal states were produced by starting from a colder planet of the same AM and increasing the specific entropy of the mantle at a rate of 0.25 kJ K −1 kg −1 day −1 until the desired specific entropy was reached. Isolated bodies had 10 5 particles, which is comparable to much of the recently published literature on giant impacts using the SPH technique.</p><p>Post-impact states were generated by simulations of giant impacts in the same manner as described in´Cukin´ in´Cuk and Stewart <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>. Briefly, bodies were initialized in hydrostatic equilibrium by forming each body in isolation with isentropic silicate thermal profiles ( §2.3) with silicate specific entropy, S silicate = 3.2 or 4 kJ K −1 kg −1 , corresponding to 1 bar potential temperatures of ∼1900 and ∼3300 K, respectively. Each impacting body was composed of 10 5 to 5 × 10 5 particles. Impact simulations were calculated for 24 to 48 hrs of simulation time, until the change in bound mass was negligible and the post-impact structure reached a quasi-equilibrium shape. The parameters for each simulation are given in <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>. Part of this suite of simulations (116 impacts) was calculated for´Cukfor´ for´Cuk and Stewart (2012) and is primarily composed of small impactors (of mass M p ≤ M Mars ) onto targets with pre-impact rotation. We extended the suite of giant impacts (by 46) to include other proposed Moon-forming scenarios  and to sample the full range of giant impacts found in the later stages of planet formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Raymond et al., 2009;</ref>. Our collection of impact outcomes span a range much broader than those proposed for the terminal impact event on Earth. The final bound masses range from 0.45 to 1.1 Earth masses (M Earth ), but are typically between 0.8 and 1.1M Earth .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The HERCULES code</head><p>We developed a new code for calculating the equilibrium structure of rotating planetary bodies based on describing a body as a series of overlapping, concentric, constantdensity spheroids. A model based on the same principle, the concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) model, was originally developed by  for planets with slow rotation rates. The CMS model is a selfconsistent field method that iteratively solves for the equilibrium shape of the surfaces of each of the constantdensity spheroids. However, the iterative equation used by  is based on an incomplete solution of the Poisson equation that diverges for high degrees of rotational flattening ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hubbard et al., 2014</ref>). An iterative approach for finding the shape of a single Maclaurin spheroid based on the full solution to the Poisson's equation was formulated by  but was not extended to consider planetary structures with multiple layers and variable densities. Although the issue of non-convergence is of little concern for slowly rotating planets such as Jupiter, for which the CMS model was designed, it is a significant issue for the rapidly rotating bodies that we consider in this work.</p><p>In order to be able to model rapidly rotating bodies, we built on the work of  to develop a new code. Here, we summarize the method, and full details are presented in §S1. The HERCULES (Highly Eccentric Rotating Concentric U (potential) Layers Equilibrium Structure) code models a body as a superposition of a number of overlapping, concentric, constant-density spheroids <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). The surface of each spheroid is defined by an equipotential surface. We refer to the region between two equipotential surfaces as a layer, and each layer is defined as being composed of a single material (e.g., silicate or iron). The density distribution in the planet is given by the superposition of the density of each of the spheroids. The total density of a layer in the body, ρ i , is given by the sum of the density of all the spheroids, δρ i , that have an equatorial radius larger than the inner edge of the layer. The code iteratively solves for the equilibrium structure and shape of the body while conserving the mass of each of the materials and the total AM. During each iteration, the density of the spheroids is altered so that the total density is consistent with a hydrostatic pressure profile, the EOS of the materials, and an imposed thermal state for each of the material layers. Each material's mass is conserved by altering the radius of each of the concentric layers. Although we refer to the volumes as spheroids, in our formulation the equipotential surfaces can be any rotationally symmetric surface whose radius decreases monotonically from equator to pole.</p><p>The HERCULES code cannot reach the same level of precision as the CMS model. The varying integration domains in the full solution to the Poisson's equation prevent the use of Gaussian quadrature, resulting in less precise numerical integration. However, the HERCULES code is capable of efficiently calculating a variety of planetary structures, including rapidly rotating planets, making it a versatile tool to use in a wide range of problems in planetary science.</p><p>As in the SPH calculations, we modeled Earth-like bodies with 2/3 silicate and 1/3 iron by mass, and used the same equations of state derived from the M-ANEOS model. A range of different thermal profiles were considered for the silicate ( §2.3). Unless noted otherwise, 100 constant-density layers were used: 20 for the iron core and 80 for the silicate. When the silicate was divided into two layers with different thermal states, 40 layers were used for each layer. The equipotential surfaces were defined using N µ = 1000 points, and terms up to spherical harmonic degree 12 were included in the iterative equation. The HER-CULES code requires a bounding pressure for the planet at the surface of the outermost layer. Unless otherwise stated, we assumed a bounding pressure of p min = 10 bar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Thermal profiles for isolated bodies</head><p>We considered isolated bodies with a range of thermal profiles. The variations in the thermal state of the core during accretion is not well understood. Here, we largely neglect these variations to focus on the thermal state of the silicate component. Each isolated body had an iron core of fixed specific entropy S core = 1.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 . This core isentrope has a temperature of ∼3800 K at the pressure of the present-day core mantle boundary (CMB), similar to the present thermal state of Earth's core (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anzellini et al., 2013</ref>). The effect of varying core entropy is discussed in §4.</p><p>For the silicate portion of bodies, we used three different classes of thermal profiles: (I) isentropic, (II) vapor atmosphere, and (III) stratified <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). For isentropic profiles (class I, green line in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), the silicate portion of the body has a constant specific entropy, S lower , which is the simplest possible thermal state with which to make comparisons. Except for the coldest bodies considered in this study, the outer layers of these structures intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary. In these cases, the low-pressure portions of the isentropic profile describe an ideal mixture of liquid and vapor, without any phase separation.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Schematic of how an axisymmetric planetary structure is modeled in the HERCULES code. A body is described as a superposition of a number of constant-density spheroids of density δρ i (shown in gray). The superposition of the spheroids gives a body with increasing density with depth. The volumes between successive spheroids are called layers. Each layer has a constant density, ρ i , given by the sum of the densities of all the spheroids larger than the spheroid that defines the inner edge of the layer. Each layer belongs to a material layer which determines the relationship between pressure and total density in that layer by use of the material's equation of state. Two material layers are shown separately in blues and oranges.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Examples of the different silicate thermal profiles considered for the calculation of the structure of isolated bodies. The silicate portion of each body was modeled as a simple system with two condensed phases and vapor using an equation of state for forsterite. The colored dashed lines correspond to the different classes of thermal profiles described in §2.3: (I) isentropic (green), (II) vapor atmosphere (red), and (III) stratified (blue). The solid black curve is the model liquid-vapor phase boundary for forsterite with the critical point (S crit = 5.40 kJ K −1 kg −1 , p crit = 25.5 kbar, T crit = 8810 K, ρ crit = 1680 kg m −3 ) shown by the black dot. Material in a thermal state plotting within the liquid-vapor phase boundary is a mixture of liquid and vapor with thermal states on each side of the boundary. Isentropes in pressure-temperature space are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S7</ref>.</p><p>Vapor atmosphere profiles (class II) are isentropic at high pressure with specific entropy, S lower , but if a profile intersects the liquid-vapor phase boundary, it follows the vapor side of the mixed phase region (red line in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In this case, regions with pressures below the intersection point are assumed to be pure vapor on the phase boundary. The outer layers of such structures represent a saturated silicate vapor atmosphere and have a greater specific entropy compared to an isentropic thermal profile defined by the same S lower (green line). The vapor atmosphere profile approximates the scenario where condensate efficiently rains out from the low-pressure regions of a body and the vapor is stratified. In a hot rocky body with a turbulent atmosphere, the rain out of condensates is unlikely to be wholly efficient, but the vapor atmosphere profile provides a useful end member case.</p><p>A stratified profile (class III) divides the silicate portion of a body into two separate material layers containing a specified mass fraction of the silicate. The lower layer is isentropic with specific entropy S lower . The upper layer has the same thermal structure as a vapor atmosphere profile: isentropic at higher pressures with specific entropy S upper and following the saturated vapor curve at lower pressures (blue dashed line in <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. The pressure at the boundary between the upper and lower layers varies between different bodies since the masses of the two silicate layers are dictated, not the pressure of transition. Here, we considered stratified profiles with an upper layer that contains 50 or 25% of the mass of the silicate. These stratified profiles are intended to emulate the thermal structures that are typically produced in hydrodynamic simulations of giant impacts. The impacting hemispheres of the colliding bodies are more highly shocked than the antipodal hemispheres. After gravitational equilibration, the post-impact body is thermally stratified with lower entropy material from the antipodal hemispheres at higher pressures and higher entropy material from the impacted hemispheres at lower pressures. Post-impact thermal profiles are much more variable than a simple two-layer structure, but the model stratified thermal profile allows us to examine the general effect of thermal stratification on planetary structure.</p><p>We have used specific entropy, rather than temperature, as the natural intensive variable to describe the thermal state for each layer within a planet. For liquid-vapor mixtures, the temperature is insufficient to determine the relative proportions of each phase at a given pressure. With specific entropy as the independent variable, the lever rule can be applied to determine the mass fraction of each phase using the material's liquid-vapor phase boundary, which is a dome in specific entropy-pressure space <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. In rocky planets, the thermal state of the mantle is often represented by the potential temperature, which is the temperature on the mantle isentrope at a reference pressure (usually 1 bar for terrestrial applications). The potential temperature is degenerate for thermal structures that intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S7</ref>), so it is not a useful parameter in this work. In addition, partially vaporized planets do not have a well-defined surface, and we must report the radius of the body at a specific pressure contour.</p><p>We expect that the accuracy of the EOS model for silicates will be improved as new data are acquired on forsterite and other silicate chemical compositions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Sekine et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Root et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Davies et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Davies et al., , 2017</ref>. In previous studies, the M-ANEOS model has been shown to underestimate the gain in entropy at high shock pressures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kraus et al., 2012</ref>). The model shock temperatures for forsterite overlap with the error bars reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bolis et al. (2016)</ref> up to about 500 GPa, which corresponds to a specific entropy slightly greater than the model critical point when shocked from standard pressure and temperature. As a result, the EOS model is inferred to underestimate the entropy gain at shock pressures &gt;∼500 GPa. Thus, the impact outcomes from the highest velocity events are likely to shift to a greater degree of vaporization with improving EOS models, but our general conclusions about changes in planetary structure relative to the degree of vaporization are robust.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Comparison of methods</head><p>The GADGET-2 and HERCULES codes implement fundamentally different approaches for modeling the equilibrium structure of isolated bodies. Nevertheless, the two techniques produce very similar structures for corotating bodies. Two examples of isentropic Earth-mass planets with a total angular momentum equal to the present-day Earth-Moon system (L EM = 3.5 × 10 34 kg m −2 s −1 ) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The SPH calculation is shown in red and the HERCULES calculation, using a bounding pressure of p min = 10 bar, is plotted in black. The well-known issues with resolving boundaries with high density contrasts in SPH can be seen at the core-mantle boundary, with a layer of anomalous density particles on either side of the boundary. However, the error at the boundary does not propagate to the rest of the structure. Similarly, cooler SPH planets that have a sharp boundary with vacuum have an outer layer of particles with an increased radial separation compared to interior particles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3A</ref>-C with S lower = 5 kJ K −1 kg −1 ), but this layer captures the correct density and pressure at that radius.</p><p>The limited resolution of the SPH simulations leads to an error in resolving the outer boundary of bodies, particularly for silicate specific entropies above the critical point. The SPH resolution is not sufficient to capture the mass of material in the low density, partially vaporized regions of hot bodies. For the example planet with an isentropic profile below the critical point entropy <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A-C)</ref>, the SPH calculation does not resolve pressures below about 2 × 10 4 bar. The scale height at the edge of a mostly condensed body is small, so the equatorial radius is only slightly smaller than that calculated with the HERCULES code with p min = 10 bar, about 6% in our example case. However, for substantially vaporized bodies with specific entropies above the critical point value (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3D</ref>-F with S lower = 6.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 ), the scale height of the low pressure regions is larger. Although the minimum pressure of the SPH planet is lower, at 1257 bar in our example case, the difference in equatorial radius is greater, about 15% smaller than that calculated with the HERCULES code with p min = 10 bar. To mimic the effect of the resolution limit in the SPH simulations, we also calculated a HER-CULES body using a bounding pressure of p min = 1257 bar (blue lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3D</ref>-F), the lowest pressure in the midplane of the SPH planet. In this case, the equatorial radius agreed with the SPH to within about 0.2%. The mass of the HERCULES body that lies outside of the surface of the SPH structure (outer red line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3D</ref>) and within the HERCULES 10-bar contour (black dashed line) is only about 10 −3 M Earth . The mass of this unresolved outer, partially vaporized layer is well below the resolution of the SPH simulation, where each particle has a mass of about 10 −5 M Earth . For all the isolated, corotating planets considered here, the differences between HERCULES and SPH calculations typically involved less than the mass of 500 SPH particles (&lt; 0.5 wt%), resulting in errors in the SPH equatorial radii less than about 15%. Since there is little mass in the region not resolved by the SPH planets, the corotating angular velocity of the bodies calculated using SPH and HERCULES are not substantially different <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 1)</ref>. SPH does not define the polar radius as well as the equatorial radius due to the difference in particle resolution along each axis of an oblate planet. This leads to a small error in the aspect ratio, the ratio of the polar to equatorial radii <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>In general, HERCULES is a more efficient and accurate method to model planetary structures compared to SPH. However, the current version of HERCULES can only calculate the structure of corotating bodies. A version of HERCULES that may solve for an imposed angular momentum structure is under development. As a result, we utilize SPH to study the structure of non-corotating bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The structure of hot, rotating rocky bodies</head><p>We calculated the structure of rocky bodies with varying thermal profiles and AM. To illustrate the range of solutions, we determined the equilibrium structures for one Earth-mass bodies for a range of AM and silicate isentropes (thermal profile class I) using GADGET-2. We find that there are a wide variety of possible structures, ranging from compact to highly extended, as shown by the pressure contours in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>. Pressures were interpolated between SPH particles using a Delaunay triangulation. To avoid spurious contour lines in the extended regions with low particle density, the outermost few particles in each radial bin were not included when calculating the contours. The width of the radial bins and the number of particles excluded were varied depending on the structure being plotted. The gaps in some structures in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref>    [log 10 (bar)]    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Each body has a constant specific entropy silicate layer of S lower (thermal profile class I). are due to the lack of resolution in those areas. In hot, high-AM structures the plotted pressure contours do not close as the scale height at the upper and lower surfaces of the structure is not resolved. Increasing the specific entropy of the silicate leads to an increase in the fraction of vapor in the low-pressure regions of the body and a substantial increase in radius. At low AM, the structures are nearly spherical, oblate spheroids rotating with a single angular velocity, regardless of thermal state. However, bodies with higher AM do not always maintain a simple oblate spheroidal shape. The equilibrium structure for an isolated body of a fixed mass and composition can attain a large range of morphologies and sizes, depending on thermal state and total AM. To illustrate the dynamics of extended planetary structures, we compare the rotational profiles of bodies with different silicate specific entropies at a total AM of 2.45L EM . In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, the pressure field and size of the structure are represented by the colored contours in the top row. Pressures were interpolated in the same manner as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>. The radial angular velocity and specific angular momentum in the equatorial plane are shown by the black dots in the middle and bottoms rows, respectively. High-AM bodies with low specific entropies have a constant angular velocity (i.e., are in solid body rotation) and consequently adopt very oblate equilibrium structures to conserve AM ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>-C). At higher specific entropies, the fraction of vapor in the outer regions is greater and the structure thermally expands. To maintain a fixed total AM, increasing the specific entropy is balanced by lower angular velocities. At a specific combination of AM and specific entropy, the angular velocity at the equator of the body intersects the Keplerian angular velocity. In <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, the bodies in the left (A-C) and middle (D-F) columns are before and after this intersection. Beyond the intersection, it is not possible to attain an equilibrium corotating structure. The centripetal force required to remain bound and corotating is greater than the gravitational force, and a negative pressure gradient would be required to keep the equator at the same angular velocity as the interior of the body. A negative pressure gradient is non-physical and instead the outer edge of the body must adopt a Keplerian or sub-Keplerian angular velocity. With increasing specific entropy, the pressure gradient support of the structure increases, and the sub-Keplerian region of the structure expands substantially ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5G-I)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SPH</head><p>We define the limit for planetary bodies with constant angular velocity as the corotation limit (CoRoL). The CoRoL is a surface that depends upon the mass, compositional layering, thermal profile, and AM of a body. Above the CoRoL, there is no solution for the planetary structure that is both hydrostatic and corotating. For bodies below the CoRoL, there is a unique solution for a perfectly corotating structure. However, above the CoRoL, there is no unique solution to the structure as it depends on the spatial distribution of mass and AM. The range of possible super-CoRoL structures depends on the mechanism that drove the body beyond the limit.</p><p>For the isolated SPH bodies shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>, the silicate particles were incrementally heated in an attempt to obtain as small a structure as possible (see §2.1). Incremental heating limited the mass and AM transported into the sub-Keplerian region of the structure during gravitational re-equilibration. Other processes that drive a planet beyond the CoRoL, such as giant impacts, can introduce more mass and AM farther out in the structure.</p><p>We name structures beyond the CoRoL synestias, after the Greek syn for connected and Hestia for the goddess of architecture. The traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere, and disk are not applicable in synestias ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5D</ref>-I). In this work, we refer to the corotating portion of both super-CoRoL and sub-CoRoL structures as the corotating region, and the Keplerian or sub-Keplerian portion of structures as the disk-like region or connected disk. The region between the corotating and disk-like regions we refer to as the transition region. In typical synestias, there is a monotonic angular velocity profile connecting the corotating and disk-like regions ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5E</ref>,H) and the transition region is very narrow. Synestias can be attained by a variety of celestial bodies and are not restricted to rocky bodies ( §6.8).</p><p>The shapes of synestias can vary from bodies with pinched equators to bodies with flared disk-like regions. Flaring typically only occurs at low pressures in the structure but can be substantial. The most extended structures in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> have a vertical scale height in the lowpressure regions on the same order as the polar radius of the corotating region. The equatorial radius of synestias can extend beyond the Roche limit, which is the closest distance a satellite can withstand tidal forces from the planet (∼18 × 10 6 m for silicate satellites orbiting an Earth-mass body).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The corotation limit (CoRoL) for rocky planets</head><p>We have determined the CoRoL as a function of mass, AM, and thermal state for Earth-like planets using the HERCULES code. As the current version of HERCULES cannot calculate the structure of non-corotating bodies, including synestias, we find the CoRoL by extrapolation from corotating bodies. In AM increments of 0.05 or 0.01 L EM , we calculated the equilibrium structure of corotating bodies with a given thermal profile, compositional layering, and mass. Above a certain AM, close to the CoRoL, HERCULES is no longer able to find a physical solution to the structure as, during at least one iteration, the total potential gradient at the edge of the body changes sign. This causes the equipotential surfaces to cross at higher latitudes, breaking the assumptions of the model. In order to find the CoRoL, we linearly extrapolate to higher AM to find the point at which the corotating and Keplerian angular velocities at the edge of the structure intersect ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure S8</ref>). This point is the CoRoL and is generally close to the highest AM structure found by HERCULES.</p><p>The equatorial radius, and hence the CoRoL, is very sensitive to the specific entropy of the outer regions of the body and the total AM. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref> presents the calculated equatorial radius for Earth-mass bodies with isentropic silicate layers (thermal profile class I), where each line indicates the radius for a constant specific entropy and varying total AM. Each line terminates at the limit of corotating equilibrium structures, and the locus of such points defines the CoRoL (black line) for this specific planetary mass, compositional layering, and thermal profile. Hotter bodies have significantly expanded equatorial radii and cross the CoRoL at lower AM. Even below the CoRoL, the equatorial radius varies by a factor of three depending on thermal state and AM.</p><p>The CoRoL is also sensitive to the thermal profile within the body ( §2.3). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> presents the CoRoL in terms of (A) the specific entropy of the silicate layer (upper layer for stratified profiles (class III)) and (B) the 10-bar equatorial radius, as a function of AM. The AM required to exceed the CoRoL with an isentropic profile (class I) is offset from the other thermal profiles because the density profile assumes an ideal mixture of liquid and vapor in the mixed phase region. Vapor atmosphere profiles (class II), with pure gas densities in the lowest pressure layers, produce bodies with larger equatorial radii and reach the CoRoL at lower AM for the same value for S lower . For low specific entropies, the CoRoL for bodies with isentropic (class I) and vapor atmosphere (class II) thermal profiles tend towards each other because the mixed phase region of the structure is absent or negligible. At high specific entropies, the CoRoL for bodies with isentropic (class I) and vapor atmosphere (class II) thermal profiles converge as the mixed phase regions of isentropic bodies become increasingly dominated by vapor. At these high specific entropies, the CoRoL turns over as the slower rotation rate of the more extended structures begins to overcome the effect of an increased equatorial radius. We also considered bodies with stratified thermal profiles (class III) with a colder lower silicate layer (S lower ) and hotter upper silicate layer (S upper ). For S upper &gt;∼ 5.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 , such structures cross the CoRoL at a lower AM compared to bodies with the vapor atmosphere profile (class II) with a silicate specific entropy equal to S upper . The cold lower silicate layer is more compact and closer to the rotation axis than the equivalent mass fraction of bodies with vapor atmosphere profiles or isentropic profiles with high specific entropies. Accordingly, the structure has a lower moment of inertia, and the cold lower silicate layer of a stratified body does not accommodate as much AM for a given angular velocity. Thus, stratified bodies must rotate faster, compared to an isentropic body with the same AM, and the equator of the planet intersects the Keplerian orbit at a lower total AM. This effect increases with a larger difference in specific entropy between the upper and lower silicate layers. The CoRoL does not turn over for thermally stratified structures in the range of specific entropies considered because the cold dense cores of such bodies have a comparatively low moment of inertia. Because the isentropic case requires a higher specific entropy to reach the CoRoL compared to stratified structures, the suite of isentropic structures in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> has fewer synestias over this range of AM and specific entropy than would be achieved by stratified bodies. The fact that thermal stratification causes bodies to cross the CoRoL at lower AM is significant because giant impacts create stratified structures ( §5).</p><p>The different thermal profiles have substantially different equatorial radii at the CoRoL ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7B</ref>) because of the strong sensitivity of the radius to the thermal state of the outermost layers. However, in terms of specific entropy, the CoRoL is similar for the different stratified thermal profiles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7A</ref>). Consequently, the total angular momentum and specific entropy of the outer silicate layers are reliable metrics to determine if a particular stratified body is above the CoRoL.</p><p>For the expected range of values for Earth, the specific entropy of the iron core has little effect on the CoRoL for Earth-like bodies. For the iron EOS model used here, the present thermal state of Earth's core corresponds to a specific entropy of ∼1.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 . The thermal history of the core is debated, so we considered a range of specific entropies, S core = 1 to 2 kJ K −1 kg −1 , corresponding to temperatures of 700 to 11,000 K at the pressure of the presentday core-mantle boundary. This temperature range covers estimates for the early Earth's core that were calculated by requiring a core dynamo of its present strength for all of Earth history (e.g., . A higher specific entropy core slightly increases the AM required to exceed the CoRoL because the increased moment of inertia of the extended core reduces the corotating angular velocity at a given AM. We find that, for the range of core entropies considered, the equatorial radius of the structure and the AM required to exceed the CoRoL vary by only a few percent due to the low thermal expansivity of iron at high pressures.</p><p>The CoRoL is also dependent on the mass of the body ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>). We modeled the relationship between mass and the AM required to exceed the CoRoL for Earth-like bodies by a simple power law of the form L CoRoL ∝ M γ , where M is the mass of the body. The value of the exponent, γ, only varies slightly between different thermal structures. We fit the exponent for the three example thermal profiles shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>. For the 5.5 and 6.0 kJ K −1 kg −1 isentropic profiles (class I, solid lines), γ = 1.69 and 1.73, respectively. For the example stratified planet (class III) with 50 wt% at 6.0 kJ K −1 kg −1 (dot-dashed line), γ = 1.77. These fits are good for larger mass planets but miscalculate the AM to exceed the CoRoL by 10 to 25% for 0.5 M Earth bodies and produce a misfit on the order of a few percent for M Earth bodies. The angular velocity of a body at the CoRoL also increases with mass and varies significantly for different thermal structures. The increase in angular velocity scales linearly with the logarithm of the mass of the body for the whole range of mass we considered. <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table S5</ref> presents a summary of the CoRoL for different rocky bodies calculated with the HERCULES code.  Using the HERCULES code, we calculated the CoRoL for bodies with isentropic (black line, class I), vapor atmosphere (red line, class II), and stratified silicate (class III) thermal profiles. We present the CoRoL in terms of (A) the silicate specific entropy used to define the thermal profile and (B) the equatorial radius as a function of angular momentum. For stratified profiles only the specific entropy of the upper silicate layer was varied, and the lower layer was held constant with S lower = 4 kJ K −1 kg −1 . Stratified profiles ( §2.3) with 25% (orange line) and 50% (blue line) by mass upper silicate layers are shown. Symbols are for bodies with isentropic (class I, +) and stratified (class III, ) silicate thermal profiles. Stratified profiles with 50% by mass cold lower silicate layer S lower = 3 kJ K −1 kg −1 were used. The lines are power law (A) or log-linear (B) fits to the calculated points. Colors indicate the specific entropy of the silicates or upper silicate layer for the isentropic and stratified profiles, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The structure of post-impact states</head><p>Rocky bodies are naturally forced into hot, rotating states by giant impacts during the later stages of accretion. We seek to understand the significance of hot, rotating planetary structures by assessing the range of possible structures that could be attained during planet formation and the frequency of occurrence. First we examine and attempt to classify the dynamical and thermal structures of post-giant impact states. In order to do this, we calculated the outcome of impacts between Earth-like bodies with a range of collision parameters using SPH, as described in §2.1, and combined our results with the simulations from´Cuk from´ from´Cuk and Stewart (2012). We examined the instantaneous structures of post-impact structures at 24 to 48 hrs after first contact, when the structure had reached a quasisteady mass and AM distribution. This suite of impacts covers a range of impact energies but focuses on those that have high enough specific impact energy to be described as giant impacts by <ref type="bibr">Quintana et al. (2016) ( §5.2)</ref>. The full set of impacts are summarized in <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>.</p><p>We find that there is a broad range of post-impact structures, in terms of both thermal and dynamical state. Three example post-impact structures with substantial disk-like regions are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. All structures have a corotating region close to the rotational axis, and a Keplerian or sub-Keplerian disk-like region farther out. The transition region varies substantially between different structures. A large fraction of our suite of post-impact states have very narrow transition regions and the corotating region grades smoothly into the disk-like region, as is the case for isolated synestias ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). But, in some cases there is a shear boundary (an increasing angular velocity with radius) in the transition region which varies in magnitude and width ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9A</ref> and I). The prevalence of structures with narrow transition regions is likely biased by the many high-AM impacts with fast, small impactors in our suite of impacts. The nature of the transition region is determined both by the AM and thermal state of the structure, as we discuss below.</p><p>Impact-induced heating is very heterogeneous and postimpact structures are far from isentropic. The inner regions of the structure are thermally stratified with a monotonically increasing specific entropy with radius ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>,G,K). This general profile is produced by buoyancy and rotational forces during the impact acting to impose a monotonically decreasing density profile. Such gravitationally-equilibrated profiles neglect any effects from chemistry, thermal equilibration, or shear strength that may act on the dynamical timescale of hours. For impacts between initially condensed bodies, the post-impact lowermost mantle is a high-pressure liquid or a liquid-solid mixture (see discussions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2015)</ref> with specific entropies typically between 3 and 5 kJ K −1 kg −1 . The  specific entropy of the silicates in the inner regions increases substantially with radius ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>,G,K), typically far exceeding the specific entropy of the critical point (S crit = 5.40 kJ K −1 kg −1 ). In most cases we considered, the corotating region does not intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary. At high pressure in the body, the silicate grades smoothly from a liquid into a supercritical fluid and then vapor. In the cases where the thermal profile does intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary for a range of pressures within the corotating region, the condensate fraction is usually small. The thermal state of the silicates farther out in the structure is more variable. Some structures have disk-like regions that have high specific entropy and are mostly vaporized even to beyond the Roche limit ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9G</ref>), while others have disk-like regions that are much colder and have a large mass fraction that is condensed ( <ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>,K). In the latter case, the transition between the high-entropy inner regions and the colder disk-like regions typically occurs in the dynamical transition region. The parcels of material represented by SPH particles cannot thermally equilibrate with each other. As a result, colder, more condensed particles can coexist with hotter, mostly vapor particles in the transition region. The colder particles are less pressure supported than the vaporized particles and rotate at a lower angular velocity at the same radius. These colder particles complicate the dynamics in the transition region for the SPH post-impact structures (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). In reality, the material represented by the colder and hotter SPH particles would thermally equilibrate, and in most cases in our suite of post-impact states, the transition region would evolve to be dominantly vapor. In all cases, there may be some (comparatively colder) material in orbit at larger distances (e.g., a distal debris disk) that is not continuous with the central structure.</p><p>We examined whether post-impact structures are below or above the CoRoL. Sub-CoRoL structures (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Fig</ref>ure 9A-D) do not have sufficient AM for the hot, inner regions of the structure to extend out to the intersection between the corotating and Keplerian angular velocities (black dashed line in <ref type="figure">Figure 9)</ref>. Consequently, the vapor at the edge of the hot inner regions is sheared as the angular velocity profile transitions from corotating to subKeplerian. The disk-like regions of sub-CoRoL structures tend to have a low vapor fraction in the midplane. In SPH post-impact, sub-CoRoL structures there are colder particles in the transition region that contribute to the shear, but the angular velocity profile is still dominated by the shear in the vapor. Conversely, in super-CoRoL structures (synestias), the hot inner regions extend out to the intersection between the corotating and Keplerian angular velocities. There is a smooth transition in the angular velocity of the vapor from the corotating inner region to the sub-Keplerian disk-like region. In some super-CoRoL structures, there are colder particles in the transition region that have different angular velocities than the vapor, leading to an apparent shear. However, this shear does not significantly affect the overall smooth angular velocity profile. In a few cases, it is difficult to determine whether the structure is above or below the CoRoL. An example of such a structure is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9I</ref>-L. The vapor of the inner region only just extends to the intersection between the corotating and Keplerian angular velocities, and there is a substantial mass of colder particles in the transition region. As a result, the mass averaged angular velocity profile has a small shear boundary. It is not clear from the SPH post-impact structure alone whether such structures are above the CoRoL nor whether they would remain so following thermal equilibration. We classify such structures as co-CoRoL as they are at the border between sub-CoRoL and super-CoRoL states.</p><p>We would like to compare the shape of post-impact structures to those of the isolated synestias; however, the inability of impact codes to correctly model phase separation makes it difficult to calculate the pressure field that would be expected immediately after an impact. To approximate the vapor pressure field in each of our example cases, we have modified the post-impact states produced by SPH to remove the condensed material. We removed unbound SPH particles and the condensed mass fraction of bound SPH particles in the disk-like region from the simulation at 24 hrs after the impact. The structure was then re-equilibrated for a further 24 hrs with the mass of any condensate removed at each time step. The resulting structure approximates the continuous vapor pressure field at several dynamical times after the impact if the condensate was fully decoupled from the vapor and the effects of cooling were neglected. The calculated pressure fields, and corresponding specific entropy fields, for the three examples cases are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref>. The pressure fields and angular velocity profiles for the super-CoRoL and co-CoRoL cases are similar to those found for isolated synestias <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 4 and 5)</ref>. Impacts emplace significant amounts of mass and AM far from the rotation axis and the vapor structure can extend beyond the Roche limit, with significant vapor pressure (10's of bar) at several Earth radii. The larger masses in the disk-like regions and the increase of specific entropy with decreasing pressure in the post-impact states ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10B</ref>,E,H) leads to more exaggerated flaring than in the isentropic isolated bodies in Figures 4 and 5. The concentration of cold material in the midplane is due to buoyancy driven settling and is partly a result of the lack of thermal equilibration in the SPH code. For the particular example of a co-CoRoL case in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the structure after condensate extraction is above the CoRoL and the resulting angular velocity profile structure becomes monotonically decreasing with radius. The sub-CoRoL example also shows a flared pressure field similar to the other cases but with lower pressures. The angular velocity profile in the sub-CoRoL case still has a shear boundary after removing the condensate, and the profile is similar to the expected solution for a shearing fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chandrasekhar, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Desch and Taylor, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, we compare the post-impact structures to   <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p><p>the CoRoL for stratified thermal profiles. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>, the CoRoL is defined by similar AM and outer specific entropy for a variety of stratified thermal profiles. The majority of our post-impact states that we identified as super-CoRoL or co-CoRoL exceed the CoRoL calculated for stratified bodies when considering the specific entropy of the outer 50 or 25 wt% of the body. All our sub-CoRoL structures fall below the CoRoL for stratified bodies. There are some structures that we identified as super-CoRoL structures that fall below the CoRoL plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. These structures typically have thermal profiles where the top few percent of the mass has very high specific entropies. As a consequence, the structures intersect the CoRoL but with very little mass in the disk-like region (filled circles in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). The existence of very hot outer regions is not captured in the average entropy of the structure and comparing such structures with the CoRoL for stratified planets with 50 or 25 wt% hot outer layers is not a good indicator of whether the structure is above the CoRoL. Next, we consider the structure of post-impact bodies in the context of proposed Moon-formation scenarios. The example cases shown in Figures 9 are examples of proposed Moon-forming giant impacts. A-D show a typical structure formed by an impact in the style of the canonical Moonforming impact (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Canup, , 2008a</ref>): sub-CoRoL structures with relatively cold disk-like regions. E-H and I-L show example high-AM, high-energy Moon-forming impacts from´Cukfrom´ from´Cuk and Stewart (2012) and Canup (2012), respectively. These high-AM impacts tend to produce super-CoRoL or co-CoRoL structures with substantially vaporized disk-like regions. Note that both the high-AM studies proposed a range of impact energies and impact parameters as potential Moonforming events. Previous studies of post-impact states after the canonical impact (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Canup, , 2008a</ref>) did not observe synestias as they only considered bodies with an AM similar to the present-day Earth-Moon system. Such bodies would require very high specific entropies in their outer layers to exceed the CoRoL <ref type="figure">(Figure 11</ref>). Such hot thermal states are not reached in canonical style impacts.</p><p>A significant implication of this analysis is that some post-impact structures cannot be analyzed as a separate planet and disk, as is common in studies of post-impact states. Instead, the post-impact structures are synestias, which must be treated as a single extended structure. The impact-generated synestias have a large variation in the mass of the disk-like region. The proportion of mass and AM in the disk-like region is determined by the impact conditions (with consistent results between different types of codes, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Canup et al., 2013)</ref>. Because these structures exceed the CoRoL, any process that transfers mass from the disk-like region to the corotating region (and preserves the mean specific entropy and AM), would not be able to transfer all the mass to the corotating region. Or, more colloquially, the entire disk-like region cannot fall down. Because the structure is expected to cool by radiation (perhaps mitigated by internal dynamics such as viscous heating and continuing accretion), an impactgenerated synestia will evolve to a state below the CoRoL, but the timescale will depend on the evolutionary path for that particular body. This investigation of post-impact states is a snapshot of the (near) initial structure after the event.</p><p>5.2. The likelihood of hot, rapidly rotating post-impact states Next, we examine the likelihood of generating hot, rapidly rotating post-impact states during the giant impact stage of terrestrial planet formation. First, we examine the specific entropy of post-impact structures. We find that the specific entropy of the outer silicate portions of post-impact structures scales well with a modified specific impact energy, Q S . Q S is a variation of the parameter developed in  that adjusts for the geometry of collisions between similarly sized bodies to estimate the relative deposition of impact energy into the post-impact body for different collision scenarios (supporting information §S4).</p><p>We find that the specific entropy of the outer silicate layers scales linearly with the logarithm of specific impact energy for post-impact bodies with masses between 0.9 and 1.1 M Earth and Q S &gt;∼10 6 J kg −1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 12)</ref>. Q S does not account for any entropy increase caused by secondary impacts in graze and merge collisions or by reimpacting debris. Such effects can be significant, particularly for low energy impacts, and are likely responsible for the apparent plateau in entropies at low Q S in our suite of impacts as these low energies are dominated by graze and merge, canonical-style Moon-forming impacts. Impacts with Q S &gt; 2×10 6 J kg −1 generally deposit sufficient energy such that the upper 25 wt% of the silicates have an average specific entropy that exceeds the critical point value for the equation of state, S crit = 5.4 kJ K −1 kg −1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 12B</ref>, solid line). For impacts with Q S &gt; 5 × 10 6 J kg −1 , the upper 50 wt% of silicates typically attain mean specific entropies above the critical point ( <ref type="figure">Figure 12A</ref>, dashed line). Such hot post-impact structures are dominantly vapor at low pressures. They have much larger radii compared to entirely condensed planets of the same mass and AM. The correlation between post-impact thermal state and specific impact energy provides a straightforward means to determine which collisions during accretion lead to highly vaporized structures.</p><p>N -body simulations of terrestrial planet formation have recently incorporated more realistic collision outcome models including fragmentation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chambers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Carter et al., 2015;</ref>.  used the same modified specific impact energy, Q S , to evaluate the collisions in their simulations and graciously provided us with the collision histories for the final planets. We calculated the number of high energy impacts that near Earth-mass planets experience as they   accrete. We find that most near Earth-mass planets experienced several giant impacts with Q S &gt; 2 × 10 6 J kg −1 during accretion and over half also experienced at least one impact with Q S &gt; 5 × 10 6 J kg −1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13)</ref>. Assuming that the scaling of thermal state with impact energy holds for smaller bodies <ref type="figure">(Figure 12</ref>), we expect rocky bodies to form highly vaporized structures multiple times during accretion. Other N -body studies without fragmentation and with different initial conditions and alternative configurations of the giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">O'Brien et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hansen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Raymond et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Walsh et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Levison et al., 2015</ref>) all produce high-energy impacts in the final stages of accretion although the frequency of different energy impacts may change between these different scenarios.</p><p>The rotational states of terrestrial bodies during accretion is difficult to track, especially because partitioning of AM between the growing bodies, collision ejecta, and a planetesimal population is poorly understood. N -body studies have found that each giant impact can dramatically alter the spin state of a growing planet (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agnor et al., 1999</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda (2010)</ref> have conducted the best assessment to date of the spin state of rocky planets during accretion. They used an N -body simulation of planet formation with bimodal impact outcomes, either perfect merging or hit-and-run, and tracked the AM of each of the bodies in the simulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda (2010)</ref> found that the mean AM of rocky planets is large, e.g., 2.69 L EM for Earth-mass planets, and that the distribution of AM is wide. The mean angular velocity of final planets was similar for the entire mass range in their study, covering planetary masses between about 0.25 and 1.75 M Earth . We infer that that the AM of terrestrial bodies roughly scales as L = 2.69L EM (M/M Earth ) 5/3 (black line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8A</ref>). These results indicate that the AM of planets during accretion is expected to be large and that the present-day AM of planets have been modified by satellite and solar tides.</p><p>The prevalence of both hot and high-AM states for terrestrial bodies during accretion makes the formation of synestias highly likely. In <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, we find that thermal states with dominantly vapor outer layers (e.g., S upper &gt; S crit ) reach the CoRoL for AM greater than about 1.5L EM . <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda (2010)</ref> found that a majority of Earth-mass planets exceed this AM at the end of accretion. Our examination of impact energies during accretion find that nearly all Earth-mass planets experience one or more collisions that produce dominantly vapor outer layers. Therefore, we conclude that it is common for Earthmass bodies to exceed the CoRoL and form synestias one or more times during accretion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Dynamic stability of hot, rotating planetary structures</head><p>Rapidly rotating, axisymmetric bodies can be susceptible to dynamic instabilities, such as the bar instability that causes the breakdown of axial symmetry and drives reorganization of the structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chandrasekhar, 1969)</ref>. Constant-density, rotating spheroids are also known to transition from axisymmetric Maclaurin spheroids to nonaxisymmetric Jacobi spheroids above a critical degree of rotational flattening, because Jacobi spheroids are lower energy states <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chandrasekhar, 1969)</ref>. If rapidly rotating axisymmetric planetary structures were susceptible to such instabilities, the structure could rearrange or break up. Here, we examine the stability of the rapidly rotating planetary structures considered in this work.</p><p>The stability of rapidly rotating fluid bodies is typically evaluated by the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy, T , to the gravitational potential energy, W . Rotating bodies are unstable to non-axisymmetric modes if the ratio T /|W | is above a critical value, which varies depending on the body in question. Constant-density Maclaurin spheroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chandrasekhar, 1969)</ref>, stellar systems (Ostriker and Peebles, 1973), rapidly rotating white dwarfs <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ostriker and Tassoul, 1969)</ref>, and polytropic stars <ref type="bibr">(Ostriker and Boden- heimer, 1973)</ref> have critical values in the range 0.14 to 0.27. All the pre-and super-CoRoL structures considered in this work have an energy ratio T /|W | below this range of critical values. For example, the highest value for the structures shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> is 0.07. For the postimpact structures we studied for this paper <ref type="table">(Table S4)</ref> the maximum value is 0.085 and the average value is 0.042. We also did not observe any instabilities or triaxial structures in our isolated body SPH calculations, where the equilibrium shapes were calculated over many dynamical timescales. Therefore, based on the energy stability criteria and our empirical observations, the rapidly rotating planetary structures presented in this work are likely to be dynamically stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Lifetimes of hot planetary structures</head><p>Although hot, extended planetary structures are dynamically stable, they evolve by radiating energy. In some cases, AM may be reduced by tides or resonant interactions. For synestias, a sufficient decrease in AM or thermal energy will cause the body to fall below the CoRoL and adopt a more compact, corotating structure. Bodies that are far enough away from their host stars will eventually cool to a silicate magma ocean overlain by a volatile dominated atmosphere. Calculating the timescales for the collapse of synestias and the cooling of post-impact states to magma oceans is key to understanding the influence of post-impact states on the evolution of terrestrial planets.</p><p>Synestias formed by impacts are substantially vapor in their disk-like regions. Unless the body is very close to its parent star, the outer regions of the structure are expected to cool quickly by radiation. When the photosphere is controlled by silicate condensation, the radiative temperature is high (∼2300 K, , but the energy that needs to be radiated to fall below the CoRoL is substantial. Condensing the vapor requires significant energy loss, both to cool to the phase boundary and to release the latent heat of vaporization of silicates. The contraction of the structure upon cooling also releases a comparable amount of potential energy. The amount of energy that needs to be radiated to fall below the CoRoL depends on how the internal energy is redistributed during cooling because the thermal structure affects the location of the CoRoL. We can estimate a lower limit on the timescale to cool below the CoRoL by considering just the potential energy difference between a post-impact structure and a corotating body of the same AM, with a thermal state slightly below the CoRoL. This approach neglects the loss of energy required to reduce the specific entropy of the outer layer of silicates (for a fixed AM) to below the CoRoL, which could be substantial. We assume a radiative temperature of ∼2300 K for silicate vapor. However, the surface area of the structure will change with time, and the difference in radiative surface area between the post-impact state and the sub-CoRoL structure is an order of magnitude. As a result, there is a substantial uncertainty in cooling time. Considering the full range of possible radiative surfaces, typical Earth-mass post-impact synestias would require a minimum time of order 10 1 to 10 3 yrs to cool to a state below the CoRoL.</p><p>Alternatively, a synestia could be brought below the CoRoL by removing AM from the structure by tides, interactions with the host star ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Murray and Dermott, 1999</ref>), or three body interactions with the host star and a moon <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goldreich, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Touma and Wisdom, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Wisdom and Tian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Tian et al., 2017)</ref>. A significant reduction of AM by tides takes 10 3 -10 9 yrs, depending on the mechanism, which is generally greater than the radiative cooling timescale. AM may also be redistributed by viscous spreading, but the whole structure would remain above the CoRoL (for a fixed thermal state). Thus, an impact-generated Earthmass synestia would be stable for greater than 10's to 1000's of years.</p><p>The timescale for a post-impact structure to cool to a fully condensed magma ocean is longer. To estimate the timescale, we calculate the difference in potential, kinetic and internal energy between post-impact states and corotating, isentropic condensed planets of the same AM (left column in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4)</ref>. We again assume a radiative temperature of ∼2300 K and consider radiative surface areas ranging from the post-impact state to a fully condensed body. For highly extended post-impact states that are above the CoRoL, the cooling time to a magma ocean state is on the order of 10 2 to 10 3 yrs. For post-impact states produced by less energetic impacts that do not begin above the CoRoL, the timescale is shorter, but still on the order of 10 2 to 10 3 yrs.</p><p>For all partially vaporized states, the cooling time may be substantially extended if the chemistry of the system produces a lower-temperature photosphere. For example, refractory components in the photosphere may form relatively low-temperature hazes. The chemistry of the silicate atmosphere will also evolve as it cools, potentially changing the effective radiative temperature. In addition, the energy input from continued accretion will increase the cooling timescale of post-giant impact structures, especially if the accreting bodies were small and primarily deposited their energy in the high-entropy outer layers of the body. The lifetime of hot, extended structures affects the accretion and evolution of terrestrial planets ( §6.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">CoRoL vs. solid body rotational breakup</head><p>The rotational breakup of small rocky bodies has been extensively studied due to its importance in bounding the possible rotational states of minor planets and in understanding the origin of multiple asteroid systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Har- ris, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Pravec and Harris, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Richardson and Walsh, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Holsapple, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Richardson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">´ Cuk, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Walsh et al., 2008)</ref> (see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Walsh and Jacobson, 2015)</ref>. Solid bodies with a range of material strength properties have been considered. Cohesionless asteroids share similarities with fluid bodies, and the spin stability limit for self-gravitating solid bodies with deformation has been studied in detail (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Holsapple, 2004</ref>).</p><p>The CoRoL for the larger rocky bodies studied in this work is different than the critical spin limit for small bodies. The typical assumption of incompressibility used in the small body literature does not hold for planet-sized bodies. In addition, planetary bodies with hot thermal states intersect the liquid-vapor phase boundary, leading to a significant decrease in average density. Accordingly, the CoRoL is typically reached at a lower AM compared to the critical spin limit for a rigid, condensed body.</p><p>The outcome of exceeding spin stability is also different for asteroids and hot planets. Upon exceeding the critical spin limit, an asteroid will shear into two or more bodies with relative motions that conserve AM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">( ´ Cuk, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Walsh et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Walsh and Jacobson, 2015)</ref>. In contrast, a hot planetary body that exceeds the CoRoL can remain a single structure with the excess AM forming a disk-like region. Therefore, the CoRoL is a new dynamical transition that is fundamentally different from the well-studied critical spin limit for smaller solid bodies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Analysis of post-impact structures</head><p>The structure and evolution of post-impact states can have a substantial impact on planet formation and the final properties of terrestrial planets ( §6.5). In particular, the properties of the disk-like regions of post-impact structures control the mechanisms and efficiency of satellite formation ( §6.6). The numerical methods used to model giant impacts cannot be used to directly model satellite formation. Hence, dedicated disk structure and evolution models have been used to study the formation of moons from the disk-like regions of post-impact structures, with initial conditions based on the results of impact simulations. Informed by work on astrophysical disks, most studies treat post-impact structures as consisting of a distinct planet and disk, both for modeling the disk evolution and for analyzing post-impact states. However, as discussed in §5 and shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, above the CoRoL the entire post-impact structure can be continuous between the corotating and disk-like regions. Even below the CoRoL, there may be significant vapor pressure in the transition region between the corotating and disk-like regions (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10A</ref>), and the disk-like region cannot be treated in isolation from the rest of the structure. Here, we summarize previous work on the structure of circumterrestrial disks formed by giant impacts and identify some issues with common approaches taken in these studies.</p><p>Published studies of giant impacts have made different assumptions on how to divide post-impact structures into a planet and a disk. Since most impact studies have utilized SPH, in this section we refer to a parcel of material as a particle. The majority of studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Canup, , 2008a</ref><ref type="bibr">Stevenson, 2014, 2015)</ref> have used an iterative routine to divide the structure, e.g., as described in . First, an initial guess is made to estimate the mass and equatorial radius of the planet. Particles are defined as being part of the planet or disk based on their AM. A particle is classified as being in the disk if it has sufficient AM such that the semi-major axis of a circular Keplerian orbit with the same AM is greater than the planet's equatorial radius. Bound particles that are not classified as being in the disk are considered to be part of the planet. The equatorial radius of the planet is recalculated based on the total mass and AM of all the particles classified as being in the planet, assuming the planet has a similar bulk density to the present-day Earth and limited rotational flattening. The particles are then reclassified based on the new mass and radius of the planet and the procedure is repeated until convergence. Alternatively, ´ Cuk and Stewart (2012) used a density contour of 1000 kg m −3 to define the planet's equatorial radius due to the large rotational flattening of the planet. As in the iterative routine, material with sufficient AM to be in a circular Keplerian orbit above the equator of the planet was considered to be part of the disk. Low density material that did not meet the AM requirement to be in the disk was considered to be part of a vapor atmosphere around the planet. The combined mass of the planet and the atmosphere was used for calculating the orbit of particles. In both methods, once the structure is divided into a planet and disk, the surface density of the disk is calculated by moving the mass of each disk particle to the semi-major axis of the equivalent circular Keplerian orbit for the AM of that particle. Although the details differ slightly, previous work applied the same principle of dividing the structure based on AM, and we refer to both methods as the conventional analysis.</p><p>The conventional analysis neglects the connection between the disk-like region and the corotating region of the structure through the vapor phase. Also, the radius of the planet defined in the conventional analysis does not account for the large mass of high specific entropy, lowdensity material in the corotating and transition regions of the structure because the planet is assumed to have a bulk density corresponding to condensed material (of order 10 3 kg m −3 ). The assumptions made in analyzing post-impact states are important as the properties of the post-impact structure (e.g., the disk mass, AM and surface density) calculated using the conventional analysis and reported in impact studies are used to inform the initial conditions of disk evolution models, either directly or indirectly.</p><p>Most studies of disks in the aftermath of giant impacts have focused on the Moon-forming event (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thomp- son and Stevenson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ida et al., 1997</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kokubo et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ward, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Ward, , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Ward, , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Canup, 2012, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Canup et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015</ref>). In the canonical giant impact, ∼20 wt% of the disk would have been initially vapor ), but in the recently proposed high-AM models, the disk would have been largely vaporized <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2014</ref>). Modeling the structure and evolution of partially vaporized disks is challenging since the material in the disk is comprised of multiple phases and multiple chemical components. It is necessary to make a number of simplifying assumptions to make the problem tractable. The simplest disk models are N -body simulations that neglect the vapor in the disk and treat the disk material as fully condensed particles (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ida et al., 1997</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kokubo et al., 2000</ref>). As the disk evolves under gravitational forces, material with an orbit that intersects the planet is assumed to be lost from the disk and is removed from the simulation.</p><p>More advanced disk models have made approximations of the multiphase physics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson and Stevenson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ward, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Ward, , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Ward, , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Canup, 2012, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Canup et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015)</ref>. Typically, particles of condensate are assumed to experience mutual collisions that damp the eccentricity and inclination of their orbits. Outside the Roche limit, the vapor is assumed to condense quickly and the condensate rapidly collides together to form moonlets. Inside the Roche limit, the condensate separates from the gas and forms a liquid layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Ward, 2012)</ref> or froth ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Thompson and Stevenson, 1988</ref>) in the midplane of the disk, surrounded by a vapor atmosphere. Viscosity in the disk causes the inner disk to spread and the surface density distribution to evolve. As in N -body simulations, material that spreads inside the radius of the planet is assumed lost from the disk, although some preliminary work has considered a more complex inner boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Desch and Taylor, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015)</ref>. Although the above assumptions are the most important for our discussion here, a number of other assumptions are made in different models of the inner disk, including: a constant surface density (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Canup, 2012, 2014</ref>), neglecting the radial pressure gradient (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015)</ref> and using a single component equation of state (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Ward, 2012</ref>). All the disk models are initialized with conditions that are based on the conventional analysis described above and evolve under the assumption of unfettered mass flow to the planet.</p><p>Our work identifies several issues with the assumptions made in previous studies of post-impact structures and circumterrestrial disks. First, post-impact structures cannot always be divided into a planet and disk that can be modeled separately. For synestias, the corotating region and the disk-like region are continuous, as demonstrated by the angular velocity and thermodynamic profiles of the structure shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9E</ref>-H. In such cases, calculating the structure or evolution of a region of the structure without considering the whole will lead to substantial errors. Even for sub-CoRoL structures, there can be significant pressures (∼1000's bar in the transition region between the corotating and disk-like regions, e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10A</ref>), due to the high specific entropy of the material. In such cases, the structure and evolution of the disk-like region cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of the structure because the influence of the vapor in the corotating and transition regions is not negligible. Due to the hot thermal state of the corotating and transition regions, the definition of the planet in the conventional analysis does not correspond to the inner edge of the disk-like region in the post-impact structure. For example, for the structure shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9A</ref>-D, in the conventional analysis the mass of the planet is 0.98M Earth using the iterative routine of  and 0.95M Earth using the approach of´Cukof´ of´Cuk and Stewart (2012). The combined mass of the planet and atmosphere using the ( ´ Cuk and Stewart, 2012) approach is 0.99M Earth . In contrast, the mass of the corotating region in the SPH post-impact structure is only 0.88M Earth but the radius of the corotating region extends out to ∼6500 km, similar to the radius of the planet defined in the conventional analysis, 6532 km or 6691 km. The hot vapor in the transition region extends out to beyond 8000 km, much greater than the conventional radius of the planet. Thus, the inner edge of the disk-like region is much farther out than assumed in the conventional analysis. The thickness of the transition region may be dependent on the viscosity of the vapor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Desch and Taylor, 2013)</ref> and the thickness may not be captured accurately in SPH. However, even if the transition region was much thinner, the large radius of the hot inner portion of the structure cannot be ignored.</p><p>Second, mass and AM cannot simply be lost from the disk-like regions of a structure to the planet. The pressure at the interface between the corotating and disk-like regions in most structures is high (10 3 -10 4 bar) and these regions tend to be majority vapor. Vapor cannot simply flow across the boundary because of the pressure gradient. The fate of condensed mass in the disk that falls or spreads inwards is more complicated. Falling condensate would encounter the high specific entropy of the corotating and transition regions, thermally equilibrate and vaporize. Vaporizing condensates could increase the pressure support in the corotating region and, in turn, the disk-like region. Increasing the vapor pressure could add vapor mass to the disk-like region, particularly in the case of synestias. The magnitude of the effect of the infalling condensate depends on the balance between the potential energy released by the falling condensates and the redistribution of thermal energy. Crucially, mass cannot flow irretrievably from the disk-like region to the corotating region, and previous studies have artificially depleted the mass in the disk-like region.</p><p>Third, the redistribution of the disk mass onto Keplerian orbits in the conventional analysis produces unrealistically compact surface density distributions for multiphase disks. In post-impact structures the disk-like regions are typically a variable mixture of condensate and vapor (for example, see the range of specific entropies in <ref type="figure">Figure 9C</ref>,G,K). The condensates are not supported by the pressure gradient in the vapor. If the condensates decouple from the vapor then they would fall inwards via buoyancy forces. The codes that are typically used in giant impact studies do not include the separation of vapor and condensed phases. This inability of the impact code to model multiphase behavior is the rationale behind the redistribution of mass in the conventional analysis. The conventional analysis assumes that the mass fraction of vapor is small and so the effect of vapor pressure is neglected. However, for disk-like regions that are substantially vaporized, the vapor pressure cannot be neglected. Even assuming condensate is decoupled from the vapor, the pressure gradient can support the fraction of mass that is vapor on orbits at greater semi-major axes than purely Keplerian orbits. If the condensates are coupled to the vapor, then the whole mass of the disk can be supported by pressure gradient forces. If there is a substantial fraction of vapor, the conventional analysis produces a surface density distribution that is more compact than a pressure-supported disk. In impacts where the majority of the disk-like region is vaporized (e.g., the example in <ref type="figure">Figure 9E-H)</ref>, the structure of the disk-like region is correctly modeled by the impact code, given sufficient resolution and time for the structure to reach quasi-equilibrium (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figures 9E-H and 10D-F)</ref>. In these cases, no post-simulation redistribution of mass is necessary. Even so, there is a technical difficulty in calculating the post-impact structure for a particular impact even in completely vapor structures. The numerical viscosity in the SPH code leads to some redistribution of mass and AM on the dynamical timescales required for the structure to gravitationally equilibrate. For the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10D</ref>-F, the mass outside of Roche increased by a few tenths of a lunar mass over days of simulation time. Thus, the equilibrium structure evolves over the calculation time. Given that the real viscosity in the structure is poorly constrained, there is uncertainty in the predicted post-impact structure for a specific impact scenario. In a mixed phase disk, more careful analysis is needed to correctly model the dynamics and thermodynamics of liquid and vapor both during the impact and in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>It is possible to quantify the error that is introduced in analyzing the output of an impact simulation using the conventional analysis in the case that the disk-like region is majority vapor. There is initially no phase separation and the code used to simulate the impact can accurately model the hydrostatic post-impact structure. For cases similar to the Moon-forming impacts proposed by´Cukby´ by´Cuk and Stewart (2012), the conventional analysis artificially decreases the mass of the disk-like region by several lunar masses. The surface density of the disk-like region is correspondingly reduced as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>. The black line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 14</ref> shows the true surface density of the structure and the surface density of the disk in the conventional analysis is given in red. The blue dashed line shows the original position of the disk material in the conventional analysis. The mass depletion of the disk-like region is strongest close to the planet and far from the rotational axis. Thus, the mass in the disk-like regions can be substantially reduced by the conventional analysis. For the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>, the mass beyond Roche is reduced from 1.7 to 0.5 lunar masses. Note that the surface density of the disklike regions within a synestia (black line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> is not constant with radius as assumed in some disk evolution models. In most impact cases, some mass is injected into orbits far from the central mass. This mass will cool rapidly and can be modeled as pure condensate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson (2014)</ref> have previously noted the significance of pressure gradients in the structure of highly vaporized post-impact structures. They analyzed the disk structures generated by specific examples of canonical, high-energy and high-AM, and intermediate giant impacts. They found that, in the disk-like regions of high-energy, high-AM structures, the specific AM was nearly constant with radius, due to strong pressure support. Such structures are likely to be unstable by the Rayleigh criteria. As a result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nakajima and Stevenson (2014)</ref> redistributed the mass in the high-energy, high-AM cases assuming an arbitrary stable surface density profile that conserved the mass and AM of the disk. However, they calculated the disk mass and AM to be conserved using the conventional analysis. The disk mass was significantly depleted by the use of the conventional analysis, and the calculated disks have less mass than found in the disk-like region of synestias formed under the same impact conditions. Given the significant errors in the structure calculated using the conventional approach, it is important that better techniques are developed to analyze the results of giant impact simulations. For vapor dominated synestias, we suggest that removing the escaping mass from an SPH simulation and calculating the hydrostatic structure of the bound mass provides a reasonable estimate of the postimpact structure, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 10</ref>. In addition, the treatment of the interface between the corotating and disk-like regions in disk evolution models requires significant technical developments (as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015</ref>).</p></div>

The material outside the Roche limit condenses and accretes quickly (on a timescale of weeks) to form a proto-moon. The proto-moon temporarily confines the edge of the Rocheinterior liquid-vapor disk via resonant interactions. As the Roche-interior fluid disk cools and viscously spreads both inwards and outwards, moonlets whose orbits are raised beyond the Roche limit are accreted onto the proto-moon on a timescale of 100's of years ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Machida and Abe, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Salmon and Canup, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut, 2015)</ref>. The multiphase dynamics of a canonical circumterrestrial disk are challenging to model, and our understanding of the physical processes in the disk is incomplete. For example, most studies of the canonical disk evolution make an assumption of energy balance between viscous spreading of the Roche-interior disk and radiative cooling; however, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Charnoz and Michaut (2015)</ref> have shown that radiative cooling dominates the system. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that canonical disk models must include the vapor pressure support from the corotating region.</p><p>Satellite accretion from the various post-impact structures described here can be fundamentally different than accretion from a canonical circumterrestrial disk. Postimpact synestias can have a much higher surface density in the disk-like region (e.g., <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>). Consequently, the cooling time of vapor beyond the Roche limit reaches timescales relevant for satellite formation. For example,  estimate that substantial vapor pressure (&gt; bars) can persist at the Roche limit for 10's of years after the impact for the synestia example in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 9E</ref>-H. Synestias do not have a shear boundary between the corotating region and disk-like region, and therefore, the whole structure can mix more easily than in the sub-CoRoL structures formed in canonical giant impacts. Condensates that decouple from the vapor in the lowest surface density regions beyond the Roche limit have angular momenta such that they orbit within the vapor structure. In some cases, the proto-moon may form beyond the Roche limit and grow to near its final mass while remaining within the Earth-composition vapor of the synestia.  proposed that accretion within an impactgenerated synestia can explain the isotopic and chemical properties of our Moon. A future paper will investigate the evolution of synestias and the formation of our Moon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Planet formation with hot rocky bodies</head><p>We have shown that partially vaporized post-impact bodies are common during accretion ( §5); however, the implications of the highly variable thermal and physical structures of such bodies on the formation of terrestrial planets have not been considered. Here we comment on a few key areas of planet formation affected by the possible range of planetary structures: accretion efficiency, core formation, and chemical evolution. At present, models of the accretion of terrestrial planets do not account for changes in thermal state. The physical size of planetesimals and planets are usually calculated by assuming a fixed bulk density over the entire calculation (typically 3 g cm −3 in N -body codes, e.g., ). For rotating rocky bodies with the highest specific entropy cases considered here, the bulk density could be an order of magnitude lower. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 15</ref> presents the bulk density and areal cross sections for the suite of Earth-mass bodies shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>. Partial vaporization is accompanied by a significant decrease in bulk density for all rotational states. Post-impact states can be significantly larger than isolated bodies with even lower density and larger cross sections. All giant impacts results in some inflation of the radius of a body. The larger sizes of hot rocky planets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 4</ref>) translate to larger collisional cross sections and an increased probability of impacts, and hence more efficient accretion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 15 B,C)</ref>. In particular, the expanded cross section of a body after an impact will increase the fraction of impact debris reaccreted in the early time period before the debris can be perturbed from crossing orbits. In proposed Moon-forming giant impacts, typically a few to several lunar masses of material is ejected , which is accreted onto the Earth and nearby planets within ∼10 Myr under current assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jackson and Wyatt, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bottke et al., 2015)</ref>. It has been suggested that the warm debris disks produced by giant impacts would be observable around other stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jackson and Wyatt, 2012)</ref>. But recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kenyon et al. (2016)</ref> noted that the observed occurrence rate of warm debris disks around young stars is much lower than what would be expected from the prevalence of extra-solar rocky planets around mature stars and current planet formation models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kenyon et al. (2016)</ref> inferred that terrestrial planet formation must be quick and neat, with efficient reaccretion of impact-produced debris. Realistic capture cross sections of planets could be a factor in explaining such observations and should be included in planet formation studies.</p><p>The final stages of core formation in rocky planets is expected to occur during, or in the aftermath of, giant impacts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rubie et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rubie et al., , 2015</ref>. The pressure and temperature profiles with depth depend on the thermal and rotational state of the post-impact body. The partitioning of elements between the mantle and core is controlled by the pressure and temperature at which core and mantle materials equilibrate. Most studies of Earth's accretion assume that core material equilibrates at temperatures between the liquidus and solidus (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rubie et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Rubie et al., , 2015</ref>. However, in the impact simulations summarized in <ref type="figure">Figures 11 and 12</ref>, much of the post-impact body has temperatures far above the liquidus, with some sections potentially above the solvus for silicate-iron mixtures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wahl and Militzer, 2015)</ref>. In contrast, the lowermost mantle of post-impact states is much colder and potentially partially solid <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Solomatov, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nakajima and Stevenson, 2015</ref>). The superheated post-impact structure is important for core formation because the time for the whole structure to cool below the liquidus is much longer than the settling time for iron. Metal-silicate equilibration in the aftermath of giant impacts can occur over a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, which affects partitioning of elements between the mantle and the core. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Badro et al. (2016)</ref> recently argued that core formation at very high mantle temperatures would result in the partitioning of magnesium into the core which could provide a substantial power source for the terrestrial dynamo . The thermal and rotational states of bodies after giant impacts is therefore critical to understanding the conditions of core formation and interpreting the observed chemical tracers.</p><p>Upon cooling, the partially vaporized structures formed by giant impacts reach a thermal state associated with a conventional magma ocean planet, where the silicates are liquid and overlain by an atmosphere comprised of volatile compounds (e.g., H 2 O, CO/CO 2 , N 2 , Ar, etc.). However, the stage of evolution between the post-impact state and a magma ocean has been largely ignored in previous studies of planet formation. During this period the structure is evolving rapidly, leading to changing pressure and temperature conditions in the body. The rapid cooling of the body is likely to drive convection and potentially mix large fractions of the body, establishing the thermal and chemical structure of the magma ocean. Understanding this process is critical to understanding the possible survival of distinct geochemical signatures that predate the Moonforming giant impact ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rizo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mukhopadhyay, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pet˝ o et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tucker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Parai et al., 2012</ref>). Furthermore, the period after an impact is also the time of highest impactor flux due to the reaccretion of impact debris. It has been suggested that bombardment from a population of small bodies (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Schlicht- ing et al., 2015)</ref> or from single large bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Genda and Abe, 2005;</ref>) could remove significant amounts of atmosphere, and hence volatile elements, from terrestrial planets that are cold enough to have a liquid or solid surface and atmosphere. Impact erosion of planetary atmospheres has also been invoked as a possible process to fractionate Earth's budget of volatile elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014</ref>). Temporarily, typical hot postimpact structures do not have a distinct boundary between a vapor atmosphere and a liquid or solid surface. The corotating region of the structure grades smoothly from a silicate vapor to a supercritical fluid. Removal of volatiles by impacts is less efficient when the silicate potion of a body is partially vaporized as the impact energy is not efficiently deposited in a single shock at the planets surface but instead the impactor is gradually slowed by the continuous density gradient in the structure. Furthermore, during the period with substantial silicate vapor, the silicate components are more abundant than the volatile components in the atmosphere, and material ejected by small impactors is likely to be dominated by silicate components rather than volatiles. Thus, volatile loss by impacts may be inefficient during the hot post-impact period. More work is needed to understand the key phase in terrestrial planet evolution between giant impacts and magma oceans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.7.">Exoplanets</head><p>Around other stars, super-Earth size planets are common ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Morton et al., 2016)</ref>. For the Kepler mission, superEarths were defined by radii between 1.25 and 2R <ref type="bibr">Earth (Borucki et al., 2011</ref>). The composition of super-Earths appear to span cool rocky bodies to partially gaseous bodies, with a possible composition transition around 1.5R <ref type="bibr">Earth (Weiss and Marcy, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rogers, 2015)</ref>. However, the rocky portions of such planets have been assumed to have a high bulk density, based on the mass-radius relationships for cold bodies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Valencia et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Swift et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Zeng and Sasselov, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Zeng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Unter- born et al., 2016)</ref>. The equilibrium surface temperatures of exoplanets are generally higher than the terrestrial bodies in our solar system, and a few known cases are even hot enough to consider a surface with partially vaporized silicates (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kepler-78b (Sanchis-Ojeda et al., 2013</ref>) and 55 Cancri e <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Demory et al., 2016)</ref>).</p><p>Planets with a bulk density less than cold rock or ice are assumed to have a substantial volatile gas mass fraction. Our calculation of the bulk density of high specific entropy rocky bodies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 15A</ref>) overlaps those typically associated with ice giant and gas giant planets (e.g., at densities below ∼3000 kg m −3 ).</p><p>Furthermore, the rotational distortion of exoplanets can be significant, producing highly asymmetric bodies <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Fig- ure 15B,C)</ref>. Significantly, this effect is largest for hot rocky planets where substantial rotational flattening can be achieved even at modest spin periods of several hours. Most of the rocky exoplanets discovered so far are close to their host stars and expected to be tidally locked or in spin-orbit resonances (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Correia and Laskar, 2010)</ref>. However, the rotational states of exoplanets further from their host stars are unknown and a range of rotation rates must be considered for the formation and evolution of exoplanets. If, in calculating the planetary size from transit measurements, the areal cross section of significantly flattened exoplanets are interpreted as spherical, the viewing angle could lead to a significant error in the inferred volume of the planet. The structures of hot and/or rotating rocky bodies should be considered when inferring the possible compositions of exoplanets. Future work will use the HERCULES code to calculate mass-radius relationships for rocky bodies that include thermal and rotational effects and the structures of planets with hot, rocky interiors and varying molecular atmospheres.</p><p>Super-Earths are also expected to form via giant impacts in a manner similar to the accretion of our terrestrial planets <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chambers, 2010)</ref>. As noted in §5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda (2010)</ref> found that 0.25 to 1.75 M Earth planets had a similar average angular velocity at the end of accretion. Accounting for the planetary structure assumptions made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kokubo and Genda (2010)</ref>, the average AM of rocky planets scales as ∼M 5/3 , where M is the planetary mass. If this result holds for systems that form more massive planets, the mean AM of hot super-Earths is expected to exceed the CoRoL, which scales with mass by a similar power law <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 8)</ref>. Therefore, we expect that synestias also form during the accretion of super-Earths. Because some exoplanets are much closer to their star, the cooling time of synestias may be much longer than for planets in our solar system. The large population of exoplanets is used to test general planet formation theories. If the physical properties of hot rocky planets are an important factor during general planet formation, the large population of super-Earths may be the most promising target for detailed investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.8.">Giant planets and stars</head><p>Angular momentum and disk formation are central topics in the formation of stars (e.g., Bodenheimer, 1995) and giant planets (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Peale and Canup, 2015)</ref>. In most cases, disk evolution is studied without explicitly calculating the structure of the central object, as has been the case with the lunar disk. However, a few studies have calculated structures for stars and giant planets that are similar to the synestias found in this work. Here, we discuss examples of such structures and compare them to terrestrial synestias.</p><p>Ostriker and Bodenheimer (1968) calculated theoretical structures for massive white dwarfs. They found solutions for rapidly rotating structures with imposed AM profiles, including cases that resulted in a central quasi-corotating region and differentially rotating outer region. They argued that the structures, which exceed the corotation limit calculated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">James (1964)</ref>, are stable. The structures are morphologically similar to the synestias calculated here, e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Ostriker and Bodenheimer (1968)</ref>. These differentially rotating structures are consistent with the inferred angular velocities of white dwarfs.</p><p>Bodenheimer (1971) extended the previous work to massive main sequence stars. By systematically increasing the total AM, with different imposed AM profiles, he found that the equilibrium structures of the stars varied significantly. Again, solutions with differential rotation have morphological similarities to synestias (see his <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>). These structures are expected to be transient while main sequence stars shed AM.</p><p>Early studies of the formation of gas giant planets considered the contraction of a gas cloud. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bodenheimer (1977)</ref> found that it was possible to contract into a configuration with a central planet connected to a circumplanetary disk (e.g., his <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>). These structures, with different imposed AM profiles, are morphologically similar to the synestias generated here for terrestrial bodies. These early models of gas giant planet formation in isolation have been superseded by studies that include transfer of material from the protoplanetary disk (see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Peale and Canup, 2015)</ref>. In isolated contraction models, a so-called spin-out disk forms because the contracting body cannot absorb all of the original AM in the cloud. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Ward and Canup (2010)</ref> proposed that although the early stages of the formation of circumplanetary disks around gas giants may include a spin-out stage, the system must transition to an accretion disk fed by the protoplanetary disk. The details of the formation of gas giants and their satellites are not settled, and the connection between the central planetary structure and satellite-forming disk has not been fully incorporated into existing models.</p><p>In these examples of other rapidly rotating astrophysical objects, the structures share many similarities to the terrestrial synestias. They are continuous in density, monotonic in the angular velocity profile and typically have extended or flared outer regions. However, unlike the terrestrial synestias, the angular velocity profiles for the outer regions of these other astrophysical bodies are not strictly Keplerian because of the imposed AM profile. In our impact-generated synestias, the AM profiles were not imposed. The distribution of mass and AM between the corotating region and disk-like region was determined by the impact conditions. As for the case of terrestrial bodies, if gas giant planets and stars form synestias during their formation and evolution, a full understanding of the evolution of the system may require direct consideration of the physical structure of the central object.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>The physical structure of planetary bodies provides the essential framework needed to investigate planet formation and evolution. Assumptions about structure influence the inquiry of physical and chemical processes. The models for planetary structure that have been used to date have typically been simple, such as the constant-density bodies in N -body simulations of accretion. However, planetary structure can vary significantly during formation and evolution. In particular, during accretion terrestrial bodies can be forced into hot, rapidly rotating states by giant impacts, and there is a need for a better understanding of such structures.</p><p>Calculating the structure of hot, rapidly rotating rocky bodies is particularly challenging because of the need to include substantial flattening and multiple phases in the equation of state. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a flexible new code, HERCULES, that can calculate the physical structure of planetary bodies with varying thermal and rotational states. HERCULES solves for the axisymmetric shape and internal profile of a planet, given the mass, compositional layering, specific entropy profile, and AM.</p><p>In this work, we investigated the structure of Earth-like bodies over a wide range of thermal and rotational states.</p><p>We found a that the size and shape of Earth-like bodies varies considerably over the expected range of internal energy and AM during accretion. We showed that there is a corotation limit for the structure of terrestrial bodies that depends on mass, compositional layering, thermal state and AM. We have named super-CoRoL structures synestias. Synestias typically consist of an inner corotating region connected to an outer disk-like region. By analyzing the results of N -body simulations of planet formation, we found that high-entropy, highly vaporized postimpact states are common during terrestrial planet accretion. Given the estimated range of planetary AM during the giant impact stage, we find that many post-impact structures are likely to be synestias.</p><p>The occurrence of partially vaporized post-impact states during accretion significantly affects various aspects of planet formation. The inclusion of realistic post-impact states into models of growing bodies is needed to understand the history of terrestrial planets. In particular, the dynamics and evolution of synestias are fundamentally different than traditional models of planets surrounded by a dynamically distinct disk. Previous analyses of the structure of the Earth and a circumterrestrial disk made assumptions that are violated when a synestia is created.</p><p>The large population of exoplanets, with larger rocky bodies and higher stellar flux compared to our solar system, offers an opportunity to apply our new understanding of hot, rotating rocky planetary structures. Future work will include the calculation of mass-radius curves for a range of rocky bodies with varying thermal and rotational states. The HERCULES code is an efficient tool for calculating planetary structures and may be integrated into studies of many aspects of planet formation and evolution that have previously been neglected.</p><p>Supplementary materials for "The structure of terrestrial bodies: Impact heating, corotation limits and synestias" </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S1. HERCULES code</head><p>We have developed a new code for calculating the equilibrium structure of rapidly rotating, fluid bodies. The HERCULES (Highly Eccentric Rotating Concentric U (potential) Layers Equilibrium Structure) code improves on the concentric Maclaurin spheroid  by allowing the calculation of the structure of rapidly rotating bodies. Additionally, HERCULES can also solve for the structure of a body that is consistent with material equations of state (EOS) and conserves the mass and AM of a body.</p><p>In HERCULES, a body is modeled as a series of nested, constant density spheroids <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>, with the surface of each spheroid an equipotential surface. The structure of the body is found by iteratively solving for the shape, density, and equatorial radius of each of the spheroids, and the rotational velocity of the body. Fundamental to finding the equilibrium structure is the calculation of the gravitational potential due to each of the individual spheroids, in order to determine the equipotential surfaces. In §S1.1, we summarize the calculation of the potential for a single constant density spheroid. We then describe the HERCULES code in §S1.2.</p></div>

Alternatively, Hubbard (2012) formulated an expression for the gravitational potential due to a single, constant-density spheroid as an expansion in Legendre polynomials. However, as identified by , the expression formulated by Hubbard (2012) does not converge for bodies that are more oblate than a certain limit if the radius of the point for which the potential is being calculated is between the equatorial and polar radius of the body, i.e., if b &lt; r &lt; a where a and b are the equatorial and polar radii of the spheroid respectively.  provided a solution to the potential due to a Maclaurin spheroid as an expansion in Legendre polynomials that converges for significantly oblate bodies in the case that b &lt; r &lt; a.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S1.2. Concentric layer model S1.2.1. Model overview</head><p>In the HERCULES code, the body is modeled as a series of N lay nested spheroids with uniform density, δρ i . Although we refer to the volumes as spheroids, in our formulation, the equipotential surfaces can be any rotationally symmetric surface whose radius decreases monotonically from equator to pole. Spheroids are numbered so that the 0th spheroid defines the surface of the body with numbers increasing inwards <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). The surface of each spheroid is an equipotential surface, with the same numbering as the spheroids. The radius of equipotential surface i at µ S4 is denoted˜rdenoted˜ denoted˜r i (µ) Normalized radii for each surface, ˜ ξ i (µ), are normalized by the equatorial radius of that surface, i.e. ˜ ξ i (µ) = ˜ r i (µ)/a i . Each equipotential surface is defined by N µ linearly spaced µ points. The equatorial and polar radii of an equipotential surface, or equivalently spheroid, i are a i and b i respectively.</p><p>The regions of the body between the equipotential surfaces are referred to as layers. The layers are numbered by the equipotential surface at the top of the layer. The mass distribution in the planet is given by the superposition of the mass of each of the constant density spheroids. All mass located between the two equipotential surfaces defining a layer is considered to be part of that layer. The total density, ρ i , of a given layer is the sum of the densities of all the spheroids that are larger than the spheroid that defines the inner edge of that layer, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ρ j = i≤j δρ i ,<label>(S20)</label></formula><p>with ρ 0 = δρ 0 . Layers are divided into N mat material layers, e.g. silicate and iron, with material layers numbered from the outside in, beginning from zero. The material a layer is made of dictates the equation of state (EOS) used in relating pressure to the density of the layer. The mass of material layers are also conserved separately (see §S1.2.4).</p><p>The body is rotating at an angular velocity, ω rot . The equilibrium structure of a body is found using a multi-staged iteration. Firstly the shape of the equipotential surfaces is found, based on the mass distribution from the previous iteration. The shape of the constant density spheroids is then adjusted to match the equipotential surfaces. A separate conservation iterative routine alters the radii of each layer to conserve the mass of each of the material layers and the angular velocity of the body is recalculated to conserve the total AM (see §S1.2.4 and §S1.2.5). Within the conservation iteration, the density of the spheroids is altered to be consistent with the hydrostatic pressure profile and the given material EOS ( §S1.2.3). The shape and conservation iterations are then repeated until the convergence criteria are met (see §S1.2.6).</p></div>

In the CMS model, all the integrals are over a fixed interval 0 → 1 allowing the use of Gaussian quadrature points for µ and highly precise integration. In the iterative equation used in the HERCULES code, there is not a fixed domain of integration and so Gaussian quadrature points cannot be used. Instead, we use equally spaced µ but this decreases the precision that is computationally feasible.</p></div>

Briefly: n int is the maximum number of shape iterations; χ toll is the tolerance for the shape iteration; n ξ int is the maximum number of conservation iterations; χ ξ toll is the tolerance for the conservation iteration; δξ is the step size used to calculate gradients in the shape iteration; N lay is the number of concentric spheroids; N mat lay is the number of layers used to describe each material; M j is the mass of each material; 2kmax is the highest spherical harmonic degree term used in the iterative equation; Nµ is the number of points used to describe each equipotential; and p min is the bounding pressure of the body.

The pressure used to pass to the EOS is the average of the pressures at the top and bottom of the layer. This approximates the pressure in the middle of the layer, assuming that the variation in potential is roughly linear over the region between layers.

We used the same parameters as used in the rest of this work <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S1)</ref>; N µ = 1000, and including terms up to spherical harmonic degree 12 (k max = 6). For these parameters the HERCULES code is able to calculate the gravitational moments of Maclaurin spheroids with extreme rotational flattening to better than 1% ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>).</p><p>The maximum fractional error in finding the surface, i.e., ˜ r(µ), of the two ellipsoids shown in <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref> is on the order 10 −6 and 10 −3 for the slow and fast rotation cases respectively. The fractional errors in the calculated potential at the surface of the ellipsoid are on the order 10 −8 and 10 −3 . The majority of the discrepancy for the high flattening case comes from not including higher order terms in the expansion, as can be shown by running simulations with higher k max .  <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>: Reproducibility of Maclaurin spheroid gravitational moments using HERCULES. Plotted here are the errors in the gravitational moments, as a function of degree, for equilibrium structures calculated using HERCULES for a constant density body relative to the analytical solution for a Maclaurin spheroid. Shown are examples for a spheroid with minor flattening (black, aspect ratio = 0.98, = 0.2) and extreme rotational flattening (red, aspect ratio = 0.47, = 1.9). The equipotential surfaces were calculated using HER-CULES with Nµ = 1000 and kmax = 6. Both absolute error (dashed lines) and fractional error (solid lines) are shown. The large fractional error in the high degree gravitational moments for the minor flattening case is due to the magnitude of the moments being very small.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S8</head><p>We also tested the structure calculated by HERCULES for a planet with a density structure described by a polytrope of index one that has moderate rotational flattening. The barotrope for such a structure is</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">p = Kρ 2 , (S59)</formula><p>where K is a constant scaling factor set to conserve mass for a body with a given equatorial radius. Rotating planets obeying this barotrope have been extensively studied (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hubbard, 1975)</ref> and, in particular, Hubbard (2013) calculated the gravitational moments for the degree-1 polytrope case using the CMS model, allowing us to make direct comparisons. The gravitational moments of a planet with the mass, equatorial radius and rotational period of Jupiter calculated using a 3rd-order expansion in q ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hubbard, 1975</ref>) and the CMS model with varying numbers of concentric spheroids  are shown in Table S2. q is a dimensionless parameter that describes the relative magnitude of rotational and gravitational forces in a body and is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">q = ω rot a 3 0 GM . (S60)</formula><p>q is commonly used in small parameter expansions to approximate the structure of rotating bodies. For comparison, <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> shows the gravitational moments for the same body calculated using HERCULES for varying number and arrangement of spheroids. The bounding pressure was set to zero, but otherwise we used the standard set of parameters as elsewhere in this study. To give an indication of the relative differences between the calculated gravitational moments we have included in both tables the difference between each value and those found using the CMS model with N lay = 512. The agreement between HERCULES and previous results for polytropic structures depends strongly on the number and arrangement of concentric spheroids used. For 100 layers evenly spaced in radius, the gravitational moments are larger than those found using the CMS method by several percent. The gravitational moments are most sensitive to the outer layers of the structure and for 100 evenly spaced layers the scale height at the top of the polytropic structure is poorly sampled. A large (&gt;∼1000) number of evenly spaced layers would be needed to resolve the scale height in the outer regions of the structure. As an alternative, we used logarithmically spaced layers, so that the layers are concentrated at larger radii. For logarithmically spaced layers the disagreement between HERCULES and the previously calculated results fall to a few tenths of a percent even with just 100 layers. The structure is also resolved to much lower pressure. The agreement continues to improve with the addition of more logarithmically spaced layers and becomes similar to, or better than, the agreement between the CMS model using 256 and 512 layers. From this we conclude that the HERCULES code <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>: A comparison of literature values of the gravitational moments calculated for a Jupiter-like body using a 3rd-order expansion in q ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Hubbard, 1975</ref>) and the CMS model with varying numbers of concentric spheroids . q = 0.089195487 for all bodies. We present both the absolute value of each moment and the fractional difference of that calculation to the value found using the CMS model with N lay = 512. In this work we used a number of material layers with the evenly spaced concentric layers within each material. We concentrated layers in the outer material layers to give better resolution at the edge of the structure. For structures that are vapor in their outer regions, such as the majority of the structures considered in this work, the scale height in the outer regions is large and the resolution we have used is sufficient to resolve the outer structure. In cases that are mostly condensed at the surface the scale height becomes comparable to the radial resolution. In such cases the lack of resolution in the outer layers can cause small (a few percent) errors in the properties of the outer structure. This can be seen by comparing structures found using different radial resolutions (see §S3). As our work focuses on mostly vaporized bodies this does not significantly affect our results but is important to bare in mind for future studies of condensed planets using HER-CULES.</p></div>

HERCULES parameter sensitivity tests</head><p>The HERCULES parameters used in this study, unless otherwise noted, are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table S1</ref>. These parameters were chosen as a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency to allow us to explore a wide parameter space. Here we examine the effect of a few of these parameters on our results.</p><p>We tested the sensitivity of the calculated equatorial radii of individual bodies to the number of concentric layers used, N lay . We ran sets of corotating, Earth-mass bodies with constant entropy mantles using N lay = 50 and N lay = 100 and compared them to our results using N lay = 200 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table S5</ref>). The equatorial radius of bodies varied by up to a few percent between the different resolutions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S3</ref>). The difference is largest for the most oblate bodies, close to the CoRoL. This increase is due to the extended structure increasing the sensitivity of the model to the radial resolution. The difference is particularly large for the S lower = 4.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 isentropic silicate thermal profile, as the very small scale height of the condensate dominated atmosphere is not resolved well with equally spaced layers. The number of layers that are used to model this region of the structure can therefore substantially change the equatorial radius, and so the structure is sensitive to the radial resolution. The number of concentric layers used also has little effect on the CoRoL boundary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S4)</ref>. Again, the only exception is for the S lower = 4.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 isentropic silicate thermal profile as the CoRoL is sensitive to the equatorial radius of a body. In all cases, the small dependence of the calculated structures and the CoRoL on the number of concentric layers is not significant for this work.</p><p>In HERCULES, a number of points, N µ , is used to describe each equipotential surface. For this study we have chosen to use N µ = 1000. To test whether the value of N µ used affects the calculated structure, we have used HER-CULES to calculate the properties of bodies with constant entropy mantle thermal profile (class I) with a specific entropy of S lower = 6.5 kJ K −1 kg −1 using a range of N µ . The location of the CoRoL and the extrapolated properties at the CoRoL vary little compared to the N µ = 1000 case for sufficiently large values of N µ ( <ref type="figure">Figure S5A</ref>). The properties of bodies below the CoRoL also does not vary significantly with different numbers of surface points <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure S5B, C)</ref>. We are therefore confident that the N µ used in this study is sufficient for our purposes.</p><p>We have also considered the effect of the exterior bounding pressure used in our model on the CoRoL. We find that the CoRoL varies significantly based on the bounding pressure, particularly for high-entropy planets where the scale height of the outer portion of the planet is large ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S6</ref>). This demonstrates once again the sensitivity of the CoRoL to the thermal structure of the planet. The thermal profiles used in this study did not consider the intricacies of the structure at low pressure where the effects of radiative transfer could be significant . Given the sensitivity of planetary structure to the thermal structure at low pressure, there must be further work done on understanding the thermal structure of partially vapor- <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>: A comparison of the gravitational moments calculated for a Jupiter-like body by HERCULES using different numbers and arrangements of spheroids.

Each of the terms in the definition of Q S (Equation S61) takes into account a factor that affects how efficiently energy is coupled into the shock pressure field in the impacting bodies. Thus the parameter is proportional to the entropy increase in the impacting bodies. The first factor corrects for the fact that a larger volume is shocked to peak pressure for more equal sized impacts. The second factor accounts for the fact that grazing impacts less efficiently couple impact energy into the target body, leading to a smaller volume reaching the highest shock pressures.  <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>: Summary of SPH impact simulations and properties of their post-impact states.
