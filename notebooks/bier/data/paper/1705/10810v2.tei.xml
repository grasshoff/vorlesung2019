			<abstract>
				<p>A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California-Kepler-Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is shown to be bimodal, with a &quot;valley&apos; separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R ⊕. Such an &quot;evaporation-valley&apos; had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because the planet&apos;s radius remains largely constant for tenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation therefore herds planets into either bare cores (∼ 1.3 R ⊕), or those with double the core&apos;s radius (∼ 2.6 R ⊕). This process mostly occurs during the first 100 Myrs when the stars&apos; high energy flux are high and nearly constant. The observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are clustered around 3 M ⊕ in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, while the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the photoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ∼ 30 − 60 days, if these planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for planet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Recent exoplanet discovery missions and targeted follow-up campaigns have fundamentally changed our understanding of what constitutes a "typical" planet (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Borucki et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marcy et al. 2014</ref>). Specifically, the most common type of exoplanets are smaller than Neptune (4 R ⊕ , e.g., <ref type="bibr">Youdin 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Howard et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Batalha et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Petigura et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burke et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Morton et al. 2016)</ref> and have masses of a few to tens of Earth masses. The fraction of sun-like stars that host at least one of these "Kepler" planets with an orbital period of less than 100 days is around 60-90% (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fressin et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Silburt et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mulders et al. 2016</ref>).</p><p>Combining transit measurements of a planet's radius with a measurement of its mass from transit-timing variations <ref type="bibr">(TTVs, Carter et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wu &amp; Lithwick 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hadden &amp; Lithwick 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Had- den &amp; Lithwick 2016)</ref> or radial-velocity (RV) follow-up (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Marcy et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Weiss &amp; Marcy 2014</ref>) quickly told us that many of these planets had compositions unlike the small terrestrial planets in our own solar system (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wolfgang et al. 2016</ref>). Rather than being completely solid, such planets are likely to be composed of a jowen@ias.edu wu@astro.utoronto.ca <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Hubble Fellow dense solid core surrounded by a voluminous volatile rich envelope. However, due to degeneracies present in the mass-radius plane at low-masses (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adams et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Rogers &amp; Seager 2010)</ref>, we cannot infer the compositions just based on the current measured mass and radius for the majority of the observed planets. These degeneracies can be broken by considering how the local environment effects the evolution of the planet. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wu &amp; Lithwick (2013)</ref> showed that closer-in planets tend to be denser, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ciardi et al. (2013)</ref> demonstrated that for pairs of planets in multi-planet systems, the inner planet tends to be smaller. These studies suggest that the envelopes are rich in hydrogen/helium. Orbiting close to their parent stars, the Kepler planets can receive, over a lifetime, an integrated high-energy irradiation (high-energy exposure) that is an appreciable fraction of their gravitational binding energy (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Lam- mer et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lecavelier Des Etangs 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis &amp; Wheatley 2009)</ref>, where this high-energy "exposure" is dominated by the first ∼ 100 Myr of the planet's lifetime (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jackson et al. 2012)</ref>. Planets with H/He-rich envelopes can be strongly evaporated by this irradiation (e.g. Yelle <ref type="bibr">2004</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tian et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Murray-Clay et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Owen &amp; Jackson 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Johnstone et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Erkaev et al. 2016)</ref>, and indeed H/He evaporation has been observed from the low-mass planet GJ 436b ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kulow et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ehrenreich et al. 2015</ref>). Evaporation naturally results in planets that are smaller and denser than those at large separations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lopez et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jin et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howe &amp; Burrows 2015)</ref>. For a planet with a low enough mass and a close enough orbit, its initial low-mass H/He envelope can even be entirely stripped, leaving behind a naked solid core. This explains the dearth of planets with any envelopes at short periods ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lundkvist et al. 2016</ref>). The core's mass and density play a primary role in controlling a planet's evolution by setting the escape velocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Owen &amp; Morton 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zahnle &amp; Catling 2017)</ref>, allowing one to break the compositional degeneracies in individual systems by statistical modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Owen &amp; Morton 2016)</ref>. While steam atmospheres are also expected to lose mass (as in the case of early <ref type="bibr">Venus -Kasting &amp; Pollack 1983</ref>) the evaporative histories of such planets are significantly different to those that contain H/He envelopes and therefore distinguishable <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lopez 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While the evaporation theory naturally explains why Kepler planets are larger and less dense further out, it also makes another major prediction: the existence of an "evaporation valley", a low-residence region in the radius-period plane between planets that have been completely stripped and those that are able to retain an envelope with roughly ∼ 1% in mass. The evaporation valley was first predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Owen &amp; Wu (2013)</ref> using numerical evolutionary studies for low-mass planets with pure rock (silicate) cores, and shortly after, by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2013)</ref> for different core compositions using a different evaporation model. The evaporation valley was further reproduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jin et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Rogers (2016)</ref>, again using different evaporation prescriptions and initial populations. The evaporation valley is thus a robust prediction of evaporative driven evolution of close-in H/He rich planets. This feature is largely independent of the assumed H/He evaporation model (energy-limited, recombination limited, UV driven, Xray driven etc.), and its creation also appears insensitive to the choice of initial conditions (for at least a reasonable range of starting conditions); however, the details of these choices do control it's properties (width, location with orbital period etc.).</p><p>The predicted occurrence valley, between stripped cores and those that retain a residual H/He envelope, is not particularly wide, with a radius width of ∼ 0.5 R ⊕ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref> of <ref type="bibr">Owen &amp; Wu 2013 and Fig. 9</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013)</ref>. Large planetary radius errors, stemming from uncertainties in the stellar radius, have previously hampered efforts to observationally solidify its presence in the observed exoplanet population (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Owen &amp; Wu 2013</ref>, for a preliminary analysis that suggested its presence). Recently, the California-Kepler Survey (CKS), using spectroscopic follow-up of a large (1305) sample of planet hosting Kepler stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Petigura et al. 2017</ref>) refined the planet parameters for 2025 Kepler planets, and reduced the typical planetary radius error to ∼ 10% ( <ref type="bibr">John- son et al. 2017</ref>). The CKS sample allowed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> to definitely reveal a valley in the planet occurrence rate in the planet radius -period plane: close-in planets predominantly have a radius of either ∼ 1.3 R ⊕ or 2.6 R ⊕ , while planets with a radius of 1.8 R ⊕ are considerably rarer, in spectacular agreement with the predicted evaporation driven evolution scenario for close-in exoplanets <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Owen &amp; Wu 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jin et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Rogers 2016)</ref>.</p><p>While the presence of the evaporation valley in numerical models is robust to changes in model assumptions, a clear physical, first-principle description of its origin is missing, along with an understanding of how its properties change with model assumptions such as the core composition and evaporation model, and even when or whether it could be made to disappear. This paper serves two purposes: firstly, we clearly explain the physics behind the origin of the evaporation-valley; secondly, we will perform a preliminary investigation into how the observed evaporation valley can break many of the composition degeneracies and make inferences about both the composition of the Kepler planets and how/where they formed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A MINIMAL ANALYTICAL MODEL</head><p>Here, we build a minimal model of an evolving planet under the influence of evaporation and cooling. The planet is assumed to consist of a solid core of mass M c , and radius R c , surrounded by a gaseous envelope whose equation of state can be described by the ideal gas law. Such a model allows us to determine the planet outer radius as a function of time and envelope mass. We then perform numerical checks to confirm these results. While a fully numerical study is straight-forward (and has been done), such an approach obscurates the underlying properties of low-mass exoplanet atmospheres that results in the evaporation valley. Furthermore, the analytical method sheds light on many of the parameter dependencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Radius versus envelope mass for a low-mass planet</head><p>Our goal here is to understand how the radius of the planet (R p ) changes with its envelope mass fraction (X = M env /M c ) with a view to calculating the mass-loss timescale. We consider low-mass envelopes (X &lt; 1), so the planet's mass is still dominated by the core. Therefore, we neglect the self-gravity of the planet's envelope. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Due to stellar insolation, the envelope is adiabatic (convective) in the deep interior and roughly isothermal (and radiative) near the surface. The roughly isothermal radiative cap satisfies T ∼ T eq (e.g. Rafikov 2006; <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lee &amp; Chiang 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ginzburg et al. 2016)</ref>, where the photospheric equilibrium temperature is set by stellar insolation. The radiative-convective boundary is assumed to occur at a density ρ rcb , and a radius R rcb . The planet's radius is set by the photospheric radius and is typically ∼ 6 pressure scale heights above R rcb (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014)</ref>, where the scale height H in the isothermal layer is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H R c = k B T eq µm H gR c ≈ 0.017 a 0.1 AU −1/2 M c 5 M ⊕ −3/4 R p 1.5 R ⊕ 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where we have estimated its value for a Sun-like host (mass 1 M , radius 1 R and effective temperature 5780 K) and for an envelope with a mean-molecular weight of µ = 2.35 (solar composition), surrounding a core with an earth-like composition (see eq. 15). So the isothermal radiative cap is geometrically thin. In the following derivation, we take the planet radius to be approximately R p ≈ R rcb , but correct for the isothermal layer thickness in all relevant places (including all figures).</p></div>

So, at a given planet size (∆R/R c ), the exponents in eq. (16) tell us the envelope mass is higher for a denser core composition (e.g., iron oxide vs. water ice), for an older planet, and for planets further away from their stars, all as expected. Furthermore, the nature of the opacity law makes the planet size a direct measure of the H/He envelope mass fraction, with weak sensitivities to all other factors. This has been noticed numerically in earlier works (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Rogers 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref> provide power-law fits to their numerical models over a wide range of parameter space, and the power-law indices listed in eq. (16) are similar to their results (eq. 4 in that paper, though theirs are fits for an "enhanced opacity" model, not solarmetallicity). A different opacity law may lead to very different results.

We do not consider an "effective absorption radius" or "expansion radius" (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baraffe et al. 2004</ref>) that accounts for the higher radius at which the high-energy flux is absorbed compared to the planet's radius, as this effect can always be folded into the efficiency factor. Such a radius is also difficult to define for X-ray driven evaporation (which is important for low-mass planets) as different wavelength photons can be absorbed at very different radii.

The photosphere radius is then at nH above the radiativeconvective boundary, with H being the local scale height, and n = ln(ρ rcb /ρ ph ), where ρ ph is the density at the photosphere. According to eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref>, the mass-loss timescale reaches a maximum at the point at which the radius is doubled (∆R ≈ R c , X = X 2 ). Such a behaviour arises because, below X 2 , the planet's radius is dominated by that of the core and is independent of the envelope mass. So the photoevaporation timescale decreases for lower envelopes. This is an unstable situation that can cause complete stripping. While above X 2 , increasing X leads to a radius expansion. The expansion is so significant that, for our adopted opacity laws and a constant η, the evaporation timescale shortens.

So we take τ KH = 10 8 yrs for t &lt; 10 8 yrs t for t ≥ 10 8 yrs .</p><p>Due to the fact a 0 &gt; 0 and the above form of cooling contraction, most of the envelope erosion occurs in the first 100 Myrs, and there is little change to the planet atmosphere after that. To guide our choice for the initial envelope mass, we first ask what kind of planets would have occupied the observed gap, at an age of a few billion years. These are the grey points in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, for cores of terrestrial composition (ρ M ⊕ = 5.5 g cm −3 ), with a range of core mass, initial envelope mass, and orbital period. Since these models would appear in the CKS gap, they are disfavoured by the observations. Now we make the important assumption that planets are born with the same envelope mass and core mass distributions across the range of period of interest (from a few to 100 days). This assumption mostly reflects our ignorance on the proper initial condition, and is almost certainly not true in reality. But under this restrictive assumption, all models that are marked with grey in the right-hand panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> are not permitted. In other words, there are two groups of planets that are likely progenitors for the observed Kepler planets: one group are planets that are slightly more massive (M c &gt; 3 M ⊕ ) and are born with at least a few percent of H/He; the other group, planets that are less massive (M c &lt; 3 M ⊕ ) and that are born, for all purposes, bare. The second group cannot account for planets with radii larger than 1.8 R ⊕ . Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> indicate that the completeness of their exoplanet radius distribution becomes uncertain at small planet radii &lt; 1.14 R ⊕ . Inspection of <ref type="figure">Fig 3 indicates</ref> that planets with masses &lt; 2 M ⊕ (R p = 1.18 R ⊕ ) are disfavoured if they contain H/He envelopes with masses of a few percent or more. Therefore, while the current CKS sample cannot determine if planet occurrence drops significantly below 1.14 R ⊕ we predict it should, unless <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.-For a range of initial envelope mass fractions (y-axis), orbital periods (x-axis) and core masses (represented by different colors, slightly dispersed to the right for clarity), we calculate the final planet radius, at a few Gyrs, due to both cooling contraction and photoevaporation. Models are marked in grey if the final radii fall within the observed gap (R = 1.8 ± 0.2R ⊕ ) and are thus disfavoured by the observations. The left panel shows the period dependence of these models, while the right panel shows the "composite" view: grey indicate any models that are excluded within the range of P = 20 − 100 days (the period range that the gap is clearly visible in data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. 2017</ref>). The initial planet population that can satisfy the observation fall into two categories: planets with masses more than two Earth masses and initial H/He masses more than a few percent; or lower mass planets with essentially no atmosphere. The star is assumed to be sun-like but the results are not particularily sensitive to the stellar mass.</p><p>there is a second population of planets (see §4.7). Moreover, we emphasize that the choice of the mass scale, σ M = 3 M ⊕ , is motivated by both the radii of the bare planets, and the size distribution of planets to the right of the valley.</p><p>Guided by this insight, we adopt a logarithmically flat distribution for X 0 , the initial envelope fraction, with X 0 ∈ [X min , X max ] and X min = 0.01 and X max = 0.3. The value of X max matters little as long as it lies well above 1%, while the value of X min is suggested by <ref type="figure">Fig.  3</ref>, for our choice of core masses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">A few details</head><p>The radius measured for a planet by the transit method is not the photospheric radius (which accounts for the radial light-path for the local black-body photons), but should be determined by the tangent light-path for transmitting stellar photons. The chord is longer for the latter group by a factor of ∼ 8R/H, increasing the transit radius by ∼ ln( 8R/H)H ∼ 3H (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lopez &amp; Fortney 2014</ref>). However, opacity for optical photons is smaller than that for infra-red photons, leading to a "deeper photosphere". These two effects cancel each other to some degree and we decide to ignore them here.</p><p>Another complication arises from how we treat the thermal evolution of the planet in presence of mass-loss. Here, we simply assume the two are independent (eq. 25). This is inappropriate when the envelope is being evaporated faster than cooling contraction. In this case, the lifting of pressure at the top allows the envelope to expand adiabatically. The irradiated atmosphere then actually transports heat inward, maintaining the same internal entropy. The radiative-convective boundary remains fixed at the same density, and the internal entropy can be transported out with the same cooling luminosity as before. This accelerates the cooling compared to the case of no-cooling (this is the physical basis for the "boil-off" discussed in Owen &amp; Wu 2016, see also the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>). We do not correct for this effect in our minimal model, but note that this may lead to enhanced mass loss in some cases; however, models that typically enter this region are on their way to be completely stripped anyway.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>We have used an analytic model to demonstrate that the evaporation valley is a robust outcome of the evolution of close-in, low mass planets with volatile envelopes. The mass-loss timescale always peaks for a H/He envelope of a few percent in mass, where the atmosphere roughly doubles the planet's radius (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen &amp; Rogers 2016)</ref>. This simple combination of planetary structure and evaporation is the origin of the bimodal radius distribution reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref>. Here, we explain these results in more depth, and investigate impacts on our model from various model uncertainties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The origin of the evaporation valley</head><p>The origin for the evaporation valley is schematically shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Consider a group of identical, low-mass planets differing only in their initial envelope mass fractions (X 0 ) and high-energy exposure. Since after the first 100 Myrs, both the stellar flux decays and the planet cools down to a smaller size, the evaporation is dominated by that in the early stages. For a group of planets with the same high-energy exposure, if the peak massloss timescale -t( ˙ X) for X = X 2 -is shorter than 100 Myrs (model d in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>), all envelopes are stripped bare and we expect to see only naked cores, as is the case for the observed Kepler planets at small separations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>). If, on the other hand, the peak mass-loss timescale is longer than 100 Myrs (group c in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>), there is a bifurcation of final envelope massesplanets with initial envelope masses X &lt; X 2 will be completely stripped and present as naked cores; while planets with initial X &gt; X 2 will be herded towards X = X 2 . This manifests as a bifurcation in planet radius, with peaks at both the core size and its double. This bifurcation is the origin of the evaporation valley.</p><p>Lastly, for planets in group a and b which experience too little evaporation, there are little modifications to their atmospheres unless they start with extreme envelope masses (very high or very low). There is still a shepherding toward the above mentioned two peaks, but the widths of the second peak (at twice the core radius) are broader. The observed valley shape can then be used to exclude some of these models, as is done in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, where we show that most of the initial envelopes should have more than a few percent in mass.</p><p>This understanding allows us to derive some useful scalings. These are detailed here and below.</p><p>Since less massive planets can be stripped out to larger distances, the bare population should have a decreasing size (smaller mass and hence smaller core radius) going away from the star. We can derive this by requiring that, for a given core mass, the longest evaporation time (when X = X 2 , or ∆R ∼ R c ) is of order t sat or 100 Myr,</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">t ˙ X (X = X 2 , t = t sat ) ∼ t sat ,<label>(26)</label></formula><p>or,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">GM 2 p X 2 8πR 3 c ∼ ηt sat L HE a 2 ≈ ηX HE (27)</formula><p>where X HE is the high-energy "exposure" for a given planet. Then combining eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(15)</ref> &amp; <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(17)</ref>, we can find the radius of the most massive planet that can be stripped (R bot valley ) at a given exposure as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">R bot valley ∝ η 0.18 X 0.19 HE ρ −0.24 M⊕ .<label>(28)</label></formula><p>Using the high-energy flux dependence on stellar mass ( §3.2), X HE ∝ M * /a 2 , as well as eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref>, we convert the above relation to find R bot valley ∝ P −0.25 , shown as the dotted black line in the left hand panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. This explains the topology of the evaporation valley in the radius-period plane, in models with a constant evaporation efficiency η. As we discuss later, this scaling can change when the evaporation model is different, while the core composition can shift the black line vertically.</p></div>

And indeed our model shows clear dependency on the core composition.</p><p>Following our discussion above, we posit that the valley, independent of the core composition, always lies in-between R c and 2R c . Let us say, √ 2R c . Or</p><formula xml:id="formula_30">R valley ∼ 1.85R ⊕ ρ M⊕ 5.5 g cm −3 −1/3 M c 3 M ⊕ 1/4 .</formula><p>(29) This is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>, where cores of the same mass but different composition exhibit different valleys. An order of magnitude in change in ρ M⊕ leads to an easily detectable shift in the valley position of a factor 2, much larger than the 10% radius errors achieved in the CKS sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Johnson et al. 2017)</ref>, and even large compared to the 30% error in the general Kepler sample. So if the planet mean masses are known, the valley position yields the core composition.</p><p>Interestingly, even when the planet mean masses are not known, if we assume the bimodal radius distribution arises from a single population of planets, we can break the degeneracy and determine the composition. In our model, we successfully reproduce the observed valley using a single population of planets with M c ∼ 3 M ⊕ (see also §4.7) and terrestrial compositions. This does not seem possible for some other compositions. For instance, if the cores are made up largely of ice/water with ρ M ⊕ = 1.3 g cm −3 , the bare cores at R = 1.3 R ⊕ will correspond to M c ∼ 0.5 M ⊕ , and none of these cores can retain enough hydrogen to occupy the second radius peak. Similarly, for pure iron composition (ρ M ⊕ = 11 g cm −3 ), the bare cores should correspond to M c ∼ 6 M ⊕ . However, few of these planets could be evaporated down to naked cores, at the distances that we observe them. So the current data exclude cores that are mostly icy, and favour compositions that are terrestrial-like, i.e., silicateiron composite. This is consistent with RV results from known bare planets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dressing et al. 2015</ref>).</p><p>While these cores are Earth-like, we find that we cannot constrain their iron fractions to a narrow range using current data: in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 8</ref>, we present the expected size distributions for different iron fractions, and all appear largely consistent with data. This could reflect either a genuine composition spread in real planets, or an intrinsically narrow composition spread that is smeared out by errors in the observed data.</p><p>In conclusion, the observed gap suggests that the most common core composition is Earth-like. But the iron fractions in these silicate-iron composite could span a wide range; with a detailed numerical fit to the observed population one maybe able to constrain the Iron fraction to a narrower range.</p></div>

We address this deficiency here.</p><p>We assume that the entire planet, core and atmosphere, cools with a single temperature. This is reasonably accurate for the solid interior, since even the adiabatic temperature gradient is relatively shallow. For an envelope with ∆R 4R c , (X 0.1) the thermal inertia is dominated by gas in the bottom few scale heights close to the core. Gas here likely share the same temperature as the solid part. We further assume that the   core contributes only through its primordial heat, and ignore any radiogenic source. This is valid, especially at early times. For the heat content of the core, we adopt a heat capacity of 10 7 erg g −1 K −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Valencia et al. 2010</ref>, similar to rock), and we assume that the core is made up of SiO 2 molecules with a mean molecular weight of 76 (or per particle specific heat of ∼ 7k B ). The envelope is assumed to be composed of H-atoms with a per particle specific heat of 3/2k B . So including the core contribution to the internal luminosity, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">L = L core + L env ≈ 1 + 7k B × (M c /76m H ) 1.5k B × (XM c /m H ) L env ≈ 1 + 1 17X L env .<label>(30)</label></formula><p>This expression explains the results shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lopez &amp; Fortney (2014)</ref>. We insert this factor into eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> and re-calculate the photo-evaporation process. Core luminosity allows the adiabatic envelope to remain large for a longer time, enhancing mass-loss. However, the overall effect is minor. This is because the evaporation bottleneck is when the envelope mass fraction is of order a few percent (X = X 2 ). At this point, the core contribution to the luminosity is an order unity effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Atmosphere Metallicity</head><p>Some studies of transmission spectroscopy have suggested that the atmospheres of hot Neptunes (e.g., GJ1214b) are highly enriched in metals, with [Z/H] perhaps as high as 100 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Charnay et al. 2015</ref>), while others (e.g. HAT-P-26b) are consistent with solar metallicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wakeford et al. 2017</ref>) . Here we explore how atmosphere metallicity may affect our results. Metallicity enters our model in two ways (eq. 14). First, higher metallicity increases the mean molecular weight (µ), which reduces the scale height at a given temperature. This shrinks the atmosphere, and increases the value of X 2 . Second, higher metallicity increases opacity (κ 0 ), which shifts the convective-radiative boundary. Thus, the atmosphere looks more inflated for a given age. The outcome of our model is determined by the competition between these two effects (also see Howe &amp; Burrows 2015). Reality may be more complicated. The constant energy-efficiency approach we adopt here may be severely invalid if metals affect the driving of the photo-evaporative flow. 7 Metals may have additional thermal effects by, for instance, producing high altitude hazes/clouds.</p><p>Assuming that κ 0 ∝ Z (e.g. Lee &amp; Chiang 2015), we find that, overall, raising the metallicity leads to a slightly larger radius and hence a slightly shorter massloss timescale. The effect maximizes (making a factor of 2 difference in timescale) when the metallicity is 10× solar, but nearly vanishes when it is 100× solar. Such an effect is so small it is eclipsed by other uncertainties in our current model. As a result, we can not make conclusive statement regarding atmosphere metallicity, aside from the fact that the initial atmosphere must be dominated by H/He in number (and so in molecular weight). For example, the observed position in the radius-period plane rules out the presence of "water-worlds" whose volatile envelopes are primarily water/steam. Water/steam atmospheres have a much larger mean-molecular weight (µ ∼ 18) compared to H/He envelopes, this significantly increases the value of X 2 to values more like ∼ 0.5 (Lopez 2016). The increased high-energy exposure required to evaporate an envelope with X = 0.5 (even with an optimistic efficiency of 0.1 for steam atmospheres) results in the evaporation valley appearing at much shorter separations, around a period of 2 days (Lopez 2016), rather than the 10 days it is observed. Therefore, water-worlds making up any reasonable fraction of the Kepler planets is clearly ruled out by the CKS observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Evaporation Efficiency</head><p>There are two reasons why the evaporation efficiency may not be constant for all planets. First, geometry. We define the efficiency η to be based on the light received by the planet disk (R p ). However, the true cross-section is determined the UV/X-ray photosphere. This lies well above the planet photosphere, especially so for planets with large surface scale heights. This raises the efficiency for those planets. Second, physics. Most hydrodynamic models predict that the efficiency should drop as one moves to more massive and/or denser planets. The deeper gravitational potential in this case means it takes the flow a longer time to escape, allowing it to lose more energy by radiative cooling (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Owen &amp; Jackson 2012)</ref>. The "energy-limited" evaporation is only applicable to UV evaporation of weakly irradiated planets (where recombination-equilibrium cannot be reached, and radiative cooling is inefficient on flow-timescales) with low escape velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Owen &amp; Alvarez 2016)</ref>, but not the full range of planets observed to make up the evaporation valley, where recombinations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Murray- Clay et al. 2009</ref>) and X-ray evaporation (e.g. Owen &amp; Jackson 2012) complicate the picture.</p><p>We use a simple model to illustrate these effects. We assume that the efficiency of mass-loss scales as 8</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">η = 0.1 v esc 15km s −1 −2 , (31)</formula><p>where v esc is measured at the planet photosphere and the normalization of 15 km s −1 is chosen to reproduce the observed distribution around 10 days. The power 2 roughly coincides with the result shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 13</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref>, where η ∝ M −3/4 c for earthlike cores in the range 1-10 M ⊕ . We adopt this efficiency scaling over other published scalings (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Salz et al. 2016)</ref> as it is more appropriate for young, active stars which drive most of the mass-loss, rather than older stars where evaporation does not affect a planet's evolution.</p><p>With such an ad-hoc efficiency law, low-mass planets can be stripped out to larger distances, while highmass planets are more resistent to stripping. Re-working through the derivation leading to eq. (28), we obtain R bot valley ∝ P −0.16 , a shallower dependence than that in the constant efficiency model. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig.  9</ref>, where one observes an extended tail of small-planets towards long periods.</p><p>To further illustrate this effect, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 10</ref>, we plot the values of R bot valley for Earth-like cores and those with a composition of 1/3 Ice, 2/3 silicates, using the Fortney et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2007)</ref> mass-radius relationship. This figure demonstrates that, with a large enough sample of planets, and a ∼ 10% radius errors, one could in principle distinguish between different evaporation models and different core compositions. The bottom panel translates the radius into planet core mass, demonstrating how the mass of the most massive stripped core depends on orbital period, for any of the models. Follow-up mass measurements can test these predictions.</p><p>Finally, we have not considered non-thermal escape processes such as stellar wind stripping. This is because hydrodynamic evaporation dominates for the separations we are interested in here (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Murray-Clay et al. 2009</ref>). We have also not included the effects of a planetary magnetic field. Presence of a magnetic field strong enough to retain its dipolar structure (despite the evaporation) close to the planet may suppress the mass-loss rates significantly (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Owen &amp; Adams 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kho- dachenko et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Owen &amp; Adams 2016)</ref>. Unfortunately, it is unknown if the Kepler planets possess sufficiently strong fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Stellar Mass</head><p>The deficit of planets between R c and 2R c results from interaction between planet internal structure and photoevaporation. It is not sensitive to stellar mass. Indeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. (2017)</ref> report that the valley remains the same for all stars in their sample.</p><p>On the other hand, the actual morphology of the valley, i.e., the relative height of the two peaks, the widths of the peaks, the shape of the valley in period space, etc., depends on stellar mass. When plotting planet radii for a population that have a spread in host masses, it is easiest to see the evaporation valley when the horizontal axis is chosen to be the period, not bolometric insolation as commonly assumed. As eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(20)</ref> shows, if we assume that L sat ∝ M * , the evaporation timescale scales with orbital period and stellar mass as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_33">t ˙ X ∝ P 1.41 M −0.48 * ,<label>(32)</label></formula><p>i.e., a weak dependence on stellar mass. Alternatively, if one takes the horizontal axis as the stellar insolation (I ∝  L * /a 2 , or equivalently, planet equilibrium temperature),</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">t ˙ X ∝ I 1.06 M 2.2 * .<label>(33)</label></formula><p>This latter has a stronger mass dependence; as a result, the evaporation valley is less distinct <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 10</ref> of ). Similarly, but to a lesser degree, is plotting by semi-major axis, with t ˙ X ∝ a 2.12 M −1.19 * . Ultimately, the stellar mass independent variable to use is high energy exposure (the total received high-energy flux over the planet's lifetime); however, the down side is high energy exposure is a model dependent quantity and not observationally accessible for individual planets. The current high energy flux received by a planet at billions of years evolution is not representative of its high energy exposure (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tu et al. 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Two populations of planets?</head><p>Envelope stripping becomes decreasingly important as one moves away from the star. For our assumed population of gas-rich planets, this means, going outward, there should be fewer bare cores, and these bare cores should be lower in mass (smaller in size). For example, <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> (the dotted black line) indicates that there should be no bare planets of mass 3 M ⊕ (R c = 1.3 R ⊕ ) beyond orbital periods of 30 days and no bare planets of mass 1 M ⊕ beyond orbital periods of 60 days (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lopez &amp; Rice 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">9 Furthermore, Owen &amp; Jackson (2012)</ref> showed that the hydrodynamical outflow we posit here do not happen for planets much outside 30 days. Rather, the evaporative outflows is so rarefied the gas stops being collisional before the sonic point is reached and the massloss rate is instead determined by Jeans' escape and falls much below the hydrodynamic value.</p><p>Interestingly, despite the selection effects against detecting small planets at large distances, they appear to be present in the Kepler sample. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The radius error bars remain large. And the abundance of such planets are not yet solidly established. However, if future observations confirm that such planets are abundant, this will require a separate population of planets than that posited here. This population is born bare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have developed a minimal analytical model which allows us to efficiently follow the evolution of low-mass planets, under the combined effects of cooling contraction and mass loss by evaporation, aside from illuminating the controlling physics. This model show that the mass-loss timescale peaks at around where planet sizes are doubled by their H/He envelopes, also where the envelope mass is of order a few percent. The timescale drops below this value because, while the envelope becomes more tenuous, the planet radii remain largely constant and so do the photo-evaporating fluxes they receive. The timescale also drops above this value because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass.</p><p>As a result, photoevaporation naturally gives rise to a final planet distribution that is bimodal in radius, peaking at the naked core size and twice its value. This then explains the observed radius "valley" in the California Kepler Survey sample ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Fulton et al. 2017)</ref>, as well as the steep fall-off of planets beyond ∼ 3R ⊕ in the general Kepler catalogue, for a single population of planets that are born with at least a few percent of H/He envelopes ("water-worlds" with water/steam envelopes are ruled out), this amount of gas lies above the most optimistic estimate for outgassing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Elkins-Tanton 2008;</ref> and suggests that the envelopes were accreted from the protoplanetary discs. In the latter scenario, a few percent or more envelope mass may be natural <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rafikov 2006</ref>). It is roughly the mass of an adiabatic envelope maintained by a planet of a few Earth masses at 0.1 AU (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ginzburg et al. 2016</ref>, for modifications).</p><p>The positions of the peaks and valley also lead us to the following conclusions: the planet masses can be described by a Rayleigh distribution with a mode at 3 M ⊕ , the cores have a composition that is ice-poor. Ice-rich cores move the gap too far above the observed value. The absence of icy cores indicates local assembly of the Kepler planets, as opposed to formation beyond the iceline (followed by large-scale migration). Furthermore, as most of the erosion occurs before 100 Myrs, the Kepler planets must have reached their current orbital locations <ref type="bibr">9</ref> The variation of η ( §4.5) may extend this value out to 50 days ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>) for bare 3 M ⊕ planets and out to 100 days for bare 1 M ⊕ planets. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The CKS sample does not contain enough detection in this range, and it is unclear what the stellar masses of individual planets are.</p><p>well before that time. This rules out the possibility that they were migrated in at late times by dynamical processes (e.g. high-eccentricity migration) and also rules out the suggestion that the dearth of intermediate sized planets on short orbits (the "sub-jovian pampas") is entirely due to tidal stripping during dynamical migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Matsakos &amp; Königl 2016)</ref>. Lastly, current data allow the silicate-iron cores to have a wide spread in iron fraction.</p><p>Planets that can be stripped bare have vanishingly small mass at larger orbital periods. Our energy-limited model does not produce planets of size ∼ 1.3 R ⊕ (or 3 M ⊕ ) much beyond 30 days. We investigate the impacts on this (and other) prediction by factors such as atmosphere metallicity, core luminosity, stellar mass, and evaporation efficiency. None made much difference except perhaps the last one. In our ad-hoc model where the efficiency is higher for less bound atmospheres, we are able to extend the above period limit to ∼ 50 days. This gives hope that a large enough observational sample could discriminate various evaporation models.</p><p>Observationally, there is some evidence small planets appear to exist at orbital periods longer than 50 days in the overall Kepler sample. They are possibly numerous given their low detection probability. If this is confirmed by future observations, then our one-population model, though appearing to explain many of the observed features inward of 100 days, may be insufficient. There may need to be another population of low-mass planets that are born with essentially no envelopes. This separate population will need to have masses M ≤ 3 M ⊕ , so as not to fill in the evaporation valley. Orbital instabilities have been suggested to be common among Kepler systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Pu &amp; Wu 2015)</ref>. Giant impacts among short period planets will happen at speeds well above their surface escape velocities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Agnor &amp; Asphaug 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Marcus et al. 2009</ref>), and will therefore disperse much of the original planetary envelopes. Since these impacts will occur after the natal disk has dispersed, they may give rise to this new population.</p><p>Future improvements are needed to further solidify results here. Theoretically, our results are obtained using a minimal analytical model. This was a deliberate choice in order to provide a basic understanding for the origin of the evaporation valley. We have calibrated our model against mesa calculations, but it still contains a number of assumptions (e.g., constant evaporation efficiency). Work should be carried out with more accurate numerical planetary structure models and more physically motivated evaporation model to determine the exact nature of the birth properties of short-period, lowmass exoplanets. Observationally, planet properties will be refined further by future precision stellar data, allowing more detailed comparison. We have adopted a mass function for the Kepler planets that is Rayleigh with a mode of 3M ⊕ . This prediction should be tested by future mass measurements.</p><p>Notes in proof. While this paper was in review, Jin &amp; Mordasini (2017) submitted a paper which used numerical modelling to reach much of the same conclusions about the composition of the Kepler planets as we do here. An interesting development comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dong et al. (2017)</ref> where they reported a population of "Hop-tunes", Neptune-sized planets at close distances from their host stars, where we predict most planets should have been evaporated to bare cores. Intriguingly, this population only exists around metal-rich stars. This presents currently an unsolved puzzle.</p><p>The authors are grateful to the referee for comments which improved the manuscript.
