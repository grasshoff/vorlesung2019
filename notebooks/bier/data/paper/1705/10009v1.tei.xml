			<abstract>
				<p>We present the detection of long-period RV variations in HD 36384, HD 52030, and HD 208742 by using the high-resolution, fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) for the precise radial velocity (RV) survey of about 200 northern circumpolar stars. Analyses of RV data, chromospheric activity indicators , and bisector variations spanning about five years suggest that the RV variations are compatible with planet or brown dwarf companions in Keplerian motion. However, HD 36384 shows photometric variations with a period very close to that of RV variations as well as amplitude variations in the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) analysis, which argues that the RV variations in HD 36384 are from the stellar pulsations. Assuming that the companion hypothesis is correct, HD 52030 hosts a companion with minimum mass 13.3 M Jup orbiting in 484 days at a distance of 1.2 AU. HD 208742 hosts a companion of 14.0 M Jup at 1.5 AU with a period of 602 days. All stars are located at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage on the H-R diagram after undergone the helium flash and left the giant clump.With stellar radii of 53.0 R ⊙ and 57.2 R ⊙ for HD 52030 and HD 208742, respectively, these stars may be the largest yet, in terms of stellar radius, found to host sub-stellar companions. However, given possible RV amplitude variations and the fact that these are highly evolved stars the planet hypothesis is not yet certain.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The difference between a planet and a brown dwarf is still under debate. One distinction can be made according to different formation mechanisms. Brown dwarf companions are thought to be formed by gravitational collapse in protostellar clouds like stellar binary systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bate 2000)</ref> or the gravitational instability in protostellar disks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boss 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rice et al. 2003</ref>), similar to the formation mechanism for massive planet. However, it is difficult to determine this boundary from observations of specific objects. Another criterion to classify a planet versus a brown dwarf is based on nuclear fusion inside the object. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burrows et al. (1997)</ref> used the criterion that a planet occupies the mass range below the deuterium burning limit of ∼13 M Jup , between this and the mass for the onset of core hydrogen fusion (∼80 M Jup ) objects are brown dwarfs. However, this mass cutoff is difficult to define precisely because the deuterium fusion depends to some extent on the composition of the object such as a helium abundance, an initial deuterium abundance, and a metallicity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spiegel et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Recently, it was suggested that the upper limit to planet masses should be set at 20−30 M Jup <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lovis &amp; Mayor 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sahlmann et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>). On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hatzes &amp; Rauer (2015)</ref> proposed that all objects in the mass range 0.3−60 M Jup are giant planets based on the fact that in the mass-density diagram there are no distinguishing features in density between giant planets and brown dwarfs. The Exoplanet Database 1 lists planets up to 24−25 M Jup , but that is an arbitrary boundary ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schneider et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>Generally, planet or brown dwarf companion surveys using the precise radial velocity (RV) technique are best suited for G and K type stars. Moreover, the surveys were conducted mostly around main-sequence (MS) stars, and there is a lack of statistical data for giant stars. RV surveys have established that there is a distinct lack of brown dwarfs within 3 -4 AU of the solar-type stars and this generally referred to as a brown dwarf desert <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marcy &amp; Butler 2000)</ref>. Despite planet search surveys having monitored thousands of stars so far, few such objects have been discovered around evolved stars: 14 M Jup for HD 13189 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hatzes et al. 2005</ref>); 19.8 M Jup for NGC 4349 <ref type="bibr">No. 127 (Lovis &amp; Mayor 2007)</ref>; 19.4 M Jup for 11 Com ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Liu et al. 2008</ref>), and 37.6 M Jup for HD 119445 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Omiya et al. 2009</ref>). In recent studies, exoplanets have been detected with a frequency of ∼5% for MS stars and ∼10% for giant stars, whereas brown dwarfs are estimated to be around less than 1% of Sun-like stars within ∼3 AU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kraus et al. 2008</ref>) and around 2% for 1 -3 M ⊙ within the period of ∼1000 days ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Borgniet et al. 2017</ref>). While exoplanets are relatively common as stellar companions, brown dwarfs seem to be rare. Finding more brown dwarfs in the desert can provide a key information to star and planet formation because it represents the extreme mass limit of both processes.</p><p>To study the formation mechanisms of planets or brown dwarfs using the RV method, observations of stars with various spectral and luminosity types are imperative. Although several precise RV surveys of evolved stars have been conducted ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Frink et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hatzes et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Setiawan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jones et al.2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lovis &amp; Mayor 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Niedzielski et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sato et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Han et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wittenmyer et al. 2011</ref>), the existence of substellar companions in giant stars is still not clearly understood. Finding more planets can provide an important clue to star and planet formation because they represent the extreme mass limit of both processes.</p><p>In this paper, we present three RV variations around giant stars from the survey. In Sect. 2, we describe the observational data and reduction procedures. We give the stellar characteristics in Sect. 3, and the RV analysis and the nature of the RV measurements for each star are put in Sect. 4. Finally, in Sect. 5, we summarize the result from this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION</head><p>We conducted the Search for Exoplanets around Northern circumpolar Stars (SENS; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. 2015</ref>), which uses the 1.8 m telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) in Korea. About 200 circumpolar stars have been selected for the survey, of which 5% are dwarfs, 40% giants, and 55% stars of unclassified luminosity class covering all spectral types.</p><p>Precise RV observations were carried out using the fiber-fed high-resolution Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kim et al. 2007</ref>) attached to the 1.8 m telescope at BOAO. Among three kinds of available resolutions, R = 90 000, 45 000, and 27 000, the optical fiber of 45 000 is most suitable due to trade off between efficiency and resolution. We used an iodine absorption (I 2 ) cell to obtain precise RV measurements ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Valenti et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Butler et al. 1996)</ref>, which superimposes thousands of molecular absorption lines over the object spectra in the wavelength region of 4900−6100Å6100Å. An exposure time is limited to less than about 20 minutes to reduce the line broadening from differential barycentric motion and it provides an average signal to noise (S/N) of ∼150.</p><p>Basic data reduction was carried out using the IRAF software and the precise RV measurements related to the I 2 analysis were undertaken using the RVI2CELL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Han et al. 2007</ref>). The RV standard star τ Ceti has been monitored since 2003 to check the long-term stability of the BOES. Over this time the star has shown an rms scatter of ∼7 m s −1 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee et al. 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">STELLAR CHARACTERISTICS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Fundamental parameters</head><p>The basic stellar parameters were taken from the HIPPARCOS catalog (ESA 1997). The luminosities came from the result of , that are computed based on V-band photometry with a bolometric correction supplied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Masana et al. (2006)</ref>. The stellar atmospheric parameters of temperature (T eff ), metal abundance ( <ref type="bibr">[Fe/H]</ref>), surface gravity (log g), and micro turbulence (v micro ) were determined using the TGVIT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Takeda et al. 2005</ref>). This was based on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kurucz (1992)</ref> atmosphere models using around 130−150 equivalent width (EW) measurements of Fe I and Fe II lines for each star, which usually require three constraint conditions of excitation equilibrium, ionization equilibrium, and matching the curve of growth shape ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Takeda et al. 2002)</ref>. HD 52030 has a spectral type of K0 III (ESA 1997). The B−V color index and the T eff , however, indicate that the star could be a late K or early M-type giant. The V−K color of 4.08 is more consistent with an M1 III (V−K = 4.05) rather than a K0 III (V−K = 2.31) according to <ref type="bibr">Bessel &amp; Brett (1988)</ref>. HD 208742 listed as spectral type of K5 with unclassified luminosity class <ref type="bibr">(ESA 1997</ref>). The star could be classified as a giant according to the value of the low surface gravity and a large stellar radius compared to that of the dwarf star (see Section 3.2). The HIPPARCOS color index of approximately 1.6 and our estimation of the T eff indicate that the spectral type of HD 208742 is close to a late K or early M. The V−K color of 3.94 is similar to an M0.5 III in <ref type="bibr">Bessel &amp; Brett (1988)</ref>. As a result, HD 208742 should be an early M giant star. The basic stellar parameters are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Stellar radius and mass</head><p>Stellar mass and stellar radius are the major factors in determining the fate of companions in the evolution track of giant stars. We determined the stellar radii and masses from the stellar positions in the color-magnitude diagram with using the theoretical stellar isochrones of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bressan et al. (2012)</ref>. Bayesian estimation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jørgensen &amp; Lindegren 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">da Silva et al. 2006</ref>) was also adopted. We derived R ⋆ = 38.4 ± 3.4 R ⊙ and M ⋆ = 1.14 ± 0.15 M ⊙ for HD 36384, R ⋆ = 53.0 ± 6.1 R ⊙ and M ⋆ = 1.09 ± 0.16 M ⊙ for HD 52030, and R ⋆ = 57.2 ± 7.1 R ⊙ and M ⋆ = 1.18 ± 0.22 M ⊙ for HD 208742.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Rotational period</head><p>As stars evolve away from the MS, they become cooler and rotate slower. Low-amplitude and long-period RV variations in evolved stars may arise from the rotational modulation of surface features such as star spots ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lee et al. 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lee et al. , 2012</ref>. In order to estimate the stellar rotational velocities, we used a line-broadening model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Takeda et al. 2008</ref>) and the automatic spectrum-fitting technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Takeda 1995)</ref>. We estimated the minimum rotational velocities of 4.5 km s −1 for HD 36384, 4.1 km s −1 for HD 52030, and 5.4 km s −1 for HD 208742. Based on the rotational velocities and the stellar radii, we derived the upper limits for the rotational period of 440 ± 40 days for HD 36384, 650 ± 80 days for HD 52030, and 540 ± 70 days for HD 208742.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RADIAL VELOCITY VARIATIONS AND THEIR ORIGINS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Orbital solutions</head><p>We obtained 27 BOES spectra for HD 36384 spanning five years, which show clear periodic variations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The Lomb-Scargle (L-S) periodogram (Scargle 1982) results in a peak of 535.1 days. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the RV data phased to the orbital period superposed on the Keplerian fit. The L-S power of this peak corresponds to a false alarm probability (FAP) of &lt; 1 × 10 −5 (top panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>), adopting the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cumming (2004)</ref> which is based on the goodness-of-the-fit statistic for the difference between the Keplerian fit and the linear fit to the data. The FAP is determined by a Monte Carlo method in which fake data sets containing noise only are compared with the observed power or from the analytic distribution of power <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cumming 2004</ref>). We found a semi-amplitude K = 302.1 ± 20.4 m s −1 and an eccentricity e = 0.13 ± 0.12 for a Keplerian orbital fit.</p><p>Observations for HD 52030 with the BOES took place between December 2010 and March 2016. We gathered a total of 27 spectra during five and half years ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows more obvious linear secular change, which may come from unknown longterm period binary. The RV measurements phased to the orbital period are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.  5</ref>. The L-S periodogram shows a peak at 484 days <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref>). The RV variations could be fitted with a Keplerian orbit with a period of 484.3 ± 4.2 days, a semi-amplitude of 329.0 ± 21.8 m s −1 , and an eccentricity of 0.14 ± 0.14.</p><p>Since February 2010, we have gathered 24 spectra for HD 208742 as displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> and listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. The L-S periodogram of the RV measurements for HD 208742 shows a significant peak at a period of 602.8 days (top panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>). The L-S power of this peak corresponds to a FAP of less than 1 × 10 −4 . We found semi-amplitude K = 303.0 ± 16.6 m s −1 and eccentricity e = 0.06 ± 0.13 for a Keplerian fit.</p><p>The residual RV variations after removing the Keplerian orbital fit are 73.1 m s −1 for HD 36384, 82.1 m s −1 for HD 52030, and 55.4 m s −1 for HD 208742. They are significantly larger than the RV precision for the RV standard star τ Ceti (∼7 m s −1 ) and the typical internal error of individual RV precisions of ∼10.9 m s −1 (HD 36384), ∼11.7 m s −1 (HD 52030), and ∼14.4 m s −1 (HD 208742), respectively. We searched for periodic variations in the residual RV measurements using the L-S periodogram. These show no additional periodic signals (dashed lines in the top panels of Figs. 3, 6, and 9). Large residual RVs can be the typical features of evolved stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Setiawan et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hatzes et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dölinger et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">de Medeiros et al. 2009)</ref>, which tend to increase toward later type stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hekker et al. 2006</ref>). They are most likely to arise from stellar oscillations. These can be stochastic so they may not appear as periodic signals, particularly due to the sparse sampling of the data. The scaling relationships of <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kjeldsen &amp; Bedding (1995)</ref> yield expected RV amplitudes from stellar oscillations of ∼80 m s −1 for HD 36384, ∼186 m s −1 for HD 52030, and ∼194 m s −1 for HD 208742 comparable or greater than the observed residuals after removing the Keplerian fit. Thus, these residuals may be related to the stellar oscillations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Photometric variations</head><p>To search for possible brightness variations that might be caused by the rotational modulation of large star spots, we analyzed the HIPPARCOS photometry data. The data were obtained from December 1989 to February 1993 (HD 36384), from December 1989 to March 1993 (HD 52030), and from December 1989 to February 1993 (HD 208742): a total of 177, 226, and 141 HIPPARCOS measurements were made for HD 36384, HD 52030, and HD 208742, respectively. All stars showed rms scatters of 0.012−0.014 mag. This corresponds to a variation over the time span of the observations of 0.19%, 0.22%, and 0.18% for the three stars, respectively. The L-S of the photometric variations for the stars are shown in Figs. 3, 6, and 9. All three stars exhibit certain level of periodic variations. Especially, HD 36384 show a periodic photometric variations close to the 535-d period seen in RV variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Surface activity</head><p>Large spots, produced by the chromospheric activity, crossing the stellar surface can create a spectroscopic signature that might be misinterpreted as a presence of companion. When searching for exoplanets using the RV technique, thus, the possibility of variations caused by chromospheric activity must be considered. Mg I b triplet lines are excluded from the study due to their location inside I 2 molecular region. The Ca II IRT lines are not suitable either due to significant fringing and saturation of our CCD spectra at wavelengths longer than ∼7500Å∼7500Å.</p><p>The most common indicators of chromospheric activity are the Ca II H &amp; K lines, which are well studied for F to K type stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Montes et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kürster et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lee et al. 2015;</ref>). However, the BOES does not provide a sufficient S/N ratio to estimate EW variations in the Ca II H &amp; K line region. We used the Ca II H line as this spectral region was of higher quality than for the Ca II K feature. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows the Ca II H line region of four BOES spectra, and the chromospherically active star HD 201091 (K5 V) is shown for comparison. Unfortunately, the spectra are of too poor quality to resolve any emission feature that might be present. Possible weak features are visible in the center of Ca II H line for all three stars, although not strong enough to guarantee the presence of the chromospheric activity in the sample. We thus measured variations in H α and H β EW for the sample. Specifically, the H α line is sensitive to the chromospheric structure and conditions in giant stars <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cram &amp; Mullan 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smith et al. 1989</ref>). Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lee et al. (2016)</ref> found that two hydrogen lines of µ UMa show periodic variations (∼473 days) consistent with the secondary RV period of 471 days, whose origin is probably a stellar activity. We measured the EWs using a band pass of ± 1.0 ˚ A for H α and ± 0.8 ˚ A for H β centered on the core of the lines to avoid nearby blending lines and ATM H 2 O absorption lines. The individual chromospheric activity measurements of the H lines in L-S periodograms are shown in the third panel of <ref type="figure">Figs. 3, 6</ref>, and 9. They do not show any significant periodic variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Bisector variations</head><p>In order to investigate other causes that may produce apparent RV variations, such as stellar rotational modulations or pulsations rather than the orbital motion, a spectral line shape analysis was performed using high-resolution stellar lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hatzes, Cochran, &amp; Bakker 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Queloz et al. 2001</ref>). Two bisector quantities were calculated: the velocity span (BVS) and the velocity curvature (BVC). The former is the velocity difference between the two flux levels of the bisector and the latter is the difference of the velocity span of the upper half and lower half of the bisectors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">RESULTS</head><p>We found periodic RV variations in HD 36384, HD 52030, and HD 208742. For HD 36384, the EW variations of the hydrogen lines were examined for any RV fluctuations that would be induced by stellar chromospheric activity. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the L-S periodogram of the H α and H β EW variations (third panel). No correlation was found between the hydrogen line EWs and the RV variations. This means that HD 36384 exhibited at most a modest chromospheric activity at the time of observations. Two kinds of line bisector variations were measured and there is no correlation between the RV and the bisector variations (bottom panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3)</ref>. Finally, the HIPPARCOS photometric data were analyzed for brightness variations in HD 36384 (second panel in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>). The L-S periodogram shows large power at ∼60, ∼140, ∼270, and ∼570 days. The last period is close to the RV period of 535.1 ± 5.3 days. A planetary companion is bound to produce low-amplitude RV variations, the amplitude of which will not vary in time. Therefore, the variation of the amplitude over time can be another diagnostic tool to disprove the companion hypothesis.</p><p>We have applied to our RV data the weighted wavelet Z-transformation (WWZ) developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Foster (1996)</ref>. Wavelet analysis is well-suited to detect transient periodic fluctuations, as well as changes in their parameters, because it can focus attention on a limited time span of the data. However, wavelet transform can often be susceptible to false fluctuations for uneven sampling. By utilizing the test statistic that is similar to the chi-square statistic, follows the usual F-distribution but is less sensitive to the effective number of data, WWZ can detect the time evolution of the period and amplitude even for unevenly sampled time series <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Foster 1996</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> shows WWZ, and the maxima period has barely changed over the observations. However, the amplitude of the RV variation decreased by more than 30%. These results suggest that RV variations are not caused by a companion.</p><p>The L-S periodograms of the HIPPARCOS measurements, the EW variations of the hydrogen lines, and line bisector variations for HD 52030 are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Although the HIPPARCOS measurements show significant peaks at ∼60, ∼160, ∼230, and ∼680 days, they are irrelevant for the RV variations of 484 days. Furthermore, the lack of any significant peaks in the L-S periodograms of chromospheric activity indicators and bisector variations supports that the RV variations of HD 52030 are caused by a companion. By adopting a stellar mass M ⋆ = 1.09 ± 0.16 M ⊙ for HD 52030, we obtain a companion mass m sin i = 13.3 ± 2.3 M Jup and a semi-major axis a = 1.2 ± 0.1 AU <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>).</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, the dominant peak of the HIPPARCOS measurements for HD 208742 is near 450 days, significantly different from the RV period of 602 days. A peak in the L-S periodogram of H β nearly at 600 days has the FAP of about 10%, statistically not meaningful. The periodograms of the bisector also show no periodicity near the 602-day period of the RV variation. All these results together lead us to conclude that the RV variations observed in HD 208742 are not ascribed to an intrinsic stellar process but to an orbiting companion. Adopting a mass M ⋆ = 1.18 ± 0.22 M ⊙ , the companion has a mass m sin i = 14.0 ± 2.0 M Jup at a distance of 1.5 ± 0.2 AU from HD 208742 ( <ref type="table">Table 5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The spectral types for two program stars are reclassified with the results from the literature and our new estimation of the stellar parameters. HD 52030, previously known as a K0 type, is changed to an M1 type and HD 208742, previously known as a K0 with unknown luminosity class, is reclassified to an early M giant. Generally, most giants have intrinsic RV variations and exhibit pulsations and/or surface activities. To determine the nature of the RV variabilities requires comprehensive consideration of all relevant analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Pulsations</head><p>Analyses of rotational periods, H line EW variations, and line bisector measurements of all three stars do not show any obvious evidence of the RV variations caused by a rotational modulation of surface features. However, several strong periods were found in the HIPPAR-COS photometric data, which suggests the possibility of stellar pulsations. In particular, the period of ∼570 days in HD 36384 close to 535 day period in RV variations strengthens the possibility. We further checked for any changes in the amplitude of RV variations as a function of time for HD 36384. Although the sampling of of the RV data is not sufficient for this analysis, the WWZ analysis hints a secular decrease of the amplitude of RV variations over five years. In addition, HD 36384 is classified as a variable star in the SIMBAD database. Even though the mechanism to produce such low-amplitude, long-period pulsation modes is not well understood, we suspect that the current RV variations seen in HD 36384 is more likely to be the result of stellar pulsations rather than an orbiting companion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Fake planets</head><p>There is recent evidence that long-period variations in K giant stars that mimic a planet signal may in fact be intrinsic stellar variability ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Reffert et al. 2015</ref>; Hatzes, private communication). Such RV amplitude change is obviously not compatible with orbiting companions, and the periodic RV variations in such systems are more likely due to the long-period stellar pulsations, known to occur in giant stars. These findings warn us that the usual diagnostic tests for orbiting planets such as comparison of variations of chromospheric activity indicators and BVS/BVC against those of RV spanning less than 3 to 5 years may not be conclusive as previously believed, especially for giant stars. Follow up observations over longer time scale will help to select out such 'fake planet' systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">The fate of companions on the evolution track</head><p>The physical parameters from the Keplerian fit for HD 52030 b, and HD 208742 b place the minimum mass of the companions in the planetary mass region. <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref> shows the distribution of the stellar radii versus the planetary masses. Of the ∼ 3000 host stars harboring companions with known stellar radii, 97% are smaller than subgiant phase of 5 R ⊙ (∼0.025 AU; within an orbit of a 3-day hot Jupiter). The stars crossing the subgiant branch do not undergo significant expansion. The largest host stars discovered so far to have companions are HD 208527 (51.1 R ⊙ ) and HD 13189 (50.39 R ⊙ ). HD 52030 and HD 208742 in our study may be the largest stars with a substellar companion at a radius of 53.0 R ⊙ (0.25 AU) and 57.2 R ⊙ (0.27 AU), respectively. Approximately 65% of companions resided inside 0.25 AU from host stars and most companions around dwarfs will undergo an ineluctable destiny during the evolutionary process.</p><p>The fate of planets around evolved stars may be dramatically altered as the host star evolves off the MS stage. The companions may have been engulfed or moved outward by the expanding host stars when the latter increases its radius as it ascends the red giant branch (RGB) and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). When the Sun climbs the AGB stage with its largest radial extent of 213 R ⊙ (0.99 AU), however, the Earth would move out to 1.69 AU, narrowly escaping being engulfed only in the presence of mass loss ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sackmann et al. 1993</ref>). Recent studies showed that planets with masses smaller than 1 M Jup do not survive during the planetary nebula phase if located initially at an orbital distance closer than 3−5 AU <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Villaver &amp; Livio 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kunitomo et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mustill &amp; Villaver 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mustill et al. 2014</ref>), whereas planets more massive than 2 M Jup survive down to orbital distances of ∼3 AU. For 1.5−5 M ⊙ , planets in orbits within 0.5 AU around RGB stars could have been engulfed by the host stars at the tip of the RGB due to the tidal force from the host stars ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sato et al. 2008</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Johnson et al. (2007)</ref> also considered the possibility that the lack of close-in planets around giants may be attributable to engulfment by the expanding atmospheres of the host stars. <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref> shows HD 36384, HD 52030, and HD 208742 in H−R diagram along with their theoretical evolution tracks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Girardi et al. 2000</ref>). The diagram indicates the evolution of 1.5 M ⊙ and 1.6 M ⊙ stars according to the stellar evolution models with Z = 0.008 (HD 52030 and HD 208742) and Z = 0.019 (HD 36384). The stars are located at the AGB stage on the H-R diagram after having undergone the helium flash leaving the giant clump. It is unclear what happens to the companions when they interact with the atmosphere of their expanding host stars. Thus, if companions exist within 0.25 AU around HD 52030, and HD 208742 in the beginning, there are two possible scenarios for their fate. First, low-mass planets may be engulfed. Second, companions more massive than 2 M Jup may be pushed out to close distance. The companions at 1.2−1.5 AU detected in this paper are probably impervious to the effect of the evolutionary process. There may be unusual cases in which a short-period substellar companion survives the engulfment as its parent star evolve into a white dwarf ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Maxted et al. 2006</ref>).</p><p>The current knowledge of the evolutionary tracks for evolved stars is not sufficient enough to predict the fate of these systems. We need to understand the dynamics of planetary systems around the largest evolving giants. Furthermore, the number of large stars with planetary companions is limited. Future surveys will provide us more candidates, allowing us to better trace the shape of the companion mass function and offer us some understanding of the origin and history of these systems.      </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>To avoid contaminations, unblended spectral features with high flux levels and free of the I 2 absorption lines were chosen. The BOES iodine cell has negligible absorption lines beyond about 6200Å6200Å. So, we selected 11 spectral lines of V I 6251.8, Fe I 6262.6, Ti I 6325.2, Cr I 6330.1, Fe I 6335.3, Fe I 6411.6, Fe I 6421.4, Ca I 6499.7, Fe I 6574.2, Fe I 6593.9, and Ni I 6767.8 ˚ A. The difference between the bisectors of the profiles at flux levels of 0.8 and 0.4 of the central depth were used as velocity spans, which thereby avoid the spectral core and wing where errors of the bisector measurements are large. The average BVS and BVC were computed using the bisector measurements of all 11 spectral lines after subtracting the mean value for each spectral line. Figure 3, 6, and 9 (bottom panel ) show L-S periodograms of BVS and BVC for each star, respectively. None of them exhibit any meaningful periodic variations.</figDesc></figure>
