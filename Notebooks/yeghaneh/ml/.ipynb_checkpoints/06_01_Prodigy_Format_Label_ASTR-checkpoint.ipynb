       " 'I therefore appeal to the observations of subsequent years, at least those that experienced observers made.',\n",
       " 'For if in any respect I have given free rein to my inclinations in one direction, it will only go so much the farther into error on the other side.',\n",

       " 'You see at κ a small defect from the circle, at η, θ on both sides, a rather large one, enough so that we cannot excuse it by uncertainties in observing (for in Chapter 42 I reckon an uncertainty of perhaps 200, or at most 300 units).',\n",
       " 'What, then, is to be said?',\n",
       " \"Could this actually be the situation described in Chapter 6 above, in which by transposition of the reference point from the sun's mean motion to its apparent motion I set up another eccentric that makes an excursion towards the side of the sun's apogee?\",\n",
       " 'By no means.',\n",
       " 'For there, it would approach from the one side by the same amount as it moves away on the other.',\n",
       " 'Here, however, you see that the planet approaches the center from the circular orbit on both sides.',\n",
       " 'This is confirmed by many other observations, some of which follow below in Chapters 51 and 53.',\n",
       " \"Clearly, then, [what is to be said] is this: the orbit of the planet is not a circle, but comes in gradually on both sides and returns again to the circle's distance at perigee.\",\n",
       " 'They are accustomed to call the shape of this sort of path  \"oval.\"',\n",
       " 'This same thing is also proved from Chapter 43 preceding.',\n",
       " 'There it was  supposed that the area of a perfect eccentric is very closely equivalent to all the distances of the equal parts of the circumference of that eccentric from the source of the motive power, however many they are.',\n",
       " 'Thus, the parts of the area measure the amounts of time which the planet spends on the parts of the corresponding eccentric circumference.',\n",
       " 'But if that area about which the planet marks a boundary is not a perfect circle, but is diminished at the sides from the amplitude it has at the apsides, and if nevertheless this area circumscribed by an irregular orbit still measures the times which the planet takes to traverse the whole and its equal parts, then this diminished area measures a time equal to that measured by the previous undiminished area.',\n",
       " 'So the parts of the diminished area nearest aphelion and perihelion will measure a greater time, because in those regions the diminution is narrowest, but the parts at the middle longitudes measure less time than before, because the greatest diminution in the whole area occurs there.',\n",
       " 'So if we now use the diminished area in adjusting the equations, the planet will become slower near aphelion and perihelion than it was in the previous faulty form of equation, and swifter near the middle elongations, because here the distances are lessened.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, the times, when they are abstracted from the area and adjusted upward and downward, will be accumulated at aphelion and perihelion in much the same manner as, if one were to squeeze a fat-bellied sausage at its middle, he would squeeze and squash the ground meat, with which it is stuffed, outwards from the belly towards the two ends, emerging above and below his hand ^4.',\n",
       " 'And indeed, if contraries remedy one another, this is plainly the aptest medicine for purging the faults under which, in Chapter 43 above, our physical hypothesis was perceived to be laboring.',\n",
       " 'For the planet is going to be swifter at the middle elongations, where previously it was perceived to be going slower than it should, and it will be slowed down above and below, near the apsides, where previously it did violence to the equations belonging to the eighths of the period through its excessive fleetness.',\n",
       " 'This, then, is the other argument by which it is proved that the orbit of the planet really is deflected from the established circle, making ingress towards the sides and the centre of the eccentric.',\n",
       " \"But for all that, this argument still did not have enough effect upon me to let me go beyond it and think about the planet's departure from the orbit.\",\n",
       " 'When I had sweated for the longest time trying to reconcile equations of this sort, I was finally discouraged by the absurdity of the measurements, and abandoned the whole enquiry until I was informed by the distances (found in the way shown in Chapter 41) about the departure from the [circular] orbit, and once more took up this problem of the equations.',\n",
       " 'And from this, what I promised I would prove, in Chapters 20 and 23 above, is now done: that the orbit of the planet is not a circle but of an oval shape.']"
