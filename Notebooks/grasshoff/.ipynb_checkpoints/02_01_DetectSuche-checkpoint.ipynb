       "'Analysing the photometrical data taken from the Kepler Mission Database, the results obtained from both the One Phase Exponential Association model derived for the flare activity and the spot migration on the surface of eclipsing binary system KIC 11560447 are presented. A sinusoidal variation due to the rotation modulation is defined. There are two cool spots separated by about 100° longitudinally. It is seen that the parameters of these spotted areas such as radii, latitudes and longitudes, were varying during observing seasons. Apart from the cool spots, flare activity is also detected on the target, and 226 flares were determined with their parameters. Modelling the distribution of flare equivalent durations versus the flare total times, the Plateau parameter was found to be 1.4114 ± 0.1712 s in the logarithmic scale, while the Half-time value was found to be 2394.03 s. The frequency of flare N<SUB>1</SUB>, which is the number of flares per an hour in the system, was computed as 0.064454 h<SUP>-1</SUP> , while the flare-equivalent duration emitting per an hour, N<SUB>2</SUB> frequency, was found to be 0.000058.'"

       "'We investigate the role that planet detection order plays in the Kepler planet detection pipeline. The Kepler pipeline typically detects planets in order of descending signal strength (MES). We find that the detectability of transits experiences an additional 5.5 per cent and 15.9 per cent efficiency loss, for periods &lt;200 days and &gt;200 days respectively, when detected after the strongest signal transit in a multiple-planet system. We provide a method for determining the transit probability for multiple-planet systems by marginalizing over the empirical Kepler dataset. Furthermore, because detection efficiency appears to be a function of detection order, we discuss the sorting statistics that affect the radius and period distributions of each detection order. Our occurrence rate dataset includes radius measurement updates from the California Kepler Survey (CKS), Gaia DR2, and asteroseismology. Our population model is consistent with the results of Burke et al. (2015), but now includes an improved estimate of the multiplicity distribution. From our obtained model parameters, we find that only 4.0± 4.6{{ per cent}} of solar-like GK dwarfs harbour one planet. This excess is smaller than prior studies and can be well modelled with a modified Poisson distribution, suggesting that the Kepler Dichotomy can be accounted for by including the effects of multiplicity on detection efficiency. Using our modified Poisson model, we expect the average number of planets is 5.86 ± 0.18 planets per GK dwarf within the radius and period parameter space of Kepler.'"

       "'Most massive stars, if not all, are in binary configuration or higher multiples. These massive stars undergo supernova explosions and end their lives as either black holes or neutron stars. Recent observations have suggested that neutron stars and perhaps even black holes receive large velocity kicks at birth. Such natal kicks and the sudden mass loss can significantly alter the orbital configuration of the system. Here we derive general analytical expressions that describe the effects of natal kicks in binaries on hierarchical triple systems. We explore several proof-of-concept applications such as black hole and neutron stars binaries and X-ray binaries with either stellar or Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) companions on a wide orbit. Kicks can disrupt the hierarchical configuration, although it is harder to escape the potential well of an SMBH. Some binary systems do escape the SMBH system resulting in hyper-velocity binary system. Furthermore, kicks can result in increasing or decreasing the orbital separations. Decreasing the orbital separation may have significant consequences in these astrophysical systems. For example, shrinking the separation post-supernova kick can lead to the shrinking of an inner compact binary that then may merge via Gravitational Wave (GW) emission. This process yields a supernova that is shortly followed by a possible GW-LIGO event. Interestingly, we find that the natal kick can result in shrinking the outer orbit, and the binary may cross the tertiary Roche limit, breaking up the inner binary. Thus, in the case of SMBH companion, this process can lead to either a tidal disruption event or a GW-LISA detection event (Extreme Mass ratio inspiral, EMRI) with a supernova precursor.'"
